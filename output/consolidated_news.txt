Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Magamorphosis Is Making Even More Sense Now

It’s becoming more and more difficult for Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s newly red-pilled CEO, to claim the rightward shift at his company reflects business as usual. According to a new report in The New York Times, Trump ally and surrogate Stephen Miller told Zuckerberg in December that the president-elect planned to go to war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the Meta chief has now axed just ahead of Trump taking office. At the same Mar-a-Lago meeting, the Times reported, Zuckerberg blamed Meta’s progressive culture on his “close friend” and former colleague, Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg reportedly “signaled” to Miller and other senior Trump advisers “that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda,” according to the Times, and that in the coming months, his company would “focus solely on building tech products.” And as part of that shift, Zuckerberg reportedly added, Meta would soon announce layoffs and additional guidelines to “reset” the company’s culture. (Miller and Meta officials declined to comment to the Times.) All of those things have since come to pass, less than two months after Zuckerberg and Miller’s tête-à-tête. In addition to killing its DEI program—a move the company blamed on the shifting “policy landscape” in the US—Zuckerberg has downsized Meta’s moderation efforts, cancelled a nine-year fact-checking project and railed against the “neutering” of corporate culture on Joe Rogan’s podcast. On Wednesday, Meta also announced plans to cut five percent of its workforce, or roughly 3,600 people, though it’s not yet clear which teams will be impacted. The company’s long-time global policy chief, Nick Clegg, has already departed. The Times’ reporting sheds further light on Meta’s MAGAfication—and the larger, political realignment taking place inside Big Tech. While Silicon Valley has long served as a reliable stronghold for Democrats, many of its foremost leaders have lately cozied up to Trump and his administration. In addition to Zuckerberg, at least half a dozen prominent tech CEOs—including Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman—will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, Axios reported. They join Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who will sit on the inaugural dais alongside the Trump family, Elon Musk and a host of other notables. Tech executives do potentially have much to gain from a friendship with Trump: During his first term, the president-elect showed apparent preference for companies that aligned with him. His deregulatory agenda could also benefit US tech firms, which chafed under departing President Joe Biden’s approach to antitrust law, artificial intelligence and the taxation of the ultrarich. In his farewell address on Wednesday, Biden warned about the rise of “a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers” to society. “Today,” Biden said, “an oligarchy is taking shape in America … that literally threatens our entire democracy.” Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires In Memoriam: David Lynch Saw the Nightmare Beneath the American Dream See Our Predictions for This Year’s Oscar Nominations How Donald Trump’s Obsession With “Y.M.C.A.” Broke Down the Village People Why Renée Zellweger “Needed to” Stop Acting for 6 Years Burning at Both Ends: Surviving a Week in Wildfire-Torn Los Angeles MAGA-verse’s Clash of Titans: Bannon vs. Musk Prince Harry Planted a Ticking Time Bomb Under the Murdoch Empire The Best Rom-Coms of All Time From the Archive: Portraits of Picasso’s Marriage

Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker

Intel’s (INTC) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Mason Hawkins' Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) stands against the other stocks. Mason Hawkins is a prominent figure in the world of value investing, best known as the founder and chairman of Southeastern Asset Management, an investment firm established in 1975. The firm began with a modest pool of assets but grew to manage approximately $20 billion within a few years. With decades of experience and a reputation for disciplined investment strategies, Hawkins has earned widespread respect among investors and financial professionals for his long-term approach to wealth creation. His firm specializes in managing concentrated portfolios based on in-depth research, fundamental analysis, and a value-oriented philosophy. Hawkins believes that patience and a contrarian mindset are critical to success, often holding onto investments for years to allow their true value to emerge.

This strategy has been central to the success of the flagship Longleaf Partners Funds run by Southeastern Asset Management. For example, during the 20 years leading up to the mid-2000s, the fund achieved an annualized return of approximately 12%, compared to around 10% for the S&P 500. A native of Tennessee, Hawkins graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Finance and later earned his MBA from the University of Georgia. His early career included roles at Atlantic National Bank and First Tennessee Investment Management before he decided to establish Southeastern Asset Management. Under his leadership, the firm grew from managing a small pool of assets to overseeing billions of dollars across various funds. One hallmark of the investment style made popular by Hawkins is his emphasis on what he calls a "margin of safety." This concept, pioneered by Benjamin Graham, involves purchasing stocks at a significant discount to their estimated intrinsic value. By doing so, Hawkins aims to minimize downside risk while maximizing potential returns. This disciplined approach has helped Southeastern Asset Management weather multiple market cycles, including challenging periods like the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. Hawkins focuses on quality rather than quantity, reflected in the 13F portfolio of his fund that typically holds positions in twenty to thirty stocks, highlighting a preference for concentration rather than diversification. This approach allows the firm to take significant positions in companies it believes in, leading to outsized returns when these investments succeed.

Overall XPO ranks 14th on our list of Billionaire Mason Hawkins' top long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of XPO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Legend Biotech Corporation (LEGN): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While 2024 was a “challenging” year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two. Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity. Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed’s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an “option-like structure” if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates. Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank’s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks. Flood’s note also highlighted that the biotech industry has recently shown improved fundamentals, attributed to a more favorable regulatory environment and positive clinical outcomes. Despite these tailwinds, Goldman’s data reflects that biotechnology remains under-owned by hedge funds. The sector ranked in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year. Furthermore, it ranked in the 4th percentile over the past five years. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of 40 biotech stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 15, 2025. We have also included the market capitalization of the stocks as of the same date. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds, as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory with workers in masks and lab coats focused on analyzing cell therapies. Analyst Upside: 161.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) is a clinical-stage company that develops, discovers, manufactures, and commercializes novel therapies for oncology and other indications. It develops advanced cell therapies across an elaborate range of technology platforms. The company operates in the US, China, and other geographical segments. It experienced solid sales growth for CARVYKTI® in fiscal Q3 2024. CARVYKTI treats multiple myeloma and is the first and only cell therapy that is clinically shown to significantly increase the overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. The company also increased its commercial capacity for the drug, delivering it to patients across the globe. It accounted for net trade sales of around $286 million in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting operational growth of 87.6% year-over-year and 53.2% quarter-over-quarter. Due to the drug’s transformational nature, Legend Biotech Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGN) recently initiated commercial production at its facility in Belgium to fulfill the demand for CARVYKTI worldwide. It plans to expand its capacity further while simultaneously advancing its R&D programs as part of its long-term strategy to be a leader in cell therapy innovation. TimesSquare Capital U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “We began buying shares in Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN), a biotechnology developer of cell therapies to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and leukemia. The European Union approved the use of Legend’s Carvykti treatment of multiple myeloma and later the FDA followed suit. Some investors may have been concerned about possible delays as Legend ramps up production, and its price declined. Though with a long-standing agreement with Johnson & Johnson and a new partnership with Novartis, we see a long runway of growth ahead, so we initiated a position.” Overall, LEGN ranks 2nd on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of biotech stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LEGN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Goldman Sachs boosts David Solomon's pay 25% — and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO

Goldman Sachs (GS) is locking in CEO David Solomon for at least another five years with a sweet stock deal — along with a big, annual pay increase. The investment bank is offering Solomon 130,508 restricted stock units, valued at $80 million, with a five-year vesting period, Goldman disclosed in a regulatory filing dated Thursday. President and chief operating officer John Waldron — considered Solomon’s leading successor — received the same retention package. These so-called retention grants or RSUs are a sign that the firm plans to hold onto their executives, at least for the duration of the vesting period. That’s on top of the $39 million total compensation package given to Solomon for 2024, up a hefty 25.8% from $31 million in 2023. That puts Solomon’s pay up there with leaders at other top banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who received a $36 million compensation package in 2023, and former Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman, who made $37 million in his last year with the firm. Other Wall Street banks have not yet disclosed their CEO compensation for the 2024 fiscal year. Goldman attributed the pay bump to the firm’s strong performance last year, including a “significant year-over-year improvement as a result of strategic execution.” The firm also pointed to a “48% increase in stock price, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and 7% book value per share growth, resulting in record amount of capital returned to common shareholders in 2024.” Goldman reported Wednesday that it saw $13.87 billion in net revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 23% year-over-year jump. Profit more than doubled to $4.11 billion, for the fourth quarter, from $2.01 billion a year ago. For the full year, Goldman brought in net revenues of $53.51 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Posted on 01/17/2025 7:50:29 AM PST by karpov As the smoke clears from devastating Los Angeles wildfires, efforts to clean up the affected areas are being complicated by burnt-out electric and hybrid vehicles and home-battery storage systems. Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire victims’ return to their properties. “A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,” said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. “We’ve heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near homes — like those with power walls — for much longer.” The L.A. wildfires, which began Jan. 7, have taken at least 27 lives and destroyed thousands of homes. While the dry, dangerous winds are forecast to end — a lack of rain and another possible round of winds next week has kept officials concerned that the danger is not over. Estimates for insurance losses from the fires have rapidly jumped to as high as $40 billion and BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink has warned it could take a decade to rebuild the city. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already allocated $100 million to the cleanup effort. There were over 431,000 Teslas in operation in the Los Angeles area as of October 2024, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Based on new registrations, their market share locally was three times that of the rest of the nation. The Tesla Model Y was the biggest-selling vehicle in the state through September, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

People will be required to continue to pay their mortgages and property taxes even if their homes are ashes. This means a majority of the owners will lose their property which ultimately will be confiscated by the government or speculators who will obtain it from the banks and pay off the taxes. Suspect in the long run most of the property owners will have to absorb huge losses and simply move and start over. The weird envioros will get their way and much of the burned areas after the debris is cleared will return to wilderness. After 300years, few will know it ever happened. 13 posted on 01/17/2025 8:05:58 AM PST by allendale [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Sacajaweau I believe they use special blankets to put the fires out.

Yes and no. The special blankets don't put the fire out, just cover the EV's while they keep burning. It's to prevent other things around the EV from catching fire. But if everything around the EV is already burning, there's no value added from the special EV fire blankets. 16 posted on 01/17/2025 8:08:34 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Amazon to lay off 200 people in its North America retail operations

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said it is cutting a small number of roles after a routine evaluation of its team structures and ability to “move fast.” Amazon has eliminated roles across its retail team in North America, impacting about 200 people in both physical store and e-commerce operations, the company confirmed Thursday. The cuts are being made as part of the company’s regular evaluation of its team structures “to ensure we’re best set up to move fast as we innovate for customers,” according to an Amazon spokesperson. “We’ve adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities,” the spokesperson said by email. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” This downsizing is unrelated to Amazon’s decision to end its Try Before You Buy program, a service that allows a trial period for certain apparel, footwear and accessories. In that case, the company said that more people are increasingly using tech that allows them to get a sense of how items fit before they place an order. Last year the e-commerce giant also announced layoffs in its retail division. In January 2024 that included several hundred roles in its Alexa team and several others in its Buy With Prime team. The previous year the company announced more substantial job cuts, also mostly in retail. Overall in the industry, job cuts spiked last month, although retailers are also still hiring, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Title: LVMH's Bernard Arnault ousts Larry Ellison as the world's 4th-richest person after gaining $15 billion in one day

A fashion mogul has gained more wealth this year than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or anyone else on the global rich list. Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has become about $14 billion richer already in 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He leapfrogged Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison on Thursday to take fourth place on Bloomberg's rich list with an estimated $190 billion fortune, adding $15 billion to his net worth in just one day. The luxury tycoon has gained more wealth this year than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was up nearly $12 billion at Thursday's market close, and the "Donald of Dubai" Hussain Sajwani, up around $10 billion. Zuckerberg and Musk are the next-biggest gainers. The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively. Arnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. The shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont — the owner of brands like Cartier and Chloé — reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa. Consumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers. Arnault, nicknamed the "Wolf in Cashmere," was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion. Even accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion. The group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.

Title: Supreme Court Upholds TikTok Ban, App May Shut Down Jan. 19 in the U.S.

Trump says he needs 'time to review the situation' before deciding on next steps By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok could fade to black in the U.S. in a matter of days after the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to halt a law that will ban the popular video app as of Jan. 19 unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. “There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the Supreme Court wrote in its unanimous opinion in the case issued Friday morning. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.” Related Stories VIP+ 2024 Lookback: A Watershed Year for Generative AI in Hollywood Ridley Scott’s ProdCo RSA Revisits Real Story Behind ‘Black Hawk Down’ in New Netflix Documentary (EXCLUSIVE) The court said that “we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.” The Supreme Court affirmed the Dec. 6 judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the national security risks presented by TikTok’s Chinese ownership justified the divest-or-ban law. Popular on Variety In response to the ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump “for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.” ByteDance has not publicly indicated any willingness to sell its TikTok stake. TikTok has told employees that they will still have jobs regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In the event of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, TikTok has been planning to shut down the app in the U.S. on Sunday, Jan. 19. At that point, TikTok users will see a pop-up message linking to a site with information about the ban. TikTokers also will have the option to download their personal data. There still could be wiggle room for TikTok to avoid an immediate shutdown. The Biden administration is leaving the question of what to do about TikTok to Trump, set to be sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump, in a post Friday on Truth Social, wrote: “The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!” Trump is trying to position himself to be seen as TikTok’s savior: He is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of the law for 60-90 days while he tries to hammer out a resolution to keep TikTok available, as first reported by the Washington Post — although it’s questionable whether Trump has the legal authority to pause the divest-or-ban law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump may also instruct the government to not enforce the ban. But given that the law imposes fines of $5,000 per user on companies that distribute or host the TikTok app, tech companies like Apple, Google and Oracle (which has an agreement to host TikTok user data in the U.S.) may be reluctant to flout the ban. On Friday, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping and “discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!” Meanwhile, Trump has invited TikTok’s Chew to attend the incoming president’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., and to “sit in a position of honor on the dais,” per the New York Times. The shutdown of the TikTok app in the United States would be a boon to rival platforms including Meta’s Instagram, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat. Amid the looming threat of the TikTok ban, Chinese-owned social app Xiaohongshu (aka Red Note) has soared in popularity this past week. In May 2024, TikTok and ByteDance sued the U.S. government over the divest-or-ban law, arguing the legislation violates the First Amendment rights of its U.S. users. In addition, two groups of TikTok users and creators filed petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the law. But the Supreme Court sided with the law’s backers, who have claimed TikTok represents a national security threat because Beijing-based ByteDance is subject to oversight by the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance and TikTok have claimed the Chinese government has never requested access to TikTok user data — and that they would not turn it over if that were the case. The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that, according to the U.S. government, ByteDance “has previously declined to agree to stop collecting U.S. user data or sending that data to China to train the algorithm.” In addition, “The Government has further noted the difficulties associated with monitoring data sharing between ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc. … Under these circumstances, we find the Government’s data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions.” “Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age,” the Supreme Court said in its opinion. “But TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns.” American lawmakers who backed the legislation have claimed it is not technically a ban because it offers ByteDance a choice: to divest TikTok’s U.S. business or to have the app shut down. TikTok and ByteDance, in their lawsuit, argued that “in reality, there is no choice,” saying the forced divestiture required by the law in order for TikTok to be allowed to continue operating in the country “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.” Chinese officials reportedly have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Last year, the TikTok divest-or-ban legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support. It was signed into law by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have voiced concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda — despite providing no public evidence that the Chinese government has demand TikTok turn over user data or promote specific content. The law doesn’t mandate the shutdown of TikTok per se. Rather, it prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. (under penalty of monetary fines) unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to an entity based in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Title: What's In Store For Merck Stock In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/17/whats-in-store-for-merck-stock-in-2025/

CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American multinational pharmaceutical company ... [+] Merck (NYSE: MRK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Merck stock (NYSE: MRK) lost about 10% in 2024, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which gained 23% for the year. Despite strong performances from other pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly stock (up 31%) and AbbVie stock(up 15%), Merck’s stock performance has been muted. This is attributed to declining sales of its blockbuster HPV vaccine – Gardasil – and an increased competition for some of its drugs, including Januvia. As an aside, new gaming products can be impactful. See Will New Switch Give A Boost To Nintendo Stock? In this note, while we briefly touch upon Merck’s performance in 2024, we focus on the impact on MRK stock and how 2025 could turn out. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Three trends were clearly visible for Merck in 2024. Firstly, the cash cow – Keytruda – continued to gain market share with approval in more indications. Keytruda’s last twelve-month sales now stand at a whopping $28 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2023. Secondly, the next best-selling product – Gardasil – faced headwinds in China, resulting in its sales falling in the recent quarters. The last-twelve month period sales of $9 billion align with the figure reported in 2023. This comes after a stellar 31.5% annual average growth rate Gardasil posted in the last three years. A crackdown on the healthcare industry in China has impacted on the overall vaccination rate in China. Lastly, it saw an improvement in gross margins, thanks to lower royalty rates for Keytruda and Gardasil. 2024 was also the year where Merck looked at inorganic growth to expand its pharmaceuticals and animal health business. It acquired Elanco’s aqua business for $1.3 billion, Harpoon Therapeutics for $680 million, LaNova Medicines for $588 million, Curon for $750 million, and EyeBio for $1.3 billion, among others. Merck may continue to eye inorganic growth to combat with the fall in sales, when Keytruda sees biosimilar competition (likely in 2029). It will be a massive gap to bridge, given that Keytruda is one of the top-selling drugs globally. MRK stock declined gradually from levels of $110 in early January last year to $99 by the end of 2024. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in MRK stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 1% in 2023, and -6% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Merck’s Valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 30% upside from its current market price of $100. At its current levels, MRK stock is trading at 4x trailing revenues, compared to the stock’s average P/S ratio of 4.5x over the last three years. 2025 is likely going to be better for Merck. Keytruda is expected to continue to lead the growth, with its approval for more indications lately. However, Gardasil’s decline in China may continue to weigh on the company’s vaccine sales in 2025. Merck’s diabetes drugs – Januvia and Janumet – are likely to see increased competition. The company’s animal health business is likely to benefit from increased pet ownership in the U.S. We expect the company to maintain its higher gross margins on the back of better product mix. Merck may also secure the regulatory approval for clesrovimab – an antibody for RSV treatment in infants. If approved, clesrovimab has the potential to garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. The U.S. FDA has set a deadline of June 10 to make a decision on approval of clesrovimab. Overall, MRK stock looks like it will have more positives to aid it in 2025. With its stock trading at 4x trailing revenues, we think the potential headwinds for Gardasil are largely priced in. While MRK stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Merck’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here.

A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are.

Title: Ozempic could get cheaper as Medicare eyes drug price negotiations — and Novo Nordisk stock slips

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said Friday that it had selected another 15 drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including the popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Negotiations between the federal government and drugmakers are slated to occur in 2025, with any new prices set to take effect in 2027. Pharmaceutical companies have until Feb. 25 to decide if they will participate in negotiations. Along with Wegovy and Ozempic, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has tapped Xtandi, Ibrance, Calquence, and Pomalyst, which are used to treat various types of cancer, for price negotiations. Otezla, a psoriasis medicine; Vraylar, an antipsychotic.; and Trelegy Ellipta, an inhaler used to treat emphysema and asthma, were also picked. According to the CMS, the drugs selected were used by 5.3 million people with coverage under Medicare Part D between November 2023 and October 2024 to treat conditions such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. They also accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered under Medicare Part D, or about 14% of all costs, during that time period. “Last year, we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,” Xavier Becerra, the outgoing head of HHS, said in a statement. “Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.” The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed the CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. HHS in August announced lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. Read More: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Novo Nordisk (NVO), the company behind both Ozempic and Wegovy, had expected Ozempic to be included in the second round of price negotiations. Its drugs have become incredibly popular as Americans turn to GLP-1 medications to help them lose weight. Wegovy has also been approved for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes, while studies have found these dugs can help with several other conditions. Novo Nordisk saw its stock fall by more than 4% in pre-market trading Friday. Shares are also being affected by headline results from a new study that found patients who take a higher dose of Wegovy lost more weight than those on a lower dose without experiencing an increase in side effects. The study found that people who took a 7.2-milligram dose lost an average of 20.7% of their weight over 72 weeks. Patients who took a 2.4-milligram dose of the semaglutide lost 17.5% of their weight, while people given a placebo lost just 2.4% of their weight over that time. Over 33% of participants who took the higher dose also recorded a weight loss of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% of participants with the lower dose. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” Novo Nordisk’s head of development, Martin Holst Lange, said in a statement. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Too late, Larry Fink has the exclusive rights already. “Your archaic thought is irrelevant in the present” You’re right, the REAL COST of the Neocon disaster in Ukraine will be far more relevant in the future as the US finds that their only ‘friends’ are the economic basket cases in Europe.

Title: Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV): A Bear Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by SunderRei. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on SERV. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV)'s share was trading at $18.88 as of Jan 16th. Logistics robots filling packages in a warehouse, preparing for delivery. Serve Robotics (SERV) has captured significant attention with its autonomous delivery robots, yet the company’s financials raise major red flags. Despite a market valuation exceeding $1 billion, SERV's history of unprofitability, negative gross margins, and high operational costs suggests an unsustainable business model. Each robot currently costs more to produce and operate than the revenue it generates, undermining the company's long-term viability. Alarmingly, SERV plans to mass-produce 2,000 third-generation robots in 2025, a 20-fold increase from its existing fleet of 100. With production costs per robot exceeding $32,000, this initiative will exert enormous financial pressure on a company already struggling to demonstrate profitability. The revenue potential per robot is concerningly low. Based on SEC filings, second-generation robots generate an average of $7,612 annually in delivery revenue, which pales in comparison to their production cost of $63,654. Even with the reduced production costs of third-generation robots and projected improvements in efficiency, it would still take six years for a robot to recoup its manufacturing cost—well beyond the likely operational lifespan. Operational expenses, including remote control staffing (required 20% of the time) and maintenance, further erode profitability, with annual costs per robot conservatively estimated at over $18,000. Advertisement revenue, a secondary income stream, offers limited relief. Even with an optimistic projection of $800 per robot per month, total revenues remain insufficient to offset the heavy expenses. SERV’s reliance on NVIDIA as a strategic investor has driven speculative interest, particularly following NVIDIA’s $12 million investment and 10% ownership stake. However, NVIDIA’s involvement appears more focused on showcasing its AI hardware capabilities than on SERV’s financial success. NVIDIA’s endorsement has inflated SERV’s valuation, which skyrocketed 2,000% in mid-2024, but it fails to address the fundamental flaws in SERV’s business model. Looking ahead, SERV's planned expansion is likely to exacerbate financial losses, with ballooning costs far outpacing revenues. Recent insider sales totaling $3 million further signal declining confidence among management. While SERV remains a speculative play for optimists betting on autonomous delivery technology, its current valuation is disconnected from its financial reality. For investors, SERV presents an overvalued stock with significant downside risk, making it a compelling short opportunity as its financial struggles become increasingly apparent in future reports. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 5 hedge fund portfolios held SERV at the end of the third quarter which was 3 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SERV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: 'Drill, Baby, Drill,' Yet Time To 'Chill, Baby, Chill' on Lower Prices
URL: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/01/17/with_drill_baby_drill_you_may_need_to_chill_baby_chill_on_lower_prices_1085017.html

The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

January 17, 2025 07:11 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 17 January 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from STEP UP, a phase 3b trial in the global STEP programme. STEP UP is a 72-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once weekly. The trial included 1,407 randomised adults with obesity. All treatment arms were in conjunction with lifestyle intervention. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 72 with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 113 kg, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 20.7% after 72 weeks compared to a reduction of 17.5% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.4% with placebo. In addition, 33.2% of those who received semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a weight loss of 25% or more after 72 weeks, compared to 16.7% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 0.0% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 18.7% compared to a reduction of 15.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo. In the trial, semaglutide 7.2 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “Results from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy®, including cardiovascular risk reduction as seen in SELECT”. The results from the second semaglutide 7.2 mg phase 3 trial, STEP UP T2D, in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity are expected within the next few months. Detailed results from the STEP UP trial are expected to be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the STEP UP trialsNovo Nordisk has initiated two trials investigating the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2mg, STEP UP and STEP UP T2D. The 72-week STEP UP trial was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 1,407 adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and without diabetes were included in the trial. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. Key secondary endpoints included number of participants achieving 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% weight loss, respectively. The ongoing 72-week STEP UP T2D trial will investigate semaglutide 7.2 mg in 512 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with the primary objective to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg)Semaglutide 2.4 mg is marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. In the EU, Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition. In the EU, Wegovy® is also indicated for paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity) and body weight above 60 kg. The clinical section of the label also includes data showing the benefits of Wegovy® in reducing the risk of MACE, improving HFpEF-related symptoms and physical function, as well as reducing pain related to knee osteoarthritis. In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Title: The Power Of Leadership Magnetism: A Key Driver Of Stock Performance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2025/01/17/the-power-of-leadership-magnetism-a-key-driver-of-stock-performance/
Time Published: 2025-01-17T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Louis Carter: CEO of Best Practice Institute, creator of Most Loved Workplace®, author of Change Champions & In Great Company (McGraw Hill). When discussing drivers of stock performance, many factors come to mind—market conditions, financial performance and strategic communications, among others. However, even the most compelling good news doesn't always translate to stock price increases. A crucial yet often overlooked factor is what I call "leadership magnetism": the ability of a leader to build trust, emotional alignment and shared purpose with their stakeholders. Leadership magnetism refers to the gravitational pull a leader creates through their actions, behaviors and communications. It isn't about charisma or personality—it's about building authentic connections that attract, align and inspire stakeholders, from employees to investors. Leaders with strong magnetism can amplify the impact of strategic announcements, driving enthusiasm and financial returns. When leadership magnetism is weak, however, even breakthrough announcements can fail to move markets, as eroded trust dampens investor response. Research underscores the value of leadership magnetism in organizational success. A Weber Shandwick study found that executives attribute 44% of a company's market value to the CEO's reputation. Similarly, back in 2000, a Burson-Marsteller study revealed that 45% of a company's reputation directly stems from its CEO’s standing. These findings highlight how a leader’s ability to connect emotionally and strategically with stakeholders significantly influences market outcomes. Several notable cases demonstrate how weak leadership magnetism can undermine even the most promising strategic initiatives: • WeWork's Trajectory Under Adam Neumann: Despite announcing ambitious expansion plans in 2019, WeWork's valuation plummeted from $47 billion to less than $8 billion (subscription required). As documented by the Wall Street Journal, stakeholders lost confidence in Adam Neumann's leadership due to concerns about his decision-making and governance style. Bloomberg similarly detailed how mounting concerns about Neumann's transparency eroded investor confidence​ • Meta And Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse Investment: In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced a $10 billion investment in the metaverse alongside a company rebranding. However, Meta's stock price dropped, as ongoing privacy issues and ethical controversies diminished his leadership magnetism. • GE's Strategic Pivot Under Jeff Immelt: Between 2015 and 2017, GE's stock price declined from $30.66 to $23.16 as stakeholders questioned Jeff Immelt's ability to execute a digital transformation strategy. CEOs who master leadership magnetism can transform strategic announcements into powerful market catalysts: • Microsoft And Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella’s clear vision for AI-driven growth has been instrumental in Microsoft’s financial success. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft reported in 2024 "over $245 billion in annual revenue, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, alongside a 24% jump in operating income to over $109 billion." These achievements underscore Nadella’s ability to inspire confidence and effectively communicate strategic priorities. • Tesla And Elon Musk: Elon Musk’s ability to rally stakeholders around Tesla’s mission "to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy" exemplifies leadership magnetism. Musk’s authenticity and mission-driven strategy have been credited as key factors in Tesla’s rise to market dominance, inspiring investor confidence and stakeholder loyalty (membership required). After two and a half decades working alongside, coaching and advising CEOs, I've observed three fundamental practices that build and sustain leadership magnetism: Leadership magnetism thrives when leaders tune into their organization's pulse, strengthen it and then move on it. Magnetic leaders have an innate sense of when to listen and when to move—gathering key insights swiftly, recognizing patterns that matter and then driving consistent messages that reflect shared aspirations. Take Satya Nadella, whose leadership at Microsoft exemplifies this approach, bringing teams into the vision-building process and ensuring alignment and commitment. Magnetic leaders use stakeholder feedback as their strategic radar, not a compliance exercise. Lisa Su of AMD demonstrates this perfectly: She consistently gathers input from employees and retail investors, using it to refine AMD's strategy and foster loyalty. Elon Musk has a rare quality among CEOs: He doesn't sugarcoat things, even in tough moments. Take his 2014 interview where he opened up about Tesla's early days. Instead of spinning a success story, he admitted what was really going through his head at the time: "I thought we would most likely fail." You don't often hear billionaire founders talk about doubt like that. It's this kind of raw honesty, especially when the stakes are high, that sets his leadership style apart. Leadership magnetism is not a fixed trait—it’s a skill that can be cultivated through intentional practices. By fostering collaboration, integrating feedback and acting authentically, leaders can create a magnetic pull that inspires, aligns and drives success. As markets grow more complex and stakeholder expectations evolve, leadership magnetism will become increasingly crucial. Tomorrow's successful leaders must master the delicate balance between strategic vision and authentic connection, technical excellence and emotional intelligence, bold action and stakeholder trust. The revolution in leadership valuation is already underway. Good news alone won't drive stock price increases if stakeholders don't trust or admire the CEO. Those who embrace the power of leadership magnetism will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of market dynamics.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 3:49:27 AM PST by AbolishCSEU Governor Kathy Hochul announced that construction is underway at Town and Country Apartments, a 256-unit affordable housing complex in Binghamton. The $94 million rehabilitation project will modernize the 22-building garden-style development, fully electrify its infrastructure, and improve energy efficiency by 20%. The project is part of Hochul’s five-year, $25 billion Housing Plan, which aims to create or preserve 100,000 affordable homes across New York State, including 10,000 with support services for vulnerable populations. The initiative complements efforts by New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), which has financed over 1,260 affordable housing units in Broome County in the past five years. The apartments, reserved for households earning 60% or less of the area median income, will receive upgrades such as new flooring, windows, appliances, and electrical fixtures. Exterior renovations include roof replacements, concrete and asphalt repairs, updated landscaping, and environmental remediation. All units will be equipped with ENERGY STAR® appliances to promote sustainability. “This $94 million investment is preserving an important part of the Binghamton community while ensuring 256 households have an affordable, safe, and sustainable place to call home for years to come,” said HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. The development’s funding includes $70.9 million from HCR’s Multifamily Preservation Program and $16 million from the State Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Additional support includes a $3.2 million subsidy loan from HCR’s Clean Energy Initiative and $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding from the city of Binghamton.

Investing.com -- Citadel Securities, led by CEO Peng Zhao, has submitted an application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission to establish a brokerage in mainland China. The move comes as many Wall Street firms find it challenging to navigate the country's markets. The application was received by the regulator on Friday, as per the information on the regulator's website. Citadel Securities' decision to establish its own operation in China follows its unsuccessful attempt to acquire Credit Suisse's onshore business last year. In its efforts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in China, Citadel Securities had hired Tony Tang, the former China head of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., in September 2023. The US-based firm's move is somewhat unusual as many foreign financial institutions have been scaling back their operations in China. Despite this trend, Citadel Securities has been actively participating in China's A-share market from Hong Kong, where it trades cash equities, futures, options, and exchange-traded funds. The company maintains an office in Shanghai with a small team that supports its offshore China business. The new application signals an ambition to expand its presence within the mainland China market. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks

Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

Title: Microsoft’s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge

(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes The worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market.

Title: Zuckerberg, other moguls say they're backing off ESG and DEI but are they for real?

'Hannity' panelists Riley Gaines, Joe Concha and Leo Terrell give their take on DEI and the Trump transition team. Over the past 18 months, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda has suffered setbacks in corporate DEI programs, declining investment dollars, and the collapse of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. In just the last month, major banks withdrew from net-zero alliances and Meta dismantled many of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don’t be fooled. A closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke. (Adobe Stock) Dozens of Fortune 500 companies (including McDonald's and Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to jettison DEI in federal agencies. DEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT’S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG. These changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Even Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted. If you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you’ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman stated: "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." Citigroup was even more blunt: "we remain committed to reaching net zero." I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI Blackrock has been the most explicitly unrepentant. "[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion… and subjected us to legal inquiries… [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." Translation: "We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business." The moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s strategy of not using the term "ESG" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to "sustainability." Blackrock remains heavily invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects. That’s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends. NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY While superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG. Instead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from the incoming federal administration and from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date. But if ESG policy was distracting and destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies’ ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Banks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers. Most corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues. And as the American Airlines case shows, companies that fail to do so may very well be violating their fiduciary duty to clients and to shareholders.

Title: US President-Elect Donald Trump Said to Plan Elevation of Cryptocurrency as a National Priority

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Ewan Kennedy The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration, according to people familiar with the plans. The order is expected to name crypto as a national imperative or priority — strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also slated to create a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry's policy priorities, said the people who requested anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. Trump has enjoyed strong support from the crypto industry, which has a powerful presence in Washington, backed by well-funded political action committees. A slew of companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, have donated to Trump's inaugural committee in recent months. On Friday, days before the inauguration, the industry is hosting an “Inaugural Crypto Ball” in support of Trump. The executive order would mark a sea change for crypto, which has been a target for investigations during President Joe Biden's administration following a spate of high-profile fraud cases, including the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange. Federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission filed more than 100 enforcement actions against the sector in recent years, and banking regulators made it difficult for crypto companies to work with financial institutions. Still under discussion for inclusion in the executive order is a directive for all government agencies to review policies about digital assets and possibly pause any litigation involving crypto, the people said. Stopping legal actions that have targeted a range of companies from Binance Holdings Ltd., the world's biggest crypto exchange, to startup Ripple Labs Inc. is a top priority for the industry. Also under consideration is the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile, which would encompass the government's existing holdings of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, the people said. The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, confiscated as part of various investigations, according to analytics company Arkham. Bitcoin has rallied almost 50%, to above $100,000, since the November election in part on hopes that such a stockpile would be created. The token more than doubled in price in 2024. The people cautioned that the executive order, which could come as soon as Monday, is not final and could change before it is made public. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Trump has vowed to issue a bevy of executive orders across a range of disparate industries and issues within his first few days back in office. “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry,” said Kara Calvert, vice president for US policy at Coinbase Global Inc., the country's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. “What it's signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won't keep up.” Despite regulatory setbacks under Biden, crypto in the US expanded, with major financial companies including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., launching spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds last year. BNY has been working to expand its crypto custody effort, and Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to launch a Bitcoin financing business. Trump embraced the crypto industry during the presidential campaign last year. In July, he headlined a Bitcoin conference, where he promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump-branded collections of nonfungible tokens have been coming out for several years, and last year he and his sons announced a crypto effort called World Liberty Financial, which is supposed to let people earn and borrow crypto, but has yet to provide those services. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Bitcoin State Of Mind: Texas Aims To Pioneer Strategic Reserve

With President Donald Trump’s inauguration just a few days away, Bitcoin and blockchain supporters are bracing for crypto-friendly policies. Leading the charge is Texas, with Senator Charles Schwertner announcing a bill to launch its first state-level Bitcoin reserve. In a Twitter/X post, Senator Schwertner announced the filing of SB 778, making Texas the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to the Texan legislator, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve will position the state as a blockchain leader, drive economic growth, and secure everyone’s economic freedom. Texas is the 10th largest economy globally and has over $194 billion in general revenue that will fund the state’s operations from 2026 to 2027. In addition to its huge budget, the state has a growing Bitcoin and blockchain economy. It’s also home to several crypto mines, including the one in the city of Rockdale, which is acknowledged as the biggest Bitcoin mining operation in North America.

In addition to the proposal to start a reserve fund, SB 778 also outlines a recommendation to set up the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Advisory Committee. This committee shall include the House chairs for Appropriations and Finance, a comptroller, a member of the Senate and the House, among others. Although the general aim of establishing the state’s crypto reserve is to leverage the blockchain and use it as a hedge against inflation, SB 778 also outlines its specific purposes. According to Section 403.703, the state aims to hold BTC as a financial asset. The document also specifies that persons, including Texans, can donate Bitcoin to advance shared ownership and a sense of community. The document also highlights specific transactions that will not be allowed. For example, Section 403.705 indicates that the comptroller cannot approve transactions to buy BTC to be held in other countries. Although some questions and risks are associated with creating a reserve, many states are pushing forward. Aside from Texas, Oklahoma has shared its plans to hold the premiere digital currency as part of its currency reserves. Representative Cody Maynard filed HB 1203, the Strategic Reserve Act, which aims to allocate a portion of the state’s pension funds to buy these digital assets. Pennsylvania lawmakers also submitted their plans to invest in Bitcoin. The state’s policymakers suggest that the state’s Treasury allocate up to 10% of the funds to buy crypto. Representative Mike Cabell says the state can follow the lead of private financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock.

Layoffs: The United Kingdom's biggest asset manager Schroders Plc plans to layoff as much as 3 per cent of its workforce, or 200 jobs, as new Chief Executive Officer Richard Oldfield looks to revive growth, according to a Bloomberg report on January 17 citing sources. The source added that the layoffs would mostly be in technology and is one of the major changes being implemented by new CEO Oldfield, who took over from former and long-time chief Peter Harrison in November 2024, as per the report. “Our priority is to reposition the business at pace, as we transition to growth,” a spokesperson for the London-based firm said in a statement, Bloomberg added. As of June 30, the nearly 220-year-old Schroders managed around £774 billion ($947 billion) of assets. The job cuts will help it “improve delivery and ensure we are well-placed to meet our 2025 objectives, which are centered on reinforcing our active investment proposition,” the spokesperson added. Schroders' share price has sunk by around 50 per cent since its 2021 peak as it faced criticism for relatively high cost base and slower organic growth. The talk points also came amid wider woes facing traditional active fund managers as investors flock to lower-cost passive funds, the report noted. Other firms in the industry have trimmed their workforces in recent months, including Wellington Management and Manulife Financial Corp. Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc. told employees it’s cutting about 1 per cent of its over 21,000 employees. This means around 200 jobs are on the chopping block. “The cuts are part of BlackRock’s efforts to realign its resources with the firm’s strategy… As part of these firmwide efforts, we will be making changes today that will see approximately 1 per cent of our colleagues leave the firm… This is never easy,” BlackRock President Rob Kapito and COO Rob Goldstein told staff in a memo on January 8.

Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, welcome to the show. Amir Baluch: Hey, thanks for having me on. So I’ll start by briefly sharing my story and journey. Kevin Pho: Go right ahead. Amir Baluch: Well, it was kind of not the smoothest journey to get to where I am. So right now, I’m a semi-retired anesthesiologist and mainly focus on wealth strategies and alternative investments. But unlike most people listening to the show, I actually did not get into medical school the first time I applied. That was kind of painful. And so I decided to put my life savings in my first business, electronic payments. After about a year, that didn’t work either. So then I’m like, OK, what am I going to do? I guess I’ll move back in with my parents in Midland, Texas. My dad was an internal medicine doctor, so I figure, hey, they’ve got a spare bedroom for me. But two months later, he declared bankruptcy—clinic wasn’t doing well, some failed investments—and we actually ended up moving to a one-bedroom apartment, the whole family, and kind of started from scratch. So I was just sitting there thinking to myself: How do I prevent this, or where is the lack of financial education? I definitely didn’t get it in college or in high school. So, you know, I started learning a lot just from books and audio books as well. There weren’t really that many masterminds or anything like that. So Rich Dad Poor Dad was a book that was pretty popular around that time, like a quarter of a century ago, actually. And eventually I figured out that most people make their first million in real estate. So I started getting into real estate at the age of 21 while I reapplied. Eventually, I did get into medical school, thankfully, on the second attempt, but I kept going with those alternative investments in real estate. And eventually, when I was 25, I got into my first multifamily deal as an LP with a private REIT. In 2008, when I was a resident in Miami doing anesthesia, we did a short sale flip in Dallas. I eventually moved to Dallas in 2010–2011. I got my securities license because I love to learn. I joined a boutique investment bank. It had a broker-dealer arm and also a mergers and acquisitions arm. So I learned from them for about half a decade before I went off on my own to create Baluch Capital and help educate other physicians, so they wouldn’t end up like my family did, you know, 25 years ago, and also present some opportunities for growth and passive income. Kevin Pho: All right. So you’re an anesthesiologist, and of course, you have your focus on wealth building as well. What’s your life like between those two careers? Amir Baluch: Well, a few years ago, I went down to about doing 8 days a month of anesthesia. I took a year off to kind of formalize our company, make my brother systematize on the real estate development side, and brought in some underwriters from BlackRock, JP Morgan. Then I went back into anesthesia about 4 to 5 days a month. So, you know, every other Friday and maybe every other Tuesday, I’ll be in the OR, just picking up shifts or, you know, helping out friends if they’re on vacation—I’ll cover them. That way, I still have one foot in the game and get some free food every now and then, and don’t let my Figs scrubs go to waste that I spent so much money on, right? But most days, I’m waking up at 4 a.m. and I’m online with my team. We’re doing Zoom calls, we’re preparing for the day, and usually by 9 a.m. I’ve pretty much got a whole day’s worth of work done. The rest is pretty much the bonus round. We just work a lot on acquisition of real estate development, so we’re constantly working with underwriters and brokers and wholesalers. On the private equity side, we’re constantly in meetings with companies that we’ve already invested in. And a lot of times, I’m a strategic partner with them. So we’ve got to sit in on these quarterly meetings and help, you know, either if they need to pivot or need to scale up or wherever they are in their process. Then we also do acquisitions, buying out e-commerce stores and creating fixed income products for passive cash flow for people. So all that structuring, organization, and team building is usually the space that I live in. Kevin Pho: All right. So let’s talk about your KevinMD article, “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Tell us what this article is about for those who didn’t get a chance to read it. Amir Baluch: Well, you know, physicians are in such a unique space because they study for about 12 years, and they go into debt, which is kind of a disadvantage, but then they cash flow pretty significantly, and they usually have pretty good credit. So they have the cash flow, but they don’t have the time. So now, how can you use this to your own benefit? Well, you know what, whenever we become doctors, we kind of have a systematic approach for diagnosis and treatment, right? But a lot of times, we don’t apply that to investing. People kind of just shoot from the hip, but I think if doctors started applying that to their investments, they could actually diversify and create a systematic plan. “Hey, let me have a certain amount of private equity, a certain amount of private credit, a certain amount in real estate, a certain amount in the public stock markets,” and build a portfolio just as if they were trying to build a medical plan with somebody with multiple comorbidities. “Hey, we’ve got to treat your diabetes; we’ve got to treat your blood pressure; use this; use this.” You bring in specialists when you need them, right? You consult with other people when you get stuck. You don’t try to make a diagnosis or decide what the plan is on your own. So I think a lot of that mindset is actually embedded in the back of a doctor’s head, but sometimes they don’t use it because they’re so pressured with time, which is really their greatest asset. That’s the one that they really have to protect. So what I feel that a lot of physicians should do is, you know, if they have the strong cash flow and they can live a little bit below their means and start generating passive income, if you start focusing more on assets that create passive income instead of just focusing on net worth, you could buy your time back. For example, we’ve helped a lot of doctors just take one day off a week. Let’s say you can just take a Wednesday off, or maybe two afternoons—maybe Tuesday, Thursday afternoon. You can just work on your practice or work on something outside of medicine, like if you are going to go into real estate or you have another type of side hustle, just to kind of clear your mind. But it does help to get that extra maybe 5,000 to 10,000 dollars a month first, so you can back off a little bit and get a big perspective on what’s going on. Don’t miss out on the big picture, because when you’re working as a doctor—I don’t know how it was for you—but you’re just like, man, it’s work, work, work. It seems to never end. So I think that’s a good strategy that doctors can use to get their time back, which will help them make better investment decisions, maybe help grow their practice if they’re private practice. If you’re W-2, that’s a little bit different, but they could start building a second stream of revenue and kind of have some more control in life and also diversify from some of the pitfalls of medicine, which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, like decreasing reimbursement rates and a lot more corporate control and feeling the squeeze from these mergers. Kevin Pho: So you talk about alternative sources of income, passive sources of income. Normally, that tells me that this is real estate-based—that’s part of your background as well. So let’s say we’re a physician, or a physician is listening to you here, interested in hearing more. Tell us how they can get started. What are some examples of some of these passive income streams that you’re talking about? Amir Baluch: Well, I think that an easy one to get into is anything involving real estate, just because we’re a little bit more familiar with it. So I tried to get in with just doing a single-family rental. It’s kind of easy to get your mind wrapped around it, and it’s a business, but it’s very simple. The cash flow comes in from rent; your expenses are mainly the mortgage and maybe a little bit of upkeep. And that’s a pretty small business model but very easy to understand. And for a physician, it comes with a little bit of cash flow and some decent tax benefits. So you’re working on both offense and defense there. That’s a good place to go. The next probably would be private equity, which just means private business. So there’s public equity, like public stocks, and there’s private. It just happens that private equity has made more money than public equity every year for the last 35 years. So at some point, somebody should have some exposure to it. And physicians can team up and buy into these businesses. Even some mom-and-pop businesses, you could buy at maybe three to four times the net income of a business, which means your return is, you know, the inverse of that, which is 25 percent cash-on-cash return from day one. So imagine if you could buy into something that’s maybe medically related—maybe it’s an existing medical spa, which, you know, is a little bit medical, but maybe you might not have aesthetics involved in it. Or maybe it’s a joint venture with a pharmacy or something like that, that’s a little bit medically related but not what you’re trained to do. There’s actually good cash flow from there. And then, as they get older, it’s usually better. You know, then you’re trying to just protect what nest egg you’ve created, and you’re just looking for even more cash flow to bring your time back, and maybe something less risky. So usually private credit offers that, where it’s fixed debt against lending on a hard asset like real estate. Also, there are things like municipal bonds and corporate bonds. There are some public stocks that put off dividends, but it’s not that great. And then also just traditional fixed income products as well that you could get from either a financial advisor or even online. You could find those things where you could be a debt partner into a different type of entity. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the first thing you mentioned—single-family homes. How does one get started in that? You say that it’s a simple business, but let’s say a physician, like you said, is at a time deficit, may not know a lot about real estate. How does one learn enough to have the confidence to purchase a single-family home for passive income purposes? Amir Baluch: Well, there are a couple of ways. One, if somebody wanted to partner on the money side and the lending side and have somebody else kind of manage it from a distance, you could do that. And usually there are realtors out there that specialize in it. So how I got started—I got my real estate license in 2011. I don’t think anybody needs to do that. But even then, I worked with another realtor that specialized in single-family rentals. And so you can find these people online, and there are also these real estate meetups that you’re going to find in almost any city. So networking with people that are in that space is probably the first place to go. And whenever you find somebody there, as soon as you are collaborating with them, they’re going to open up their Rolodex. They’ve got people that lend on it, they’ve got people that find the properties, they’ve got people that manage the properties, because eventually you need some type of a team. If you’re wondering who those team players are, probably the best book you could get—now, I’ve actually just bought and given away copies of this; I wish it was my book—but it’s called The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller. It’s like a blue and white book on Amazon, probably 10 bucks or something like that. But they show you step by step on what team members you need to make this pretty smooth. And so, you know, once you start putting your team together and pull the trigger on your first one, and you get through a year or two of that first one, you kind of know, hey, what to look for, how to hire a proper property manager. And, you know, you rarely get any phone calls. So I think that’s the first thing to do: put together your team of a realtor that knows what they’re doing, get your lender—then the lender might have some contacts for you to help get you some deals too—and then a property manager. Kevin Pho: Now, contrast that option with, say, real estate syndications, because I hear a lot of physicians who may not want to make that effort in constructing their own team and directly purchasing a property, then go into real estate syndications. So contrast those two options. Amir Baluch: That’s a good topic. So the most important thing that a lot of people don’t talk about—the most important difference—is the valuation method. Most businesses, including a multifamily syndication or any commercial real estate syndication, the whole enterprise is valued at a certain multiple of the net income. Now, in commercial real estate, though, it just happens that instead of using a multiple of the net income or the multiple of EBITDA, you basically get the inverse of that, which is cap rate. And so cap rate is your, you know, if you bought a property all cash, what is your cash-on-cash return for a year? It’s usually like 4, 5, 6 percent, something like that. So that’s how those things are valued. So if you don’t increase the net income, if you don’t increase the rents, the value of that property is not going to go up. And you get a little bit of cash flow, but that value is really not going up that much. And sometimes it can go down, even if you increase rents, which is what’s happened in the last couple of years in multifamily. Now, if you contrast that with single-family, why does the value of the house go up? Well, it’s actually not the value, but the price of the house goes up because the value of the dollar goes down, and houses are always a good hedge against inflation. So houses will adjust for inflation, and the valuation is based off comps. So if your neighbor next door sold for a million bucks, and you’re right next to them, and you have about the same square footage, you’re probably going to sell for a million bucks. And it happens that, you know, all the components to make a house—wood, steel, labor, wages—that all goes up. So, you know, the replacement cost goes up, which makes these houses more valuable over time as well. So the valuation method is a little bit different, and you have to just go in there knowing what the plan is. So on a single-family, if you just buy and hold, and the cash flow is more than your monthly payment to the bank, you’re pretty much going to be OK no matter what, as long as you don’t get huge expenses coming in or too much vacancy. In commercial real estate, the difference is you’re going to be a lot more passive, so you can sit back and not do much work, but you’ve got to be careful about the valuations going in. You need to know a little bit more about how they’re going to increase those rents. In any commercial thing, it’s all about increasing the rents and decreasing expenses. You kind of have to have a better grasp of that and not just blindly invest in that, because if it’s not managed correctly, the overall property can go down in value—or maybe just not go up in value as much—compared to a single-family rental, which is pretty much always going to go up in value because it’s just hedging against inflation, sometimes a little bit better or oftentimes, in my opinion, better than commercial real estate. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the second option you mentioned, which is private equity. How do physicians dip their toes into that potential option? Amir Baluch: So this is a little bit trickier. You know, sometimes they’ve done it and didn’t even know that they’re in it. For example, a lot of my surgery buddies are partners in a surgery center—that’s technically private equity. Or maybe if somebody opened up or partnered on a coffee shop down the street or anything that’s a private business, they might be in it but not thinking that it’s private equity, but it is, just on a very small scale. A lot of times when people think private equity, they think of businesses that are, you know, 10 million, 50 million, maybe even a few billion dollars. That one, at least for me, is just a lot of networking. Luckily, because of my securities license, I was networked with a bunch of broker-dealers, and we just get deals all the time. Most of these things involve issuing securities in the private market. And so through them, I’ve gotten a lot of deal flow in at least life sciences and biotech. But if somebody wants to get into private equity, you really have to go out there and basically take action and look for it. So you could go find some business brokers. For example, let’s say I really wanted to get into a pharmacy, because as an anesthesiologist, I just liked the pharmacology, right? And maybe I just wanted a pharmacy. You could find business brokers that are selling it and get on those email lists and say, “Hey, I’m looking for this. I can get an SBA loan for about a million, so I have this much down payment. If you find somebody that’s willing to owner-finance, I could do that.” And you actually go out there and have to hunt. It’s way easier to do public equity, right? You just push a button online and buy stocks. But the downside of that is those are very efficient markets, and in an efficient market, it’s hard to get good risk-adjusted returns. In the private market, there’s a lot more inefficiencies. You have to deal with brokers, and the deals take a long time to close. It’s not like if somebody puts a Twitter post online that the valuation changes in milliseconds or anything like that. So it’s a little bit more work but a lot more stable. Over time, the data has shown it’s more profitable and higher risk-adjusted returns. Kevin Pho: Now, is there a certain type of physician personality trait who would be more amenable to these alternative investments versus just sticking with low-cost index funds? Because from what I’m hearing, not all physicians may be cut out for these alternative investments that you’re talking about. Amir Baluch: Right. I think, you know, at the end of the day, you can make it through either path. I’d say if you are going to do a set-it-and-forget-it with index funds, you’re going to have to save a lot more and have a longer timeline. Right now, I mean, these people—nobody has a crystal ball—but JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are predicting that the next 10 years, the S&P and indices should be averaging around 3 percent, 2 to 3 percent a year returns after adjusting for inflation because of the bull run we’ve had and P/E ratios, you know, two standard deviations above where they usually are, and things like that. So if you just have a longer timeline, you could set it and forget it if you don’t want to spend the time to learn about alternatives or if you don’t have the network to find some mentors that could help guide you. Now, if somebody has more time on hand and wants to diversify—which I think diversification is really key because you can never put all your eggs in one basket, right? So if somebody wants to diversify, it is a little bit more active. Even if you end up being a limited partner in some type of alternative syndication, there’s still some active role in there. You need to do some minimal due diligence. And if anybody has questions about that, they could email me on an asset class. I’ll at least show, you know, 20 or 30 things you should look at in every asset class before you pull the trigger. But you do have to take a little bit more active role or maybe put together a small investment group where everybody is putting in their two cents and dividing up the work and pooling their money together to invest as a group. That’s another way to do it if people are constrained for time. But for sure, people that have more time, which in my experience has been anesthesiologists and emergency doctors—it’s more like shift-work-oriented—or even hospitalists that are one week on, one week off, are now really getting into alternatives and having the time to do the due diligence on these deals and increase their deal flow. Because it just depends on your time, the time involvement you want to take, and your timeline. If you can look further out and save more money, you could go with the indices route—just a little bit more risk. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Amir Baluch. He’s an anesthesiologist. Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, let’s end with some take-home messages that you want to leave with the KevinMD audience. Amir Baluch: You know, in anything you want to accomplish in life, if you work hard enough and you’re around the right people, you’re going to get it. So if being financially savvy or getting enough passive income so you can maybe just take one or two days off—not really retire early, because I think if you like your job, you should keep doing it—but, you know, you want to just find some mentors out there, read as much as you can, and hang around people who have been there, done that, that pretty much already are where you want to be. And if anybody wants any other resources, we’ll have a link for anybody watching where they can get a free copy of my book, Prosperity Prescription. It has a little bit of a blueprint on how to get that started. Or if somebody wants to book a quick 10-minute call with me—just like a clarity call, I call it—where in 10 minutes, we kind of find out what the next step would be for them. Those two options will be available somewhere on a link, either on my website or somewhere after this podcast. Kevin Pho: Amir, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight.

Samara Cohen, the firm's ETF and index instruments chief investment officer, thinks cryptocurrency deregulation will "absolutely" propel bitcoin to another historic year. "There will be progress made on… FIT21 ["Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stable coins. There will be progress made just on definitions in taxonomy," she told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. Cohen is behind the firm's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which is up 114% since its January 2024 debut and up almost 8% year to date. It comes as bitcoin briefly traded above $100,000 this week. Despite the strong performance, she suggests cryptocurrency investors need an iron stomach. "Bitcoin is a risky asset. So, 15% in the context of Bitcoin is not an enormous move. Investors should expect volatility," said Cohen. "But in the long term, the price of bitcoin is really going to be determined by the level and pace of adoption." On Monday, BlackRock announced the official launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF on CBOE Canada. And, it's not the only firm making an early year push deeper into cryptocurrency. Calamos Investments plans to launch its Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF next Wednesday – two days after Trump's inauguration. According to the press release, it's the "world's first 100% downside protected bitcoin ETF." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Research released by New York Digital Investment Group shows that in Q4 2024, Bitcoin broke away from major assets following the election of Donald Trump in November—but it could still move back in line with them. Bitcoin has often moved in line with U.S. equities—particularly tech stocks—as it is considered by many to be a “risk-on” asset. It has also typically done well in a low-interest rate environment. Bitcoin ETFs registered $16.5B of net inflows, but the lion’s share of flows is going to BlackRock and Fidelity while some ETFs registered outflows during the quarter. pic.twitter.com/Z1Kz1Z7GkW — NYDIG (@NYDIG) January 13, 2025 “With Bitcoin increasingly owned by traditional market investors, it’s natural to expect correlations to change,” the NYDIG report read, referring to the new Bitcoin ETFs trading on stock exchanges. “Still, the promise of a non-sovereign issued store of value is an appealing investment in the current geopolitical climate, one that should not be driven by the same macroeconomic levers of say the U.S. stock market,” it added. Bitcoin surged to new highs after President-elect Trump’s November 5 victory. The incoming leader campaigned on a promise to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry, and NYDIG credits Trump's win as the "main driver" for Bitcoin's surge. By December 17, the biggest digital coin had hit a new all-time of $108,135, CoinGecko data shows. It has since retreated and is now trading for $99,600. Earlier this week, it briefly dipped below the $90,000 mark before a resurgence back above $100,000. NYDIG added in its research that Bitcoin outperformed all asset classes by a wide margin in 2024, rising by more than 47% in the final quarter, and by nearly 120% from January to the end of the year. The biggest cryptocurrency has in the past moved both with the stock market and gold. Is it slowly becoming an asset class of its own?

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: UnitedHealth Stock Ails as Results Fall Short

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked lower on Thursday, failing to gain ground a day after soft inflation data and an upbeat start to earnings season helped drive a strong rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, ending a streak of three straight positive trading sessions. The Dow was also down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares dropped 6.0%, posting the heaviest daily loss in the S&P 500, following the healthcare giant's first earnings release since last month's fatal shooting of insurance unit chief Brian Thompson. Although quarterly profits came in ahead of expectations, UnitedHealth reported lower-than-expected revenue. An increase in medical costs also contributed to a year-over-year uptick in the firm's medical cost ratio, which compares medical expenses to total revenue. Shares of US Bancorp (USB) plunged 5.6%. The move lower came after the financial services firm reported mixed quarterly results, topping adjusted profit estimates but falling short of forecasts for its net interest margin, a key measure of a bank's effectiveness in lending its capital. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares sank 5.1% after reports that China's Commerce Ministry is launching an investigation into the legality of U.S. subsidies for chipmakers that create competitive challenges for Chinese products. With a focus on lower-end semiconductors like power and analog chips, Texas Instruments could face repercussions if Chinese officials determine the company has violated anti-dumping regulations. Shares of Dexcom (DXCM), a manufacturer of glucose-monitoring devices for patients with diabetes, gained the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, jumping 5.5%. Analysts at Piper Sandler highlighted several bullish catalysts for Dexcom, including a stable outlook for its durable medical equipment (DME) channel and the approval of reimbursement for 5 million patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. In addition, Baird analysts boosted their price target on Dexcom stock, noting improvements in salesforce productivity and growth potential in U.S. markets. JPMorgan boosted its price target on Estee Lauder (EL) stock, and shares of the makeup and skin-care specialist jumped 4.8%. Analysts said they expect this earnings season to be consequential for makers of household and personal-care products, with discussions about consumer behaviors, tariff risks, currency impacts, and interest-rate expectations likely to influence the 2025 industry outlook. Semiconductor equipment stocks advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), issued strong fourth-quarter profit guidance. The world's largest contract chipmaker highlighted an upbeat outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, which bodes well for sales of chip manufacturing gear, even as the Netherlands announced tightened export rules that could affect the industry. Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp. (KLAC), and Lam Research (LRCX) shares gained 4.5%, 4.3%, and 4.0%, respectively.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, an LA Native, Weighs In on Wildfire’s Impact on Insurance

The ongoing Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed or damaged some 12,000 structures, incinerated entire neighborhoods and wiped out businesses and landmarks alike. The extensive damage, which took place in less than ten days, could take up to ten years to repair, according to Larry Fink, CEO and chairman of BlackRock (BLK), which manages enormous assets for insurance companies affected by the natural disaster.

You can opt out anytime. “When you have whole neighborhoods destroyed and you have infrastructure and schools and supermarkets destroyed, this is not a one-year fix,” said Fink yesterday (Jan. 15) in an interview with CNBC. “This is going to be five, six, seven, maybe ten years of fixing.” Overseeing some $11.6 trillion, BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and houses around $700 billion managed for insurance companies. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call yesterday, Fink pointed to insurance as “one of the primary areas of growth for us.” The sheer amount of damage wrought by the Los Angeles fires will make homeowners insurance an increasingly pertinent topic in the U.S. going forward, Fink said. The devastating event is also a personal one for the BlackRock executive, who is a Los Angeles native. Hiking the Santa Monica Mountains, where one of the ongoing wildfires broke out, was “one of my pleasures of growing up, looking for snakes and reptiles as a kid, walking through the chaparral,” he said, recalling living in Los Angeles during the great Bel Air Fire of 1961. “We’ve always had fires in Los Angeles, but we’ve never seen destruction like this.” The ongoing wildfires have killed at least 25 people and brought unprecedented economic damage. Losses for the insurance industry could climb as high as $40 billion, according to analysts from Keefe Bruyette & Woods, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have estimated $30 billion in costs to insurers. These numbers surpass the $12.5 million in losses from California’s 2018 Camp Fire—the largest insured wildfire loss to date. The sheer amount of destroyed homes—many of which were in well-to-do neighborhoods like the Pacific Palisades or Altadena, which Zillow estimates have average home values of $3.5 million and $1.2 million respectively—will shine a spotlight on the role of homeowners insurance across America, according to Fink. In recent years and months, numerous insurance companies have withdrawn coverage from wildfire-prone areas in California. Los Angeles County, for example, has reportedly seen 531,000 homeowner policies canceled between 2020 and 2022. The pullback has forced many California residents to turn to the California FAIR plan, the state’s last-resort insurance program. The FAIR plan’s total exposure as of September was $448 billion—a 61 percent increase year-over-year and a 123 percent jump compared to 2020. Besides potentially spurring a redefinition of event risk throughout the U.S., the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires means homeowners insurance will become a key topic for governments going forward, Fink told CNBC. “This is going to be one of the bigger issues that we’re going to have to be tackling over the next four years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Litecoin ETF Could Attract Up to $580M of Inflows If Adoption Mirrors That of Bitcoin ETFs

Time Published: 2025-01-16T21:33:47Z
Full Content:
While a litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund is still only theoretical, investor demand for the product could soar as high as $580 million if Wall Street adopts it at the same rate it did LTC’s better-known cousin bitcoin. That calculation is based on the roughly 6% of bitcoin’s total supply now locked up in a variety of ETFs. Similar performance by a LTC product would yield more than $500 million of inflows for the token, which has a similar Proof of Work consensus mechanism to that of BTC. These possibilities came into focus Thursday as market participants began sizing up the likelihood that LTC might become the third crypto asset to get its own ETF in the U.S., after BTC and ETH. Canary Capital, a new digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is best positioned to issue such a product. It got the ball rolling on a litecoin ETF in October. On Thursday, Nasdaq stock exchange filed a 19b-4 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission, officially putting the regulator on the clock to make a decision. Bloomberg’s Balchunas expects LTC to garner SEC approval given industry chatter he said he’s been hearing. Litecoin’s similar tech specs to bitcoin may also prove a factor, assuming their reliance on proof of work consensus mechanism spell better likelihood of being considered a commodity. The question is whether there is enough investor demand to make a litecoin fund a success or not. “Even if demand is comparatively low, it could still see some demand,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Just because the success won’t be as crazy as the bitcoin or even the ethereum ETFs doesn’t mean that it can’t be successful. The market and investors will make that determination.” The bitcoin ETFs set unprecedented records in their first year of trading, with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) becoming the most successful launch in the history of U.S. ETF launches. “The key question here remains the uncertainty of investor demand for additional products and whether new crypto ETP launches will matter,” JPM analyst Kenneth B. Worthington wrote in a note on Monday. Worthington believes that tokens beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana oftentimes lack depth as they “may capture incremental attention for a limited time.” About 6% of bitcoin total market capitalization, which stands at a whopping $1.97 trillion, is locked up in the ETFs, according to a report by JPMorgan earlier this week. In comparison, the ethereum (ETH) ETFs comprise about 3% of ether’s $401 billion market cap. He used this so-called “adoption rate” to determine how much inflows the proposed XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) ETFs could attract which Worthington concluded could add up to a combined AUM of up to $14 billion. When applying this calculation to Litecoin, which stands at a $9.6 billion market cap, Canary Capital’s fund could attract anywhere between $290 to $580 million in the first year of trading, depending on how well investors will adopt the fund. While $290 million seems disappointing compared to the $108 billion that the spot bitcoin ETFs have gathered or the $12 billion that the ether ETFs currently hold, it is a larger amount than most ETFs in the U.S. handle. According to Seyffart, only about 1,330 out of roughly 4,000 ETFs in the U.S. have an AUM greater than $300 million.

Title: GFL Environmental’s (GFL) $6 Billion Stake Sale – Here’s Why Jim Cramer Thinks It’s a Smart Move

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is watching. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently highlighted a surge in merger activity, pointing out that we’ve seen a significant uptick in deals over the past few days. He explained that this wave of mergers and acquisitions aligns with what he’s been predicting, a shift in M&A activity due to the change in administration. Cramer noted that under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department’s antitrust division have been very strict on mergers, often taking an aggressive stance against any form of corporate consolidation. According to Cramer, companies had grown increasingly reluctant to pursue mergers under Biden’s regulatory approach, as they faced the uncertainty of lengthy court battles with little assurance of success. “And that’s why when Trump won in November, it became very obvious that we were looking at a deluge of M&A deals and these companies couldn’t even bring themselves to wait for inauguration day.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 12 Stocks in Focus This Week and 7 Consumer Goods and Retail Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar “Alright, so what do we make of this wave of deals? First, I gotta say, it’s just nice to see some mergers again and while this deluge was widely anticipated because of the change in administrations, it’s still good to see some confirmation.” Cramer said it made him more confident in predicting that M&A deals will continue to increase, which is one reason why he recently added Goldman Sachs stock to his Charitable Trust portfolio as it has a major M&A advisory business that had been relatively dormant under the previous administration. He urged investors to consider buying the stock, noting that it’s an excellent opportunity. More generally, Cramer expressed satisfaction in seeing so many companies once again pursuing mergers that make sense for their businesses. When examining the deals announced in early January, Cramer pointed out that while some of these deals might have faced challenges under Biden’s administration, most appear justifiable. “So the bottom line: Gotta tell you, I’m just glad we’re back to a place where reasonable arguments like this will be considered fairly by the antitrust regulators rather than the situation we had under Biden where every takeover is considered anti-competitive until proven otherwise. For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 8. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An excavator at a landfill site operating amidst a pile of solid waste. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Cramer mentioned GFL Environmental Inc.’s (NYSE:GFL) sale of its majority stake in its Environmental Services business. “Yesterday, a waste management company called GFL Environmental announced that it’s selling the majority of its environmental services business to a pair of private equity firms for over $6 billion… Looking at the transactions we’ve seen just this week, while some of them likely would’ve been challenged by Biden’s ideologically driven regulators, most of them seem pretty justifiable. All of them make great business sense.” GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) provides non-hazardous solid waste management and environmental services in Canada and the United States, including collection, transportation, recycling, disposal, liquid waste management, and soil remediation. Recently, it announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Environmental Services business for an enterprise value of $8.0 billion. As part of the deal, the company will retain a $1.7 billion equity interest in the business and expects to receive approximately $6.2 billion in cash proceeds after accounting for the retained equity and taxes. As per Reuters, the transaction follows months of pressure from activist group ADW Capital Management, which had urged GFL to divest its environmental solutions business and focus solely on waste management. The company plans to use up to $3.75 billion of the net proceeds from the deal to reduce debt, with up to $2.25 billion allocated for share repurchases. Following the debt repayment, it expects its net leverage to stand at 3.0x. CEO Patrick Dovigi stated that the transaction will significantly strengthen the company’s balance sheet, moving it closer to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. Additionally, GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) has the option to repurchase the Environmental Services business within five years of the deal’s expected close in the first quarter of 2025, which will also lead to a reduction in its cash interest expenses by approximately C$200 million. Overall, GFL ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is watching.

The core retail business, which Amazon also refers to as its stores division, encompasses a wide range of divisions, including its private label brands, Prime membership program, and consumables business. "We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition." The layoffs included employees in the fashion and fitness business, among others, the spokesperson said. Business Insider earlier reported on the job cuts. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has moved to rein in costs across the company, laying off about 27,000 employees since the beginning of 2022. The bulk of the job cuts came in 2022 and 2023, though they have been ongoing at a smaller scale, and have impacted almost every business across the company's portfolio. Amazon has also shuttered some of its more experimental and unprofitable initiatives, including its telehealth offering, a brick-and-mortar delivery program, and try-on service for clothing and shoes.

Title: Trump will keep TikTok from ‘going dark’, adviser says
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/16/trump-will-keep-tiktok-from-going-dark-adviser-says
Time Published: 2025-01-16T20:08:37Z

TikTok is planning to shut its app in the US on Sunday when a ban kicks in. United States President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser has said the new administration will keep TikTok alive in the US if there is a viable deal. “We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,” US Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News on Thursday. He noted that the law gives authority for a 90-day extension for the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to complete a divestiture. This is the case, said Waltz, “as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday that TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, should be given more time to find a buyer. “It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said, adding that Senate Democrats tried to pass a bill to extend the deadline to come up with a solution. “I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security.” TikTok is used by more than 170 million Americans monthly. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. A group of US lawmakers is also pushing for a 270-day extension as well, warning that a ban could hurt Americans who make a living from using TikTok. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, “President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there’s no better dealmaker than Donald Trump.” Reuters has previously reported that TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that outgoing President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the US Supreme Court fails to act. The official added that Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, but the law also bars US companies from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it once any ban begins. The president can issue a one-time, 90-day delay to the ban if he certifies to Congress that there has been evidence of significant progress and there are binding legal agreements in place to allow a complete divestiture in three months. Separately, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration on January 20 and sit among high-profile guests invited by Trump, a source told Reuters. Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, criticised the decision to invite Chew on social media platform X. “Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok—just like many Republicans voted to do,” Pallone said. “But now he’s inviting TikTok’s CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?” The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: 'Deeply Alarmed': Read the Letter WaPo Employees Sent to Jeff Bezos Demanding He Address Newsroom
URL: https://freebeacon.com/media/deeply-alarmed-read-the-letter-wapo-employees-sent-to-jeff-bezos-demanding-he-address-newsroom/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T20:00:59Z
Full Content:
The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, congressional bureau chief, and lead fact-checker were among the signatories of a letter to owner Jeff Bezos complaining about the paper’s current leadership and pressing him to come to the newsroom for a sit-down with newsroom leaders, according to a copy of the document obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The letter—a broadside against the paper’s leadership under publisher Will Lewis, whose push for political moderation has rankled many of the Post’s left-leaning employees—was first reported by NPR on Wednesday. But the names of the staffers who signed it have not previously been reported. Among the 432 signatories are White House Bureau Chief Toluse Olorunnipa, Congressional Bureau Chief Paul Kane, Senior Politics and Democracy Editor Griff Witte, and fact-checking columnist Glenn Kessler. Other prominent names include left-leaning columnists David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Karen Attiah, and Dana Milbank. The letter was also signed by the Post’s chief political correspondent Dan Balz, MAGA correspondent Isaac Arnsdorf, and White House reporter Yasmeen Abutaleb. The Post’s abortion correspondent Caroline Kitchener, Upper Midwest Democracy reporter Patrick Marley, and Climate Zeitgeist reporter Shannon Osaka signed the petition as well. The list of signers shows the growing discontent at the Post, which lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after declining to endorse Kamala Harris in November. The paper also drew criticism from employees this month after scrapping a cartoon that took aim at owner Bezos. The petition—sent to Bezos on Tuesday—was circulated around the newsroom this week for signatures, along with an addendum note that said it was written by a "small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. The addendum urged employees to "sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support)" and added: "Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post." In the letter to Bezos, employees said they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. Staffers said their concerns go "far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative." The letter urged Bezos to "come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in." A number of staffers have recently left the paper, including anti-Trump opinion writer Jen Rubin, while employees are reportedly bracing for a major round of layoffs. The Post has faced internal turmoil for months, with many staffers blaming Bezos and Lewis for the paper’s shift away from anti-Trump political activism. In October, the Free Beacon obtained audio from a tense meeting of the Post’s editorial team, where some of the writers bemoaned the paper’s decision to not publish a presidential endorsement and accused Bezos of political meddling and financial conflicts of interest. Just two days after the letter went to Bezos, on Thursday, the New York Times reported on a "new mission statement" at the Post meant to reflect "a more expansive view of The Post's journalism": "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The Post, however, will not be ditching its more infamous slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness." The letter sent to Bezos and its signatories can be read in full below: Letter to Jeff Bezos Dear colleagues: We have drafted a letter to our owner, and we are seeking your support. The following letter was written by a small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom. This is a collective action of employees and managers, both Guild-covered and not. So far, more than 420 of you have signed your names. We sent this letter directly to Jeff Bezos on Tuesday evening but will continue to collect signatures and add names to this form. We urge you to sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support). Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post. Note that small changes have been made from earlier versions. Let's fight for the paper we love. *** To Jeff Bezos: You recently wrote that ensuring the long-term success and editorial independence of this newspaper is essential. We agree, and we believe you take as much pride in The Washington Post as we do. We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent. This goes far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative. This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication. We urge you to come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in. We are committed to pursuing independent journalism that holds power to account and to reporting the news without fear or favor. That will never change. Nothing will shake our determination to follow the reporting wherever it leads. As you wrote when you first became The Post’s owner in 2013, "The values of The Post do not need changing." We urge you to stand with us in reaffirming those values.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement. The Price Action of TSM Stock In the last month, the shares have advanced 11.5%, while they are up 5.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

More Info Italy’s biggest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made history by becoming the first Italian financial institution to buy 11 bitcoins for a "test" purchase worth $1 million. Initially a widespread rumor, Bloomberg has confirmed that Italy’s largest banking giant has indeed dipped its toes in Bitcoin. According to an internal memo, the financial institution completed its first proprietary Bitcoin trade, investing the funds into the world’s largest digital currency. “It’s very small amounts, considering we have 100 billion euros in our securities portfolio,” Intesa CEO Carlo Messina told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Milan on Tuesday. “It’s an experiment, a test.” Intesa set up a proprietary trading desk for digital assets in 2023 and started handling spot trades with cryptos last year. The news first surfaced when the bank’s employees leaked an internal email on the image-sharing platform 4Chan. Following the leak, Niccolo Bardoscia, Intesa Sanpaolo’s head of digital assets trading and investment, officially confirmed the acquisition in an email to the media, revealing that the bank now holds 11 BTC. While Bardoscia confirmed the purchase, the executive did not reveal exactly why the bank had acquired BTC. Therefore, it is still unclear if the purchase was to diversify Intesa Sanpaolo’s investment portfolio or if it was a pilot to offer crypto services, according to CryptoRank. The acquisition is not the bank’s first foray into blockchain. In July last year, Intesa Sanpaolo pioneered a $25.7 million digital bond issuance on the Polygon network in collaboration with state-owned bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo broadened its crypto desk to allow spot trading. Before then, it only offered clients crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase came as Europe eased regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory guideline came into full effect in December, a milestone that’s expected to pave the way for more digital-asset adoption among financial companies. While Intesa is currently only prop trading — buying and selling using its own balance sheet rather than on behalf of clients — the crypto desk’s activities fit with the bank’s broader blockchain projects, and it may be a stepping stone for eventually trading digital assets for institutional customers. “We won’t become a Bitcoin provider but we need to know how to do so if our bigger clients ask us to,” Messina told reporters on Tuesday. Intesa carried out the Bitcoin purchase through Boerse Stuttgart Digital’s institutional trading platform, a spokesperson from the German exchange group said in a statement. After rallying in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win in early November, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have had a shaky start to the year, hurt by concerns that persistent inflation will curtail the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy easing. Bitcoin briefly slid below $90,000 on Monday — a drop of almost 5% from the start of 2025 — before a rebound that left it slightly up for January. The largest cryptocurrency soared to a record high of $108,316 last month. This BTC acquisition signals a shift in sentiment within Italy. As the country’s largest bank leads the way, other financial institutions may follow suit, potentially accelerating adoption. The move stands out in Italy, where the central bank governor, Fabio Panetta, has consistently cautioned against digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, describing them as “unsecured.” That said, the bank has a long way to go to catch up with its US peers: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has amassed $51 billion in assets in the spot Bitcoin ETF it launched a year ago, and is pushing to have its money-market digital coin more widely used as collateral for crypto derivatives trades. JPMorgan is preparing to offer instant settlement for foreign-exchange conversions between the dollar and the euro through its blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value continues to surge, with optimism growing about easing regulatory hurdles under incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Some analysts expect it to more than double in value by the end of this year.

Title: Is Applied Materials (AMAT) the Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. The NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends. NASDAQ’s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market. READ ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett’s 10 Cheap Stock Picks Tech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won’t undermine the companies’ future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst: “I don’t view it as a problem. I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They’ve won on the business-model side, and they’re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.” Overall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a global leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, supplying critical tools for creating advanced chips used in AI, data centers, automotive technology, and other sectors. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to more than double by 2032, with Applied Materials likely to be a major beneficiary of this growth. Beyond just selling its equipment, the company has seen a significant boost in revenue from its equipment servicing segment. As manufacturing equipment becomes more complex and specialized, the demand for expert maintenance continues to rise, contributing to this fast-growing part of the business. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported revenue of $7.05 billion, which showed a 5% growth from the same period last year. The company’s net income for the quarter came in at $1.73 billion. Its diverse range of products and services strategically positions the company to support its customers in advancing AI and energy-efficient computing. As these critical areas of semiconductor innovation gain prominence, the industry’s progress increasingly relies on materials engineering, a field where Applied Materials holds a leading position. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) also showed a strong cash position in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $8.68 billion during the year. Its free cash flow amounted to $7.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned approximately $5.01 billion to shareholders, including $1.19 billion in dividends. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for seven consecutive years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.89%, as of January 15. Vltava Fund highlighted Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its recently published Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 74 funds held stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 77 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.6 billion. Overall, AMAT ranks 6th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Hola Prime Is Changing The Future Of Prop Trading
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hola-prime/2025/01/16/how-hola-prime-is-changing-the-future-of-prop-trading/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T17:39:08Z

For decades, proprietary trading firms have been cloaked in opacity, leaving traders in the dark about critical processes like pricing, risk management, and payouts. Hola Prime is challenging the status quo. With users across 175+ countries and a suite of innovative features, the firm is redefining the future of prop trading by prioritizing transparency and creating an ecosystem tailored to the needs of modern traders. In prop trading, traders can showcase their skills without risking their own capital. They begin by participating in a firm’s challenge, trading in a demo environment to meet profit targets while staying within risk limits. Once they succeed, traders gain access to a “Funded Account,” where they trade with the firm’s capital and share the profits. Traders just pay a small fee, while the prop firm provides the platform. The firm’s business model revolves around identifying disciplined traders and mirroring their trades. By scaling up the trade volume, the firm can double the potential profit, benefiting both the trader and the firm. Hola Prime is transforming the prop trading industry by creating a transparent and trader-focused ecosystem that sets new benchmarks in the prop trading industry. Leading Hola Prime is Mr. Somesh Kapuria, the firm’s Managing Director and CEO, whose extensive experience in Forex and securities spans decades. A former senior executive at Citibank, New York, and Blackrock, Mr. Kapuria consistently drove revenue growth and spearheaded innovations widely adopted by Wall Street asset managers. “When we launched Hola Prime, it wasn’t about starting just another prop trading firm,” Mr. Kapuria shares. “It was about giving traders a fair shot, free from hidden costs and confusing practices. We’re not just fixing problems; we’re reshaping the future of trading. When traders win fairly, we win too.” Prop trading is not a regulated industry, as of today. But Hola Prime has taken a proactive approach by establishing a dedicated Risk and Compliance Department. This is unheard of in the industry. The purpose of this Department is to ensure that the internal policies at Hola Prime are as robust as they can be, and are always complied with. This Department ensures that there are Daily Accounts Reconciliations, payouts are always accurate and available for processing, and there are always additional funds available for cushion. It also ensures strong KYC and AML implementation, seamless Order flow management into live markets, along with effective management of the firm's market risk, at all times. This approach helps in building a sustainable business with a solid foundation, and builds deep trust with the customers. Prop trading has historically faced criticism for its lack of clarity, especially in pricing and execution. Traders often question whether they’re being treated fairly, but finding answers has been difficult. This absence of transparency erodes trust and causes trust deficit. Recognizing this gap, Hola Prime stepped up with an innovative solution - the Price Transparency Report. By providing traders with tick-by-tick data compared against market benchmarks, Hola Prime empowers them to verify the integrity of pricing and execution. “We are proud to be the first and the only prop firm to publish a Price Transparency Report,” says Mr. Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Risk and Compliance at Hola Prime. “This report is just as crucial for us as it is for our traders, as it guarantees that our liquidity providers offer prices that are in line with the market, fostering accountability at every level,” he adds. “We share this report with all active traders, and we’re proud to report a 99.63% match rate between our data and leading market benchmarks,” Mr. Ashutosh continued. “With over 10 million price ticks analyzed every month, we ensure that our pricing accuracy and transparency remains unmatched in the industry.” Unlike many competitors, Hola Prime was designed by traders who have experienced the pain points of traditional prop trading firsthand. This insider perspective has enabled the firm to create solutions that directly address these challenges - from delayed payouts to insufficient risk management tools. Mr. Somesh Kapuria, Managing Director and CEO, Hola Prime “Our mission is simple - to eliminate uncertainty for traders and empower them to focus on strategy and execution,” says Mr Somesh Kapuria. “Every feature we’ve developed is rooted in feedback from our global trading community” he adds. Payout delays have long been a sore spot for prop traders. Hola Prime tackles this head-on with its industry-leading 1-hour payout system, with over 99% success rate. For traders, this means no more waiting days to access their hard-earned profits. “We follow a 10-point payout system and complete our calculations at the end of each day to ensure payouts are ready promptly,” says Ms. Sumedha, CFO at Hola Prime. “Our average payout time is just 45 minutes. Our partnerships with PSPs, including Paypal, Rise and some crypto PSPs, are integral. These PSPs offer fast and reliable transfers, enabling quick multi-currency and multi-network payments for traders who prefer crypto withdrawals" she adds. Furthermore, Ms Sumedha reveals, “Hola Prime has launched Hola Prime Visa Cards, now available as a standard payout withdrawal method for all traders. The cards provide effortless access to earnings, allowing traders to make online purchases, shop in-store, and withdraw cash from ATMs. This innovative payout method is designed to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience for all Hola Prime traders.” Hola Prime is committed to providing traders with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market. The firm offers funding options of up to $300K, with the potential to scale accounts to $4 million, ensuring traders have access to the capital they need to execute their strategies effectively. The firm emphasizes a lot on education and continuous improvement. Through extensive training resources and expert guidance, Hola Prime equips traders with the knowledge and skills to refine their strategies and make informed decisions. Hola Prime’s innovative features extend beyond technology. The firm has introduced a 95% reward structure and a 200% fee reimbursement policy, designed to reduce financial risks and foster a supportive trading environment. “Our focus is on creating a safer and more reliable trading environment,” says Mr. Kapuria. “By integrating advanced risk management measures and leveraging technology, we aim to support traders in their journey of growth and success.” The prop trading industry has long operated in a cloud of ambiguity, leaving many traders uncertain about fairness and reliability. Hola Prime is addressing these challenges head-on, redefining the industry with its emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and trader empowerment. With a clear and equitable framework, Hola Prime offers traders access to industry-leading platforms, innovative tools, and unparalleled support systems, in addition to 24/7 Live Human Customer Support. By prioritizing fairness and innovation, the firm is setting many new standards for prop trading — that benefit traders and the industry as a whole. Hola Prime’s transformative approach to prop trading is paving the way for a more transparent and equitable future. By combining cutting-edge technology, proactive risk management, and a commitment to trader success, the firm is empowering traders to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Title: 400+ Journalists at “Washington Post” Sign Petition to Bezos
URL: https://dianeravitch.net/2025/01/16/400-journalists-at-washington-post-sign-petition-to-bezos/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
For decades, The Washington Post has been one of the nation’s premier newspapers, widely admired for its fearless journalism. During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, The Post held the reckless Senator from Wisconsin to account. It took the lead in exposing Watergate. A job at The Washington Post was a prize for any journalist. Jeff Bezos bought the paper in 2013. It was widely assumed that he had “saved” the paper from its financial woes because of his wealth and that he would not interfere with its editorial independence. But recently, Bezos’ stance changed. He hired Will Lewis, an editor from the despicable Murdoch empire, to turn the paper around financially. The paper has experienced layoffs and censorship. When Bezos’ spiked the editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall, more than 300,000 subscribers canceled. When an editorial cartoon lampooning billionaires (including Bezos) courting Trump was killed, the cartoonist quit. The morale of the staff hit rock-bottom. David Folkenflik of NPR reported on the rebellion among the journalists: One debacle after another has engulfed The Washington Post since veteran newspaper executive Will Lewis became CEO and publisher a year ago this month, with the charge from owner Jeff Bezos to make the storied newspaper financially sustainable. The appointment of a new executive editor was botched. A killed presidential endorsement led hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel. Top reporters and editors left. Scandals involving Lewis’ actions as a news executive years ago in the U.K. reemerged. A clear vision to secure the Post’s financial future remains elusive. Frustration boiled over on Tuesday night. More than 400 Post journalists, including some editors, signed a petition asking Bezos to intervene. “We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave,” it reads, in part. The petition never cites Lewis by name, but it reads as a sharp indictment of his leadership. Through a spokesperson, Lewis and the Post declined comment for this story. A representative of Bezos did not return a request for comment. For this story, NPR interviewed 10 Washington Post staffers inside the newsroom and on the business side of the paper, including some who did not sign the petition. They agreed to speak to NPR under condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions inside the paper. They say the backlash against Lewis encompasses Bezos to some degree, as he has publicly warmed up to President-elect Donald Trump. (The Post declined comment.) Bezos’ decision to kill a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election led more than 300,000 subscribers to cancel, wiping out much more modest gains The Post had achieved under Lewis. (A spokesperson says The Post has convinced about 20% of those cancelling over the endorsement to remain subscribers.) The decision also led to some resignations. Recent days at the Post have witnessed the continuation of a months-long parade of departures of highly regarded newsroom veterans — most recently, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Rosalind Helderman, investigative reporter Josh Dawsey and columnist Jennifer Rubin. Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after her sketch showing Bezos kneeling before Trump with a bag of money was rejected. The tech titan’s business interests, including Amazon Web Services and the space company Blue Origin, receive billions of dollars from federal contracts. He’s given $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration costs and traveled to Mar-a-Lago with his fiancée to meet with the president-elect. Amazon Studios agreed to pay Melania Trump millions of dollars for a documentary project about her, according to Puck News. Come Monday, Bezos is expected to join Trump advisor Elon Musk and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on the inauguration platform itself. The petition asked for a meeting with Bezos. Open the link to continue reading this important article. I think there should be a mass resignation from WaPo at this point. Band together and create a competing startup. I think fundraising and subscriptions would be very popular. I would sign up. LikeLike Daniel, It’s harder and more costly than you think to start a new newspaper. All of the 400+ who signed the petition have mortgages to pay, household expenses, etc. At this point, some other billionaire would have to buy the paper from Bezos. Someone who understands the idea of editorial independence and freedom of the press. LikeLiked by 1 person His ex-wife perhaps. LikeLike It sounds like neither Lewis nor Bezos, like Trump, know the difference between what Fox/Murdoch does and what the Washington Post has been about for a long time. In my view, if true, then these are morally defunct people, to say the least. If anyone hasn’t seen the movie “The Post,” with Tom Hanks and Merle Streep, it chronicles the crucial run up to the Nixon resignation inspired by that same WAPO and focuses on how difficult it was to stay on their principled track, . . . but they did. But for Lewis and Bezos, not to mention Murdoch, it’s probably “huh”? CBK LikeLike Friendly correction: Bezos bought WaPo in 2013, not 2023. LikeLike Thank you, Jack. I thought I typed 2013. But I didn’t. I do all my blogging on a cell phone and it’s easy to hit the wrong key because they are tiny.

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of U.S. officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell the app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the U.S. if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a deadline to shut it down on Sunday. A law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's U.S. assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns. "We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark," U.S. Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is "significant progress" toward a divestiture. "Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going," said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser. A White House official said on Thursday the Biden administration does not plan to enforce the ban on Sunday leaving it up to the Trump administration, though it is not clear if the app will remain online absent a formal extension. "Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement," the official said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision. The court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided. Trump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance. In a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. BIPARTISAN SHIFT "It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days. "I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security," he added. The comments by Schumer, who was a strong supporter of the law to force a sale, are a sign of the growing concern among prominent Democrats about the potential impact and political fallout of shutting down TikTok. The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) reported Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, "President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump." 'TALKS A BIG GAME' Still, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on U.S. citizens and to spread propaganda to the public. "Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do," Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X. "But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?" The prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million U.S. users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB). Reuters reported that TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.

Title: Microsoft Is Riding The Wave To Long-Term Growth Through AI And Cloud

By Nabeel Bukhari Summary Microsoft Corporation (MSFT, Financial) is a brand familiar to many, with its system integration being a part of life for millions of people globally. However, in an unusual irony, the stock has not risen to the extent expected, given the phenomenal growth of the technology industry in recent years. Nevertheless, Microsoft is still a giant and one of the biggest winners in the generative AI race. Its partnership with OpenAI is not only helpful to Azure's revenue growth but also bestows the company with a powerful role in the field of AI driven innovation. While Microsoft is not screaming value at present, its ability to generate robust double-digit growth with unmatched cash flow generation is almost impossible to ignore. While I've been pulling back on some of my biggest growth winners, Microsoft remains a standout stock with great long-term potential and with the ability to provide great returns. Microsoft's Q1 2025 earnings report shows the company is fully charged, with healthy growth rates coupled with progressive investments. Microsoft Revenue and Net Income Chart Total revenues of the company were up 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $65.6 billion, accelerating from the preceding quarter's growth rate of 15.2% and the 12.8% rate in the same period last year. Earnings per share were not far behind, rising at a 10% rate to $3.30 in part due to smart investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the dilution from Activision Blizzard. Both factors, though modestly impacting the near-term profits, are in fact strategic actions taken for the purpose of securing the company's long-term control. Let's break down the Microsoft's key segments to better understand what drives this growth and where might the company be going next. The essence of Microsoft is in its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is still the biggest source of both revenues and profits for the company at the time being. This segment generated a revenue of $28.3 billion which was up 12% and was ahead of the company's guidance of 10% primarily driven by strong uptake of enterprise products such as Microsoft 365 Copilot that incorporate AI. Management guidance of up to 11% growth next quarter supports the view that businesses will sustain efficiency through advanced AI capabilities. Yet, all the focus is on Azure, the crown jewel in the Intelligent Cloud segment (up 20% and generated a revenue of $24.1 billion) for Microsoft. Azure itself is up a monstrous 33%. Such acceleration proves the company's strength and its close connection with OpenAI which not only improves Azure but also brings in new clients eager for the best AI solutions. While management has forecasted up to a mind-boggling 32% growth next quarter, this is expected to increase in the second half of the year as more AI capacities come online. Azure's growth path may outpace the Productivity segment to become the new cash cow for Microsoft. Last but not least, the More Personal Computing segment's revenue of $13.2 billion, up 17%, is still more cyclical than the rest of the segments. Management anticipates that revenues in this segment will be slightly lower compared to the prior year due to lapping tougher comparables. However, the inclusion of Activision Blizzard as part of this segment points to long-run growth. The acquisition had a dilutive impact of $440 million on operating income this quarter, but synergies and cost discipline should help flip it into a growth driver. Furthermore, Microsoft is a fortress, with $116.2 billion in cash at the end of the quarter against $45 billion in debt. Microsoft Cash and Debt Chart As we look at the graph above, it's evident that the buffer has shrunk significantly compared to previous years. Well, that's due to increased capital expenditures to heavy investments. In 2023, the ratio dropped below 1.5 but the good news is that it has since recovered, back up to 1.28. This dip doesn't take away from the fact that Microsoft is in a great financial position and is well set up for a steady growth trajectory as its AI-driven investments mature. As of recent prices, MSFT found itself trading at around 33x earnings. Consensus estimates depict the stock to clock higher double-digit growth rates in the years to come. I consider these estimates reasonable based on the stellar momentum of Azure. The stock may not even appear as an obvious bargain at around 12x sales, as this multiple ranks highly compared to other software companies. However, I would like to stress that some premium is deserved given that MSFT is already earning such high profit margins, and, therefore, its high earnings yield would contribute to the continuous return prospects. In the longer term, I still expect net margins under GAAP to reach towards 45%-50% as operating leverage starts to kick in, up from 37.7% in the latest quarter. This actually put the current valuation at 25x long-term earnings, which could be considered reasonable with the strong balance sheet and long-term secular growth. Between the consensus estimate of double-digit revenue growth and the roughly 3% earnings yield, I think this stock can deliver between 15% to 17% annual compounded returns for the next five years or more. To get a return less than that projected by the above formula, either the company has to underperform the consensus growth estimates or the stock's valuation would need to compress. Even if we assume that the stock is trading at 21x long-term earnings in five years, the stock will return between 12% to 14% per year and will therefore outperform the average 8% return of the market. MSFT does trade at a slight premium to its 5-year average but is still not as greatly overvalued as one might think given the current tech euphoria and the company's position in it. Over the last five years, Microsoft's stock skyrocketed 160.58% as showed in the graph below, which demonstrates that the company has good opportunities in fast growth sectors like cloud computing, AI and enterprise software. But this performance also speaks about a market that is willing to pay a premium for steady and consistent growth. Microsoft Price Chart Currently, the stock's valuation multiples which I discussed previously are both considerably higher than Microsoft's historical ratios and its sector ‘s median. For the past year, Microsoft posted a 12.40% return, but this does not compare to the kind of growth witnessed previously due to market fluctuations. The stock rose to $450 in mid-2024 but has since corrected to trade in the $410-$425 range. This correction may have come from valuation concerns and other market factors rather than company-specific issues. However, it is important to note that the $400 level is the critical support zone as investors consider any price dip close to this range to be a good buying opportunity. Nonetheless, the current trading price of the stock reflects that the investors lack the enthusiasm to drive the valuations even higher. The $468.35 as a 52-week high is a significant resistance point while $450 has acted as the ceiling over the past year. Penetrating this barrier would require Microsoft to post stellar earnings or for the market sentiment to change. On the other hand, missing the high expectations may lead the stock to retest the $400 support level. In the short term, Microsoft shares are unlikely to move much beyond the $400-$450 range as the investors assess its valuation relative to growth potential. The longer-term stable scenario of maintaining double-digit top-line growth rates, along with GAAP net margin growth towards 45%, can justify further price increases. Investors should be careful of market risk and ensure that the stock's valuation is correct with regard to their investment horizon and risk tolerance. Microsoft fundamentals are good, however, short-term gains are expected to be dependent on its ability to beat high forecasts. The prospects appear favorable for Microsoft, however, there are some risks that may affect the thesis I've described above. First, lower-than-expected AI adoption is a big concern. The growth story heavily draws on Azure performance, depending on AI-powered tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. However, delays in the adoption of these tools or issues related to the implementation of the same can slow down the overall AI and Cloud service revenues as anticipated. This might also slow down the total growth of the company. Another significant risk is the competitiveness threat that Microsoft experiences most in the cloud as well as the AI segments. Azure has been a good performer but in front of Microsoft are giant competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud both of whom are actively using similar technologies. If these competitors advance further or if Azure's expansion is thrown off by more competition, then the rate of revenue expansion, which is core to the thesis could be impacted. Last but not least, regulatory challenges can not be ignored. Microsoft is under increasing pressure from regulators, notably due to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. If regulatory bodies enter or place restrictions on the company, there might be unhealthy hindrances or complicities in the company's expansion strategies. New regulations for Big Tech may also become a problem, which, together with existing problems, can cause additional risks to the company's future. These risks are noteworthy, considering they can influence both growth and valuation assumptions. All in all, Microsoft remains a great stock for the long-term investment. This is being achieved under the stewardship of Azure, which is driving impressive growth and with the company now placing more emphasis on AI, gives the impression that it is poised to benefit from some of the most promising trends in technology. Sure the stock is a little bit on the expensive side, but when you look at the cash flow, healthy margins and growth possibility that is being offered, the premium that is commanded for the stock seems well deserved. Of course, there are a few risks, but Microsoft has proved its abilities to overcome obstacles and to remain ahead of innovations. So as long as it keeps delivering in the AI and cloud sectors as it has done before, I believe the stock will keep on giving good returns. I would recommend Microsoft to anyone seeking solid, market-beating growth in tech, as the company possesses healthy financials and leads in high-growth areas. It's a stock you can hold onto and expect it to pay off in many years to come. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta's 'non-regrettable attrition' and the other corporate lingo used to downplay job cuts

Time Published: 2025-01-16T15:32:52Z

Allow for a quick riff on RIFs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. Whether it's a "reduction in force," "rightsizing," or "streamlining," the fancy language doesn't soften the blow for workers — or hide the reality of lost jobs. One recent example: Meta said this week it would push out an additional 5% of what Mark Zuckerberg called "low-performers." Clear enough. Yet in a subsequent memo from Hillary Champion, Meta's director of people development growth programs, the focus became "non-regrettable attrition." At Amazon, a phrase often used for such cuts is "unregretted attrition." It's the type of language that can draw snark online. Following Meta's announcement, one person wrote on X: "'Non-regrettable attrition' lmao.'" A Meta spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the company plans to fill the vacated positions in 2025. Steve McClatchy, who consults on leadership and is the author of the book "Leading Relationships," told BI that public companies often use euphemistic language around job cuts to try to avoid spooking investors and raising concerns that the business is in trouble. But, he said, that effort often falls flat when they use terms like nonregrettable attrition. "How sad is that language? It's trying to say to the ownership group, we're headed in the right direction, not the wrong one," McClatchy said. There are numerous other ways to frame offboarding, err, cutbacks, err, workforce adjustments, and the need to do so. For example, the news site TechCrunch told BI on Tuesday it's reducing staff because of "evolving needs." It's possible that for many employers, workforce optimization, organizational realignment, and — shout out to ChatGPT for this one — internal mobility challenges just sound better than job cuts. Yet, workplace experts told BI, the fallout is the same. "We're seeing a lot of companies now do everything not to use the actual word layoff, even though that's exactly what they're doing," Peter Rahbar, an employment attorney who founded the boutique law firm the Rahbar Group, told BI. A spokesperson for the food giant Cargill previously told BI that job cuts were designed to "realign our talent and resources to align with our strategy." Last year, Bumble said it would cut about 30% of its workforce "to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities." Cutting jobs is often bad for morale and can hurt productivity when workers become consumed with worrying they're next. That can be true even with a case like that of Meta, which said it planned to "backfill" roles in 2025. Translation: hire better people — though not you. Yet, McClatchy said, to imply that a worker who gets pushed out for poor performance is solely at fault misses the responsibility that employers have to make good hires and that managers have to help those under their tutelage perform their best. "It's 100% an attack on the employee that has to go then find a job. And what a shame that is," he said. Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School who has studied layoffs, told BI that most terms for layoffs are designed to make an otherwise negative act appear more positive. She said companies often use the term regrettable attrition for good workers they're sorry to see leave. So a term like nonregrettable attrition is a way of "sugarcoating" the fact that an employer is letting people go. Connecting it to attrition is meant, Sucher said, to imply that employers have a handle on the outflow. Yet, she said, attrition isn't always something companies can control. "The point of attrition is that you're not managing it. It's something that, by and large, happens to you," she said. Rahbar, the attorney, said employers' choice of wording when it comes to culling workers isn't about protecting themselves legally. Instead, he said, it's mostly a public-relations dance and, ultimately, one that does little good. "If you're an employee who is impacted by this, the language they're using to describe it is irrelevant. It's not going to soften the blow," Rahbar said. Ravin Jesuthasan, a coauthor of the book "The Skills-Powered Organization" and the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI that employers have been cutting jobs for more than a century when business falters. "I don't know why there was a need to introduce new language," he said. In some cases, the words aren't new; they're just redeployed, reassigned, or transitioned to a new role. In Champion's memo at Meta, she wrote that the company was "aiming to exit" an additional 5% of its workers who'd been around long enough to get a performance rating. "'Exit' as in GTFO!" one X user posted. Not all euphemisms might be as likely to whip up worker cynicism, of course. The practice of scoring workers based on various metrics and getting rid of the worst performers sometimes goes by the human-resources shorthand "rank and yank." Corporatespeak can also be a handy way to add levity in uncertain times. One social media user wrote on X about what might happen when artificial intelligence shows up to make cutbacks, oblique language in tow. "Humans will become 'Non-Regrettable Attrition' for AI," the person wrote. Do you have something to share about job cuts or something else at work? Business Insider would like to hear from you.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) U.S.-listed shares rose by more than 6% at the market open on Thursday morning. The chipmaker’s stock was up by more than 5% during pre-market trading after its fourth-quarter earnings results beat expectations. Later in the morning, TSMC’s shares were up by around 5.6%. The company reported net revenue of NT$868.46 billion, or $26.36 billion, and record net income of NT$374.68 billion, or about $11.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31. TSMC said its fourth quarter revenue increased 38.8% year over year, while net income rose 57% from the previous year to a record high. “Our business in the fourth quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Shipments of advanced 3-nanometer chips made up 26% of total wafer revenue, TSMC said, while advanced 5-nanometer chips accounted for 34%, and 7-nanometer chips were 14% of the total. On a post-earnings call with analysts, TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said the company “observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024.” Revenue from TSMC’s AI accelerators “accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024,” Wei said. The Taiwanese chipmaker set revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2025 at between $25 billion and $25.8 billion — higher than a consensus by analysts of $24.4 billion, according to a Jefferies (JEF) note. Wei said TSMC’s first fab in Arizona entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter using the 4-nanometer process, and reached a yield comparable to its facilities in Taiwan. The chipmaker expects “a smooth ramp-up process,” Wei said, and is confident in having “the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as for our fab in Taiwan.” TSMC is also on track with its second and third Arizona fabs, Wei said. Earlier this week, the Biden administration introduced new rules encouraging chip producers such as TSMC to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence in an effort to prevent advanced chips from getting to Chinese customers.

Title: The Best Foods to Buy in Bulk, According to a Meal Planning Pro

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

US stock indexes were slightly lower on Thursday after posting strong gains on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid around 75 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up early gains to edge lower shortly before 10:00 a.m. ET. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: The mixed performance comes after the indexes posted sharp gains on Wednesday, with the Dow up over 700 points to mark the best trading day since a euphoric post-election rally in November. Stocks benefited from encouraging inflation data and strong earnings beats from big financial firms including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BlackRock. Results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley rounded out strong big bank results before Thursday's opening bell, both reporting that profits more than doubled last quarter. Meanwhile, fresh data showed retail sales climbed 0.4% in December, coming in slightly below consensus forecasts of a 0.5% increase. In Europe, indexes traded higher as luxury stocks finally got some relief, posting strong gains after Cartier's owner Richemont announced a quarterly sales record. Luxury stocks had largely struggled in 2024 amid weak consumer demand in China, with companies like Kering posting a 40% decline. Here's what else is happening: Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Worried old husband hugging anxious wife How are we feeling about the stock market, my fellow contrarian? More importantly, should we have an opinion on the market-at-large at all? I don’t think so. Trump 2.0 will create a “market barbell” of big winners and sad losers. Let’s focus on the dividend payers that will be propelled higher—and step over the laggards. There are some dandy dividends ready to dart higher. Today they sit in the bargain bin thanks to investor reservations about the Federal Reserve. When Chairman Jay Powell took the stage in December, he delivered a sober discourse to investors: Don’t expect as many rate cuts as you were hoping for. The lecture was not well received and seriously scared the herd. Fear is prevalent, per CNN’s Fear and Greed Index (FGI): Fear Greed Index Here at Contrarian Outlook we tend to fade the FGI. When emotions are running scared, we buy the bargains from the weak hands. They always have a reason for selling low. Granted, the narrative usually crumbles in the rearview mirror with the passage of time. But the vanilla financial websites must publish some reason that stocks are down today. These days, it’s the hawkish Fed. But is this really bad news? The 10-year Treasury yield has been (paradoxically) rising with each Fed rate cut. That’s not supposed to happen. This is the bond market screaming at Jay that there is no need for these cuts. The economy is fine. It absorbed the rate hikes, and we have seen neither a hard nor safe landing. In fact, we have seen no economic landing at all! Last Friday’s strong jobs report showed this. The unemployment rate fell once again to 4.1%. Remember the August pullback, when pundits and Fed officials alike were sure that we were heading into a recession? It triggered the “Taylor Rule”—a formula that is supposed to predict a recession. Last summer the Fed members seemed to hold the Taylor Rule as Gospel. The Taylor Rule is newer than the Gospel, however. It has been around since… 1992. That surprised me too, as it’s spoken of as if handed down in biblical times. I’m in favor of most trend comebacks from the 90s, but the Taylor rule should have stayed behind. So, the economy is humming, and the Fed finally admits it. Short-term rates will stay “higher for longer.” If this helps “contain” the 10-year yield below 5%, then I’m all for it. Higher short-term rates should contain the economy from overheating. (The path of constant rate cuts combined with “no landing” was not going to do it.) Which brings us to President-Elect Trump, who takes office in five days. The most Dow-friendly president in recent history takes office with a healthy dose of fear in the markets. It is tempting to buy the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average and be done with it—but we can do better. I’ve been running the numbers on how certain stocks performed during Trump 1.0 for clues how investing history may “rhyme” for the next four years. There are a few surprises not appreciated by the mainstream narrative. First, conventional wisdom says to dump healthcare stocks. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be running the Department of Health and Human Services. Sell ‘em all, right? Wrong! The top five holdings of this discounted 14%-paying dividend fund returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during Trump’s first administration, benefiting from lower regulation and a strong economy: BMEZ Holdings Yet the BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ) fund sits at an 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV) on fears that RFK Jr. will obliterate the entire sector. Let’s take a deep breath. RFK does not determine what the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) does, which traditionally operates on its own independent of politics. Plus we have sector blue chips like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) who are likely to roll along merrily as they did in Trump’s first term. UNH and ABT sailed 135% and 199%. Their businesses were good then, and they remain good now! UNH/ABT Total Returns What about energy? Crude oil rallied last Friday on the latest round of US sanctions against Russia. Is reduced supply coupled with a strong economy bullish for energy, or does Trump’s “drill baby, drill” mantra ultimately put a lid on prices? I’ve heard from careful readers concerned that Trump “drilled so much in the first term, he tanked oil.” It’s true that energy prices trended down all four Trump years, but the bear market in oil started in 2014—two years before 1.0—triggered by the US shale oil supply boom that began years prior. So, by the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, these trends were already in motion. So I would not draw many conclusions from these two ugly charts, which feature two of our favorite dividend growers in the energy patch, EOG Resources (EOG) and EQT Corp (EQT): EOG/EQT Total Returns We must deal with government contractors on a case-by-case basis. The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to eliminate $500 billion in spending. This is a potential headwind for federal-powered gravy trains. It’s possible we see a “peace dividend” as well. Trump may cut a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine or with China to ease tensions in the Pacific. Given these headwinds contractors are now generally in “stay away” territory. One exception I am making is for General Dynamics (GD), which is a backdoor play on AI automation at the federal government level. GD flatlined during Trump 1.0 but we have higher expectations this time around given the AI angle. AI plays a central role in General Dynamic’s IT strategy. It has deployed a Luna AI system that uses machine learning to draw insights from large reams of data. Luna is designed specifically for government and defense applications. The “Luna lift” is evident in GD’s new orders and total sales backlog. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

US stocks wavered on Thursday, with the major indexes struggling to build on the previous day's surge amid another round of big bank earnings. Investors also watched as the Senate hearing kicked off for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1%. Markets are coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. Also taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation. Topics investors were watching to surface during the gathering include tariff policies and debt concerns amid Republican initiatives for 2025 tax and spending plans. Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury Secretary highlighted an opportunity for a new 'Golden Age' for the US during opening remarks at his confirmation hearing. "Today, I believe that President Trump has a generational opportunity to unleash a new economic Golden Age that will create more jobs, wealth, and prosperity for all Americans," Bessent told lawmakers on Thursday morning. The nominee highlighted his life's work in the private sector has given him a understanding of the economy and markets. "Having never served in government, I intend if confirmed, to be in close contact with each of you and your offices, and seek your council," said Bessent. He also highlighted the need for the government to ensure the US Dollar remains the world's reserve currency. Lawmakers were making opening remarks on Thursday morning at the confirmation hearing for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The hearing is likely to last about two and a half hours. Likely topics Bessent will face questions on include policies surrounding tariffs, and Republican initiatives for 2025 tax initiatives and spending plans. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, will face questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill today starting at 10:30 a.m ET. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports on two issues to watch for during the hearing which have come into focus this week. One is around a swirl of seemingly competing tariff plans before President-elect Donald Trump, some of which Bessent himself is reportedly pushing. A second is whether Republicans will be able to ignore debt concerns and go big with their 2025 tax and spending plans. Read more here. Builders are starting the year with more optimism than in the end of 2024, despite elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 47 in January, up one point from December and higher than economists’ estimates of 45, per Bloomberg data. Still, a reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. The dilemma of high housing costs persists, with mortgage rates hovering closer to 7% over the past four consecutive weeks, according to Freddie Mac. Markets expect the Fed will likely leave rates unchanged this month, especially after fresh inflation data released Wednesday showed some signs of easing. The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates but its actions influence the direction of yields, which in turn affect borrowing costs. The NAHB survey showed builders continue to offer concessions in January. The survey found that 60% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, while 30% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in January. The average price reduction was 5%, matching December’s price cut. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here.

Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT).

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here. Good chart by the Vanda Research team looking at Mag 7 flows from the retail trading community. You can see activity having slowed down in January with names like Nvidia under pressure. Dare I say it's refreshing to see traders nibble at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500!

Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT).

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

Title: No Country For Young Fintechs: The U.K.’s Debanking Of Crypto Blockchain And Web3
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/01/16/no-country-for-young-fintechs-the-uks-debanking-of-crypto-blockchain-and-web3/

Access denied rubber stamp. A survey of U.K. fintech and crypto firms found that 50 percent of the firms surveyed have been rejected from opening a bank account or had an account closed by a major U.K. bank. Only 14 percent managed to successfully apply for a bank account with one of "the CMA 9” - the nine biggest mainstream banks in the U.K. - without it being closed at a later date. These figures will shock policymakers following a decade of promoting the U.K. ecosystem as the global home of fintech and crypto, as well as the new Labour Government, with its stated intention of supporting innovation and digitization. The lack of access to this basic universal service has meant that firms from across the fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 ecosystems have faced challenges in innovating and scaling, limiting their capacity to introduce new products and services while remaining competitive on a global scale. Katie Harries, who leads Stand With Crypto’s U.K. initiative commented, “The growing difficulties firms face is a huge barrier to growth. It’s not an issue reserved for start and scale-ups but also one medium and large companies face too. We are hugely supportive of Labour’s ambitious growth and investment plans but we currently have a situation where some of the U.K.’s most innovative companies are effectively being deprived of access to basic banking services – hampering these objectives.” The survey, conducted by the Startup Coalition , the U.K. Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC), and Global Digital Finance (GDF) found that 81 percent of respondents were legally based in the U.K. with 98 percent having activities in the U.K. “These challenges pose a significant threat to the U.K. Government's ambition to lead the global race in digital assets, as highlighted by the City Minister in a recent speech. Without meaningful action and progress in tackling barriers such as this, this vision will fall short,” commented Simon Jennings, executive director of the UKCBC. On the debanking crisis, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated in their report in September last year, “given the limitations of the data, [they] had not been able to draw detailed conclusions on the types of personal or business customers affected by suspensions, terminations and declines.” One firm surveyed and rejected by HSBC indicated on their survey response that they were “[rejected because of our] business profile (despite that we are an FCA Regulated firm).” The survey found 81 percent of firms agreed that difficulties accessing banking services are a significant barrier to their company succeeding in the U.K. and 70 percent had found that this made it more likely they would leave the U.K. “This obstacle has pushed many U.K. based firms to consider expensive alternatives like setting up accounts in locations such as Estonia, Poland, and Bulgaria,” says Marcus Foster, head of policy campaigns at the Startup Coalition. Adds Foster, “In the absence of adequate banking services, these firms are being pushed to seek out riskier financing and banking options. This also makes the U.K. a less attractive place to found a crypto or Web3 startup.” In France, the law governing cryptoasset regulation has a specific provision for the treatment of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) or crypto-related businesses, to ensure that they cannot be discriminated against in terms of banking services. The law specifically states that they cannot be denied a bank account by virtue of being a designated VASP. Elise Soucie, executive director of global policy and regulation at GDF says, “Beyond France, other jurisdictions have implemented clear policies to enable access to banking for fintechs. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidance stating that banks should endeavour to support licenses virtual asset service providers (VASPs) their legitimate need for bank accounts in Hong Kong, and the incoming U.S. administration has also made it clear that they plan to support the crypto and broader tech industry.” The U.S. crypto industry was prepared, to some extent, for regulation by enforcement in 2023, following the collapse of FTX, but evidence of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 sent a chill down the spines of crypto CxOs and financiers. Yet, in the past year, with Blackrock and a growing list of financial institutions launching hugely successful bitcoin ETPs and strong crypto overtures from a new incoming U.S. administration, positive changes appear afoot in the U.S. In public remarks leading up to the election, President Elect Trump made his stance clear vowing to create a “bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” A promise he has already delivered on with the nomination of David Sacks, the crypto and AI czar and Bo Hines as executive director of the incoming administration’s new “Crypto Council.” “The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” stated Trump. If the U.S. does create crypto and fintech friendly rules, the U.K. risks falling further behind and losing firms, not only due to lack of clear regulatory frameworks, but also due to lack of access to basic needs such as a bank account. The U.K.’s 2021 ban on crypto derivatives, which was in contrast to industry consultation data including its own consumer survey data, and also in contrast to U.S. policy that saw the CFTC approve bitcoin options contracts on the CME in 2017, was a setback for the U.K. in it claim to be a global fintech hub. A clumsy start to the FCA's crypto registration scheme was another significant setback. Following the optimism for fintech created by the competition mandate granted to the FCA more than a decade ago, in response to the Great Financial Crisis and the failure of two of the four big U.K. banks, there is again much work to do in the U.K. to make Digital Britain attractive to fintechs and crypto firms across both retail and wholesale markets. Legislative progress has been made to promote the growth of digital assets. The Financial Services and Market Act (FSMA), 2023 aims to reform the capital markets, bring payment stablecoins into the scope of regulation, and strengthen the objectives of the financial services regulators including international competitiveness and growth. A new Property (Digital Assets Etc.) Bill, seeks to clarify that certain digital assets, such as crypto tokens, can be recognised as property, even if they do not fit into the two traditional categories of personal property in English and Welsh law. The Digital Securities Sandbox is also a positive development by the Bank of England and the FCA to help to deliver a smooth transition to the issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities in the U.K. While progress has been made laying the legal foundation to position the U.K. as a leading financial hub, much of this new policy and legislation often appears to favour incumbents, especially when taking into account that the U.K. fintech and crypto debanking issue is driven by the nine biggest banks in the U.K. This month, and following significant industry advocacy, HM Treasury amended a law to clarify that crypto staking doesn’t fall under the definition of a “collective investment scheme,” which is typically heavily regulated. While this is a welcome step, more is needed to close the crypto gap with other jurisdictions. Let's get back to first principles: For the U.K. to position itself as a hub for new fintech innovators in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, and to deliver on the promises of growth from the new Government, the debanking problem must be effectively addressed, and now. Fixing fintech debanking is Labour's opportunity to make a tangible change for digital innovators so that they will commit to build and grow new and transformational businesses in the U.K. Following the election, the Labour government now has their chance to fix this problem and fix it for good. With U.K. fintech funding down by a reported 68 percent in 2023, and global fintech funding down a further reported 20 percent in 2024, the U.K. is going to have to increase its incentives to fintechs and digital firms to attract both more homegrown talent and foreign interest and investment. A key action to remedy the debanking problem is to promote transparency, competition, and growth, and to mandate U.K. banks to move away from using generic statements justifying account refusal, especially on the grounds of being engaged with innovative digital technologies. This is especially relevant to innovative digital firms that have already demonstrated their compliance with regulatory and registration requirements. The big concern for fintechs is, that despite the progress the U.K. is making to deliver greater legal and regulatory as it relates to digital assets, it is being undermined as fintechs are further debanked and the crucial on-ramp from fiat to digital assets is choked off. As importantly, fintech debanking is making a mockery of the U.K. Government and its agencies, including the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the U.K.'s claim to be the “home of global fintech”, "crypto friendly", and "a global digital hub”. It appears none of these now, if it ever actually was. A web search of the top ten global fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 companies is telling. The U.K. is likely to have future challenges competing for fintech talent and capital in the global digital space race, especially in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, where the largest market players are domiciled or headquartered outside of the U.K. This is not going to be made easier now that the U.K. Government has shifted its digital priorities to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the digital solution to transform the economy and the lives of its citizens, where the big players are U.S. based. U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week set out a blueprint to turbocharge AI with the promise that AI will deliver a decade of national renewal. While governments and their agencies are always keen on big new and exciting announcements, the fintech industry is set on holding the U.K. Government's feet to the fire on the debanking issue. It is time to fix fintech and crypto debanking in the U.K., now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks pushed on with their run in premarket trading Thursday after gaining steam Wednesday. The good news comes as industry leaders highlight quantum computing advancements and potential growth prospects in the sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT, Financial) shares jumped 15.5%, while Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI, Financial) advanced 3.4%, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS, Financial) gaining 9.6% and IonQ Inc. (IONQ, Financial) rising 1.9%. It reflects a growing interest by investors, spurred by the growing corporate commitment to quantum technologies. However, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial) has been the sector's biggest cheerleader. In the case of Mitra Azizirad, COO of Microsoft's strategic missions and technology division: from 2020, talk will be of businesses moving to become the familiar 'quantum-ready' by 2025. This push is backed up by Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial), which announced that it will host a Quantum Day' at its upcoming GTC conference and is committing to integrate quantum computing within classical systems. Despite some industry sceptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who estimates practical quantum computing is still a couple of decades away, companies are proactively creating the work environments that will make it happen. Microsoft has programs for businesses to help tackle this technological evolution, and Nvidia is now recruiting for roles in quantum research. Since Google broke onto the quantum scene with its Willow quantum chip, the quantum sector has also come under the microscope. Companies in this developing quantum era are positioning themselves for long-term growth and are being watched closely by investors and analysts alike. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Its peak "Trump bump" close of 45,014.04 on Dec. 4 had the index up 6.6% from its Nov. 5 close. Shares of Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. both fell more than 3% Thursday, even as longer 10-year Treasury yields logged a three-session decline of nearly 20 basis points. That was its biggest such drop since Aug. 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data — with the August three-day decline coming on the heels of a drastic unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade. The 10-year yield fell to 4.606% Thursday, retreating from its one-year high of 4.802% set on Monday. But a cautious tone remained in markets, with investors focused on what policies might be a top priority under the incoming Trump administration — and the Treasury market's likely reaction to them.

AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joseph Adinolfi (SpotGamma) On Friday, options traders will face the first expiration of monthly contracts of 2025. Contracts tied to $4.2 trillion worth of stocks, ETFs and indexes will either be exercised, or expire worthless, according to data from SpotGamma. The $4.2 trillion figure is smaller than December's record-breaking "triple witching" expiration, which came in at $6.6 trillion, according to data from Asym 500. Still, SpotGamma founder Brent Kochuba pointed out that the value of single-stock options expiring is "unusually large," owing to Wednesday's strong stock-market rally. He added that the expiration could mark a near-term top for the market. "Relative call values surged due to yesterday's large rally, and the expiring of these calls may mark a short-term top in the market, particularly ahead of the inauguration and FOMC," Kochuba said in emailed commentary. 1 day ago By Vivien Lou Chen U.S. government debt rallied for a third session on Thursday, pushing yields to their lowest closing levels in weeks, after Fed governor Christopher Waller opened the door to the possibility of three or four rate cuts in 2025. The 2-year yield ended at 4.237%, the lowest since Dec. 12. The 10-year rate finished at 4.606%, the lowest since Jan. 3.

Small-caps, utilities and real-estate stocks were being bought on the back of easing Treasury yields. The same wasn't the case for rate-sensitive technology stocks, including megacap names like Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. "We do think equity markets will continue to move up," said Luke Tilley, chief economist and head of economics, asset allocation and quantitative services for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, in an interview. But Tilley is also cautious on large-cap stocks due to uncertainty about policies from the second Trump administration that could drive the 10-year Treasury yield higher. He also expects the labor market to weaken from here and for inflation to ease further, opening up the potential for 100 basis points of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in 2025. S&P 500 Utilities Sector Index XX:SP500.55 (S&P US) S&P 500 Technology Hardware Storage & Peripherals Industry Index XX:SP500.452020 (S&P US) Apple Inc. AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth The big three U.S. equity indexes were modestly lower Thursday, but small caps were bucking the trend. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.1% in the final hour of trade, but also outperforming its large-cap counterparts with a 3.5% gain so far this week, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was struggling to secure a fourth straight day of gains Thursday, and was up 2.1% so far in the week. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Bank earnings set a positive tone this week as more major corporations gear up to roll out their quarterly results. Net interest margins, credit trends and overall consumer and business lending look very solid, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. "I think that’s given investors a needed catalyst to say: Things are okay," he told MarketWatch. But any big disappointments in earnings, especially from highflying tech stocks, could deliver a shock to markets, he added. So could any aggressive rollout of tariffs by the Trump administration or any strong retaliatory response from U.S. trading partners, Saglimbene said. Inflation progress might be stalling in some areas, but Saglimbene said that isn't his main concern for 2025.  DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) 1 day ago By Christine Idzelis An equal-weight measure of the S&P 500 was rising Thursday afternoon, even as major U.S. stock indexes traded down. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which tracks an index that equally weights stocks in the broad U.S. large-cap equities index, was up 0.6% in afternoon trading, according to FactSet data, at last check. The ETF was outperforming the S&P 500, which has heavy exposure to stocks in the information-technology sector. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% in afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%, according to FactSet data, at last check. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP (U.S.: NYSE Arca) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth The tech-driven selloff in stocks was gathering some steam in afternoon trade, leaving the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 near their session lows. Dow was off about 115 points, or 0.3%, near 43,101. S&P 500 was 0.3% lower, near 5,932. Nasdaq Composite shed about 160 points, or 0.8%. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Investors were "holding tight" as the nation's biggest banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings season on a positive note and ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Management. "Basically, it's a bit of sideways movement" in stocks on mixed economic data and as the "earnings season is getting off to a good start," Cardillo told MarketWatch. The parade of earnings due to get under way next week could be a catalyst for a pullback — or it could pave the way for fresh record highs for stocks, he said. The bond market, however, has been paying close attention to Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing for Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury secretary, in order to get a sense of the incoming Trump administration's policy priorities. "He's making a big pitch for the extension of 2017 tax cuts," Cardillo said of Bessent. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Stocks and bond yields were meandering Thursday afternoon as investors tuned in to a Senate hearing for Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent for clues about the policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration. Standouts, however, in stocks were the S&P 500's rate-sensitive utilities and real-estate sectors, which were up 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively, according to FactSet. The broader S&P 500 was up less than 0.1%. The sharp rise in longer Treasury yields since November pulled both sectors lower. But they were getting a nice bounce as the 10-year yield pulled back to about 4.6% from a high of 4.8% earlier in the week.

Plus: The use of AI kissing apps and their promotion on social media including Meta and TikTok have some experts concerned about the lack of consent involved and the continued rise of deepfakes. Good morning, Corporate training videos can be dull. But one British startup is betting it can use AI to change that. Synthesia’s AI avatars are already used by companies like Xerox, Spirit Airlines and chemicals giant DuPont to convert training text into videos in over 20 languages—with just one click. Synthesia just raised $180 million, valuing it at $2.1 billion, to make its avatars more lifelike and invest in tools for creating and hosting videos. Eventually, the company could compete with giants like OpenAI’s Sora or AI video startup Runway. But Synthesia’s lucrative niche making human proxies means its customers are more likely to be HR teams rather than Hollywood directors. President Joe Biden speaks about the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken look on. Israel and Gaza-based militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal Wednesday after more than 15 months of fighting and just days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. President Joe Biden said in a press conference that American hostages would be released as part of the first phase of the deal, but that all other details of the plan would be forthcoming. Officials believe 98 hostages remain in Gaza and that about 60 are still alive, per the Washington Post. If ByteDance were to sell TikTok to avoid an impending ban in the U.S. (which it has indicated it has no plans to do), how much would it be worth? Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner leading a group bidding for the social media giant, thinks TikTok’s U.S. business is worth $20 billion without its powerful “recommendation engine” which suggests new videos. But with the prized algorithm, one analyst thinks that a price of $300 billion “could be conservative.” MORE: Trump is considering ways to prevent TikTok’s potential ban, including a possible executive order, according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the social media company’s CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the president-elect’s inauguration next week, with the New York Times reporting that he was formally invited by the inaugural committee. Inflation is still not back to the pre-pandemic norm. Inflation reached its highest level since the summer in December, at 2.9% year-over-year, though it was in line with economists’ projections. The higher inflation reading was at least in part a reflection of price increases tied to the turn of the calendar year, according to two Goldman Sachs economists. But core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy price changes, was 3.2%, better than consensus estimates. MORE: Markets responded strongly to the report, the first inflation reading of the year, as the S&P 500 ended up 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.65% and the Nasdaq surged 2.45%, their best days since November 6. Still, one strategist warned the market’s recent fickle nature should keep investors on their toes. Payments startup Bolt’s $450 million raise is on ice after investors sued to block the round, but one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup, ending a legal dispute that began in July 2023. The Blue Origin New Glenn rocket lifts off Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn heavy lift rocket into orbit early Thursday—though it failed to meet a secondary goal of recovering a reusable booster stage of the rocket, which was lost during reentry. Still, the launch helps Blue Origin notch a key milestone as it aims to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Three-year-old startup Saronic, which aims to make a fleet of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy, is in talks to raise $500 million, Forbes has learned. The fundraising round would value the nascent company at over $3 billion, the latest signal of booming venture capital interest in defense tech. In his farewell address Wednesday night, President Joe Biden warned Americans about what he called an oligarchy “of extreme wealth, power and influence” taking root in the U.S. The president also took aim at Big Tech, saying that he was “concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex,” while calling for more safeguards on powerful AI technologies. President-elect Donald Trump hosted 22 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. All these visitors, including dozens of other political powerbrokers, will likely boost Mar-a-Lago’s bottom line: Profits at the club have already more than doubled since the end of Trump’s first term. Drake sued Universal Music Group, which represents both himself and rapper Kendrick Lamar, accusing the major music company of defamation for releasing and promoting Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Drake’s lawsuit claims that UMG—but not Lamar—falsely promoted the ideas that Drake has committed acts of pedophilia and sex trafficking, which the rapper denies. The delays at the heart of the lawsuit date back to 2022. The Transportation Department sued Southwest Airlines over “chronically delayed flights,” its latest action after fining JetBlue Airways over the same issue earlier this month. The lawsuit alleges Southwest flights from Chicago to Oakland and from Baltimore to Cleveland reached their destinations late nearly 200 times in 2022, according to CNBC. Brightline West, a bullet train project from billionaire investor Wes Eden to connect Las Vegas with suburban Los Angeles, is raising $2.5 billion from private investors with a tax-exempt bond offering. The new funding push, along with a $3 billion federal grant and other funds, is intended to help cover the estimated $12.4 billion needed to complete the line. Brightline seeks to launch passenger service by late 2028. As wildfires rage in Southern California, many are asking what they can do to help. Tax-exempt charities accepting wildfire-specific donations include the American Red Cross, the California Fire Foundation, the Los Angeles Food Bank and Direct Relief. Even if you’re not planning to claim a tax deduction, some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations—like checking to see that the organization you’re giving to has its paperwork in order—are good rules to follow. MORE: Those impacted by the fire may get some relief from the IRS and the tax code, for instance, by taking an early withdrawal from a workplace retirement savings account without the penalty. And individuals and businesses in a federally declared disaster area are entitled to claim casualty loss deductions. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; IMAGE BY BORIS SV/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE Meta and TikTok have run thousands of ads for apps that use AI to generate fake kissing videos of people, allowing users to upload photos of any two people and let AI convert them into a video of them kissing. The apps are being marketed as tools that would allow you to instantly “kiss anyone you want”—no consent required. Similar in concept to “AI nudifier” apps that produce nonconsensual deepfake pornography, these AI kissing apps create believable videos of people doing something they didn’t do. And the ease at which they do it is a concerning habitualization of deepfake imagery. While the ads are not sexually explicit like the deluge of AI-generated pornographic content that has engulfed social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit and YouTube, they can be equally dangerous, Haley McNamara, an executive at the National Center for Sexual Exploitation told Forbes. The companies behind these video generators appear to be based outside the U.S. in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Italy and China, according to their websites. The apps are available for free on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store and already have millions of downloads. The spread of AI kissing apps, boosted by social media’s virality, illustrate a troubling mainstreaming of deepfakes in the age of generative AI. Use of these seemingly harmless apps could open the door to tools that could create more graphic imagery like deepfake porn and other types of image-based sexual abuse, McNamara said. “It’s just an absolute Pandora’s box,” she said. WHY IT MATTERS “The rise of an ‘AI kissing trend’ on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok represents the mainstreaming of deepfakes at a time when AI tools are being used to create nonconsensual pornographic deepfakes,” says Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava. “As is the case with AI image generators like Stable Diffusion, such systems can be misused to create videos of someone without their consent, and bully or harass them.” MORE Almost Half The Girls At This School Were Targets Of AI Porn. Their Ex-Classmates Have Now Been Indicted. Apple and Google have delisted apps developed by the Huione Group, a Cambodian company accused on Tuesday of running the biggest dark web market of all time: As much as $24 billion: The amount of sales that have gone through the Huione Guarantee platform, according to crypto crime tracker Elliptic $5 billion: The amount of sales on the next most lucrative illegal bazaar, Hydra ‘The largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated’: Elliptic said of Huione’s Telegram-based platform Finally receiving a job offer after a lengthy search feels like a huge weight lifted, but the next step, salary negotiation, requires careful navigation. First, research industry-specific salary ranges, and consider other forms of compensation, like stock options, health benefits and bonus structures. Try to strike a balance between being assertive and diplomatic. If a company provides a lowball offer, counter with a well-researched figure that reflects your true worth. As a potential TikTok ban looms, some users are flocking to one of China’s most popular social media apps. Which app is it? A. WeChat B. Weibo C. RedNote D. Tencent QQ Check your answer.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Q4 Earnings: 3nm and 5nm Nodes Lead Topline Growth, Expands Margins, Issues Strong Q1 Outlook

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: ‘Deeply alarmed’: 400 Washington Post journalists demand Jeff Bezos' intervention – What went wrong?

Washington Post has reportedly seen a mass exodus of talent, following which at least 400 journalists have written to the Post's owner Jeff Bezos seeking an intervention, and expressing concern over the future of the esteemed newspaper. The plea from staff comes a week after the The Post laid off roughly 100 employees, amid financial struggles. The layoffs amounted to roughly 4% of the publication’s staff. According to a report by CNN, the list of 400 journalists include some well known correspondents like the publication’s chief correspondent Dan Balz. They have requested Jeff Bezos to visit the Washington, DC, newsroom and speak to the The Post's leaders. The letter, obtained by CNN, read “we are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent.” The Washington Post journalists have said in their letter to Jeff Bezos ‘trust has been lost’ and has sought in-person meeting with billionaire owner over paper’s future. “This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and re-establishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication,” it continues. While the letter to Jeff Bezos doesn’t mention The Post publisher and CEO William Lewis by name, it strongly suggested the staff had lost faith in the newspaper’s leadership. According to CNN, over the past year, William Lewis has made disruptive changes to The Post and been accused of harboring hostility toward the newsroom. Lewis has also reportedly continued to face questions about his journalistic integrity relating to his past work as a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers. Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, hired William Lewis little more than a year ago, charging him with turning around the money-losing publication. CNN notes, Jeff Bezos has been a mostly hands-off owner of The Post, and in some ways that has been a blessing, giving the newspaper’s journalists autonomy to write critically about Bezos, Amazon and related topics. The letter acknowledges that Jeff Bezos’s decision to block The Post editorial board’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was “the owner’s prerogative.” The non-endorsement caused hundreds of thousands of Post subscribers to cancel as a form of protest. The Post lost 250,000 subscribers, or 10% of its subscription base, following its decision not to endorse. This reportedly was a massive contributor to the paper losing a whopping $100m in 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal. Digital visitors for the Washington Post website are also down, dropping from 114 million in November 2020 to 54 million in November 2024, according to Guardian report. Jeff Bezos did not immediately comment on the letter that he received. However, last month, in rare public comments about the Post, Bezos said at The New York Times DealBook Summit that the The Post “needs to be put back on a good footing again.” Jeff Bezos didn’t specify how he’ll do that but said, “I have a bunch of ideas and I’m working on that right now.” “We’ve saved the Washington Post once,” Bezos added, and “this will be the second time.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

The slowdown in the job market appears to have affected the most prestigious Ivy League institutes. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, at least 23 per cent of job-seeking Harvard MBA students who graduated last year were still looking for a job, three months after leaving the campus. The unemployment rate among fresh graduates has increased steadily in recent years with 20 per cent unable to land a job in 2023 and 10 per cent in 2022. The trend extends beyond the Harvard Business School (HBS) with other elite business schools such as Stanford, Wharton, and NYU Stern also reporting some of the weakest job-placement rates. "We're not immune to the difculties of the job market. Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator. You have to have the skills," explained Kisten Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development and alumni relations for HBS. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have reduced MBA recruiting, as have consulting firms, the report highlighted. To salvage the situation, Harvard is now testing an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can compare job seekers' resumes with their preferred roles and recommend online classes to bridge skill gap. While the job market is bad, students who have lowered their expectations have managed to find jobs unlike those still waiting for the top firms to come their way. "Most of my friends who tempered their expectations were able to land great positions. HBS students (are) self-selecting out of certain jobs that may be seen as a 'step down' from their roles before the MBA despite them being perfectly great well-paying jobs," an unnamed HBS MBA student was quoted as saying by Forbes. "HBS students tend to come from wealthier families and backgrounds that can stomach a few months of unemployment."

The latest strategic investment by Nvidia shows its bravery towards industrial AI and robotics. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The chip giant has also provided Taiwan's MetAI with capital in its $4 million seed funding round, making Nvidia its first investment in a Taiwanese company. Kenmec Mechanical Engineering, Solomon Technology, SparkLabs Taiwan, Addin Ventures, and Upstream Ventures were other participants in the funding round. MetAI builds AI-powered digital twin platforms for its own advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities, smart warehouses, and automation systems. It converts a CAD file into a stripped-down SimReady 3D environment within minutes to ease the time to market digital twins for industrial applications. As generative physical AI is an area of increasing focus, Nvidia's partnership with MetAI is a holistic approach to the integration of predictive physical AI that can be trained in simulation environments to deploy robots in autonomous systems. Later this year, the company launched its Mega framework within the Omniverse platform to further digital twin products in the company's broader AI ecosystem. CEO and co-founder of MetAI Daniel Yu said that digital twins have slowed physical AI down in the past because they took so long to be developed.

Title: Meta just flipped the switch that prevents misinformation from spreading in the United States
URL: https://www.platformer.news/meta-ends-misinformation-enforcement-zuckerberg/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
The company built effective systems to reduce the reach of fake news. Last week, it shut them down I. Last week, Meta announced a series of changes to its content moderation policies and enforcement strategies designed to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The company ended its fact-checking program in the United States, stopped scanning new posts for most policy violations, and created carve-outs in its community standards to allow dehumanizing speech about transgender people and immigrants. The company also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion program. Behind the scenes, the company was also quietly dismantling a system to prevent the spread of misinformation. When the company announced on Jan. 7 that it would end its fact-checking partnerships, the company also instructed teams responsible for ranking content in the company’s apps to stop penalizing misinformation, according to sources and an internal document obtained by Platformer. The result is that the sort of viral hoaxes that ran roughshod over the platform during the 2016 US presidential election — “Pope Francis endorses Trump,” Pizzagate, and all the rest — are now just as eligible for free amplification on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as true stories. In 2016, of course, Meta hadn’t yet invested huge sums in machine-learning classifiers that can spot when a piece of viral content is likely a hoax. But nine years later, after the company’s own analyses found that these classifiers could reduce the reach of these hoaxes by more than 90 percent, Meta is shutting them off. Meta declined to comment on the changes. Instead, it pointed me to a letter and a blog post in which it had hinted that this change was coming. The letter was sent in August by Zuckerberg to Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In it, Zuckerberg expressed his discomfort with the Biden Administration’s efforts to pressure the company to remove certain posts about COVID-19. Zuckerberg also expressed regret that the company had temporarily reduced the distribution of stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which Meta and Twitter had both done out of fear that they had been the result of a Russian hack-and-leak operation. The few hours that the story’s distribution was limited would go on to become a Republican cause célèbre. As a kind of retroactive apology for bowing to censorship requests in the past, and for the company’s own actions in the Hunter Biden case, Zuckerberg said that going forward, the company would no longer reduce the reach of posts that had been sent to fact checkers but not yet evaluated. Once they had been evaluated, Meta would continue to reduce the reach of posts that had been designated as false. In hindsight, this turned out to be the first step toward killing off Meta’s misinformation efforts: granting hoaxes a temporary window for expanded reach while they awaited fact checking. That brings us to the blog post: Joel Kaplan’s “More speech, fewer mistakes,” which was published last Tuesday and among other things announced the end of the company’s US fact-checking partnerships. Buried toward the bottom were these two sentences: At the time, Kaplan did not elaborate on which of these demotions the company planned to get rid of. Platformer can now confirm that misinformation-related demotions have been eliminated at the company. The company plans to replace its professional fact-checking program with volunteers from the user base appending information to posts in a system modeled after X’s community notes. But Meta has offered few details on how the program will work, and has not said when it will become available. As a result, Meta has chosen to open a window for viral hoaxes to spread unchecked on its properties while it works to build a new system to mitigate their impact. II. Meta’s efforts to detect misinformation had their roots in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. In response to outrage over the spread of “Pope endorses Trump” and other hoaxes in the run-up to Trump’s election, Meta promised lawmakers and regulators around the world that it would take steps to improve the quality of information on its platforms. From the start of that initiative, Meta’s integrity teams worked hand-in-hand with the third-party fact checkers it hired after the election. In a 2018 blog post, the company explained the variety of signals it used to determine whether its ranking algorithms might be showing you something false: Notably, none of these changes actually eliminated anyone’s freedom of expression. Instead, they restricted what the technologist Aza Raskin has termed “freedom of reach.” Fact-checking and down-ranking obviously false stories allowed liars and hoaxsters to express themselves but sought to limit the negative effects of those lies on Meta’s customers. In May 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Meta boasted about how well this effort was working. In a blog post, the company said that 95 percent of people who saw labels warning that a post contained misinformation declined to view it. The company said that in March 2020 alone, it displayed warnings related to COVID-19 on 40 million posts. Going forward, Meta will instead ask users to add their own annotations to these and other posts. Academics, journalists, lawmakers, and other interested parties will undoubtedly still conduct their own reviews of viral posts on Meta platforms in the coming months to assess the misinformation landscape. But they’ll be doing it without a critical tool they used in the past: CrowdTangle, a free services that exposed what posts on Facebook and Instagram were most popular via searchable real-time dashboards. Meta killed off CrowdTangle in August, directing users instead to an alternative that lacks many of CrowdTangle’s core features. In publishing this story, I realize that I may be giving ammo to those who believe that misinformation is a root cause of our polarization in the United States. As Joe Bernstein wrote in Harper’s 2021, discussions of misinformation sometimes lend too much credence to the idea that algorithms are all-powerful shapers of reality, and fail to reckon with the fact that people will always seek out information that aligns with their worldview. Their demand for that information, whether it is true or false, may be the most important factor leading to its creation and its spread. But it’s possible to believe that a total fixation on misinformation is counterproductive and also believe in the idea of harm reduction: that sophisticated systems that accurately identify hoaxes and then show them to fewer people ought to be left in place, at least until their replacement has been rolled out and evaluated for its effectiveness. For now, these changes only apply to the United States — though you get the sense that Zuckerberg would happily roll them out anywhere else he’s allowed to.

Title: Bannon vs Musk: How Trump’s U-turn on H-1B visas has split MAGA
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/16/bannon-vs-musk-how-trumps-u-turn-on-h-1b-visas-has-split-maga
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:18:29Z
Full Content:
Trump’s tech allies Musk and Ramaswamy are at loggerheads with the MAGA camp over a visa programme that brings foreign workers. Days before Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States, a feud between his tech allies and champions of his far-right MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda over H-1B visas has exploded. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon accused Elon Musk of trying to establish “techno-feudalism on a global scale” in a fresh broadside against the billionaire businessman this week. Bannon’s sharp rhetoric against the controversial visa programme, which allows the hiring of highly skilled tech workers from overseas, has come as others in Trump’s orbit, such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, have also tried to argue that US companies need trained foreign employees. That argument has come under fire not just from Bannon, but also from other far-right supporters of Trump – even as Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, have now softened their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the programme needs to be reformed. But what is the H-1B scheme that is splitting Trump’s allies? Why is it so divisive? Has Trump’s own U-turn on the issue contributed to tensions within the MAGA movement? And how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech – a sector that traditionally leaned towards the Democrats but has in recent weeks almost bent over backwards to placate the incoming president? The H-1B is a temporary and non-immigrant US visa that allows companies in the US to bring in highly skilled workers from abroad. In 2016, Trump called the programme, which was introduced in the 1990s under Republican President George HW Bush, “very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, Trump imposed a temporary ban on H-1B visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. But less than five years later, the US president-elect has thrown his weight behind the visa scheme, saying: “It’s a great programme.” “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B,” he told New York Post. Those comments came at a time when Musk was facing pushback from MAGA supporters. Musk played a key role in Trump’s win as he pumped money into the presidential campaign and used X to megaphone hardline MAGA views. That has earned him Trump’s goodwill and influence. But Trump has pushed back on the notion that Musk enjoys outsized influence. “And no, he’s not taking the presidency,” Trump made the comments during a speech in December, days after the Tesla owner led efforts to kill a spending bill in Congress. Experts say Trump will need to manage a delicate balance between the Silicon Valley elite, whom he needs for his plans to create jobs, and the MAGA base, from where he draws his political support. The H-1B is “the largest temporary work visa” programme in the US, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, DC-headquartered think tank. There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B visas guaranteed, set to 65,000 H-1B visas per fiscal year. It is decided by a lottery system, which randomly selects when the number of visa petitions exceeds the cap. The foreign worker must be employed in a specialised occupation with at least a bachelor’s degree. The employer sponsors foreign workers from the fields of information technology, medicine and publication. The visa is granted for three years but can be extended to six years. American and Indian tech companies – and a few consulting firms – dominate the scheme. Six of the top 10 beneficiaries of the scheme in 2024 were US companies, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a nonpartisan think tank on trade and immigration: Amazon, Cognizant, IBM, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Three are Indian: Infosys, TCS and HCL. Capgemini, a French tech and consulting firm, rounds up the list. But there is another, major new beneficiary of the scheme, per the NFAP’s data: Musk’s electric car giant Tesla. In 2024, Tesla won 742 new H-1B visas through the lottery, more than double the 328 it secured in 2023. In addition, Tesla had another 1,025 existing H-1B visas extended in 2024. “Due to data limitations, we don’t have a good sense of the total H-1B visa holders currently in the US. However, as of 2019, close to 600,000 highly skilled immigrants worked in the US economy on H-1B visas. Approximately 120,000 immigrant workers received new H-1B visas in 2024,” Batalova said. However, it isn’t just MAGA advocates who are critical of the scheme. Ronil Hira, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Howard University, said that the H-1B programme needs to be reformed. Problems plaguing the programme, he said, include the poor selection process, where “eligibility standards are too low, so the application lottery is flooded”, and “visa winners are selected by lottery instead of rational criteria”. The recent argument began when far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticised Trump’s pick for artificial intelligence (AI) adviser, Sriram Krishnan, who has argued the US needs more foreign skilled workers to remain competitive in the technology industries. On December 28, Musk threatened to “go to war” on the issue. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk posted. Musk was born in South Africa and previously held an H-1B visa before he became a naturalised US citizen. Ramaswamy jumped on the debate, saying that technology companies hire foreign-born employees because of a difference in culture. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote, without mentioning the H-1B visa. But he later clarified that the H-1B system “is badly broken [and] should be replaced”. Bannon, who served under Trump’s previous term, has called the H-1B programme a “total scam” as it allows tech companies to bring cheap labour from abroad at the cost of American workers. He has called for the deportation of H-1B visa holders as part of the wider deportation plans. He railed particularly against Musk, saying the Tesla owner’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire. That’s his objective,” Bannon told the Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, on January 8 “He will do anything related to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. His aggregation of wealth, and then – through wealth – power: that’s what he’s focused on. The American working people in this country are not going to tolerate it.” Batalova explained that immigration has long been a contentious policy area in the US. There are “two existential perspectives battling over the hearts and minds of the American public and voters”, she said. She elaborated that one perspective perceives immigrant workers, such as those on H-1B visas, as contributors to US economic power and global competitiveness. The other perspective views immigrant workers as competitors for jobs and limited economic resources. Batalova added that this struggle has, at the moment, resurged and is “fuelled in big part by voter discontent of how the government handled immigration after the COVID-19 pandemic, but also discussions about economic security and national competitiveness, particularly regarding China”. “Major tech companies and business groups continue to lobby for expanding the programme, arguing it is crucial for maintaining America’s innovative edge. However, layoffs in the tech sector, combined with cases of worker replacement at various companies, have provided ammunition for H-1B critics.” Criticism of the H-1B visa has also come from the left. On December 29, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told Fox News that the H-1B needs to be reformed. “You can’t underpay these H-1B folks coming in,” Khanna said. The programme “shouldn’t be for accountants or entry-level IT jobs. It should really be for exceptional talent. We should have that balance”. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also criticised the H-1B visa programme. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,” he posted on X. Elon Musk is wrong. The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make. pic.twitter.com/Mwz7i9TcSM — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 2, 2025 Around 70 percent of H-1B visa recipients are from India and another 10 percent are from China. As the debate rages in the US, some tech firms have withdrawn job offers to Indian workers, according to a report in the Indian newspaper, Times of India. But India’s Ministry of External Affairs argued that H-1B visas benefit both countries. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-US economic ties, which are to our mutual benefit,” Randhir Jaiswal, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said during a news conference on January 3. Trump’s campaign promises during the election comprised a hardline immigration policy. He has threatened to carry out mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and boost security at the border to prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. A month after he was voted in, he told NBC’s Kristen Welker on a Meet the Press episode that he plans to end birthright citizenship in the US, a policy that has been in place for more than 150 years. The right is guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. However, during the interview, the president-elect said he was willing to work with Democrats to keep “Dreamers”, undocumented people who arrived in the US as children and have lived in the country most of their lives. When it comes to the H-1B visa in Trump’s second term, “no one knows what Trump will do. He did nothing in his first term even though he campaigned to reform the programme. It was a glaring unfulfilled promise”, Hira, of Howard University, said. “The Republicans control Congress [both House and Senate] and the White House, so they have the power to change the programme for better or for worse, or keep the status quo. Will they exercise that power for change? Internal political calculations will dictate the direction they take.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Seaport upgraded Netflix to Buy from Neutral, with a price target of $955- representing an upside of 12.5% from Wednesday’s close. The brokerage said it expects higher than initially anticipated additions in members- at 9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to prior expectations of 5.7 million. Seaport also sees Netflix’s original content providing strong tailwinds to the stock, especially with the release of the second season of smash hit Squid Games during the quarter. The brokerage said advertising growth, more top content projects and the winning of live sports rights- such as the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson match- all heralded a positive quarter. “NFLX should remain a core holding due to top-line growth, OI margin expansion, and FCF conversion,” Seaport analysts wrote in a note. Netflix will report its December quarter earnings on January 21. The company is expected to clock earnings per share of $4.2 on revenue of $10.13 billion.

Title: NetApp sells Spot and CloudCheckr to cloud cost control company Flexera

UPDATED 20:50 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley NetApp Inc. is selling a portfolio of its software assets to the cloud cost management specialist Flexera Software LLC. Today’s announcement revealed that Flexera will acquire parts of NetApp’s Spot by NetApp and CloudCheckr products in a deal. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s valued at about $100 million, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg noted that the sale likely follows a decision by NetApp to streamline its business and double down on its core operations, in line with a wider industry trend. It added that global asset sales increased by 26% in 2024, rising to almost $555 billion. Spot and CloudCheckr’s tools are used by companies to keep track of the cost of using different cloud computing services. In the case of Spot, it provides continuous automation, optimization and insights around customer’s cloud infrastructure investments, helping them to maximize their cloud resource usage. NetApp bought Spot in 2020 for an undisclosed price, with reports at the time saying it paid in excess of $450 million. Flexera specializes in cloud service orchestration, policy management and cost optimization tools. As such, managing cloud environments is its core business, which may make it a better fit for Spot. In contrast, NetApp is more focused on providing unified data storage that spans cloud and on-premises data center environments. It has some big ambitions to create an intelligent data infrastructure to support generative AI workloads. In addition, it also sells data center hardware based on all-flash storage systems. NAND Research Inc. analyst Steve McDowell told SiliconANGLE that when NetApp acquired Spot almost five years ago, it was focused on building a cloud operations business. “Since that time, NetApp has refined its cloud strategy and today it’s more focused on bringing ONTAP to the public cloud, and it has been one of the more successful cloud storage stories in the industry,” the analyst said. “NetApp is no longer trying to be in the cloud operations business, so that made Spot an awkward fit.” The only slight downside to the deal for NetApp is the reported price it received for Spot. “We don’t know what NetApp’s revenue from Spot was over the past five years, so it’s impossible to know if it broke even,” McDowell added. “I suspect it didn’t, but the sale is still a much better option than just shutting the business down.” Flexera Chief Executive Jim Ryan said the acquisition of Spot will improve its ability to “tackle the proliferation of hybrid cloud cost and usage challenges across public cloud, data centers, SaaS and even AI.” “Acquiring Spot gives Flexera a stellar set of mature cloud FinOps capabilities that it can quickly deploy to its customers,” McDowell said. “It’s a great acquisition for the company, adding new capabilities that give it a really comprehensive set of features for its customers.” Investors seemed to approve of the sale, with NetApp’s stock closing the day up 1.5%, giving it a market capitalization of about $24 billion. In the last year, its stock has risen 35%. Flexera is a privately held firm that was acquired by the equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC in 2020. TA Associates LLC and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board are also said to hold minority stakes in the company.

LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (Rocket Lab or the Company), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc. (Varda) is successfully operating on orbit. The mission launched January 14, from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 11:09 PDT (19:09 UTC). This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250115691114/en/ Rocket Lab's Pioneer spacecraft for Varda's W-2 mission in the cleanroom at Vandenberg Space Force Base. (Photo: Business Wire) Varda's W-2 mission includes a Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft and a Varda re-entry capsule carrying a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The capsule employs a heatshield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed in collaboration with NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. These payloads are in addition to Varda's expanded pharmaceutical reactor which will expand capability and capacity for pharmaceutical processing. The W-2 mission follows on from Rocket Lab's first mission for Varda, which operated in orbit for eight months before returning to Earth in early 2024 in a successful demonstration of the world's first orbital manufacturing mission conducted outside of the International Space Station. Like the first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda, the W-2 Pioneer is delivering critical mission functions for Varda's 120kg capsule including power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control. Following the payload processing phase in orbit, Rocket Lab's spacecraft will guide and position Varda's capsule for deorbit, enabling a hypersonic re-entry and recovery at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, operated by Southern Launch. The Pioneer spacecraft was designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex and headquarters in Long Beach, California. It integrates Rocket Lab's vertically developed components and systems, including star trackers, propulsion systems, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, tanks, separation systems, and more.

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Peter Himler Follow Adventures in Consumer Technology -- Listen Share And It’s Not All About AI In a recent post on resources for discovering podcasts, I noted that 2025 will be a year when those in the PR profession must reconcile the desire by clients for coverage in legacy media versus the potentially greater impact of a whole new cadre of earned media platforms. In the piece, I wrote: “There is nothing like a prominent Wall Street Journal or New York Times feature, let alone a six-minute segment on NBC “Today” or PBS “NewsHour.” But do these traditional media outlets move the needle as much as a widely followed social media star, top-rated podcast, or heavily subscribed newsletter? Could Joe Rogan have more influence than NPR?” It’s an important question for our times and the PR industry. The growing hegemony of podcasts, newsletters, and Insty, TikTok, and YouTube stars may prove more valuable than the productivity gains from AI and machine learning. A well-timed appearance on a top-rated podcast can have a greater impact than an ephemeral story in a paywalled legacy news outlet, with the last election being a primary example. In her Nieman Lab piece, “Podcasting Becomes the Primary Media Strategy, not an Afterthought,” The Podglomerate’s Joni Deutsch observed: “At a time where traditional media trust continues to hit historic lows, podcasts can help long-standing organizations establish stronger relationships with audiences and, in the process, drive real change in how people think and engage with the news.” For years, The New York Times set the national news agenda. A prominent investigative report or fawning profile could easily lead to a Congressional hearing or the A-list, respectively. And while The Times still sets tongues-a-waggin’, its paywalled content does not travel as far and wide as a top influencer’s social media post or podcast episode. Diminished trust in mainstream media is another barrier, but that’s a topic for a different day. These once-pedestrian content formats are truly ascendant with their ability to ratchet up digital eyeballs and a measurable increase in awareness, product sales, or even stock price. They have legs. It’s no wonder TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce. As for real-time platforms, Twitter once had the unique capacity to create national story memes, in part due to the myriad journalists and (actual) verified users who loitered and amplified on the platform. No longer. An Elon-remade Twitter has X’d into a cesspool of misinformation, conspiracy, and anger, e.g., Thus, many in the fourth estate have abandoned his propaganda machine and migrated to Meta-owned Threads, only to learn that its algorithm suppresses breaking news in favor of titillating content. Strangely, Threads also hinders engagement with others and now, along with its sister platforms Instagram and Facebook, will follow X into the fact-free zone under the guise of free speech. Most recently, BlueSky is enjoying its moment in the sun. Founded, but abandoned by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, this more civil platform has usurped both X and Threads as a safe , real-time resource for journalists. In December, it surpassed 25 million registered users. Don’t ignore it. Here’s a BlueSky post from Julie Brown, the Miami Herald investigative reporter who doggedly broke the Jeffrey Epstein story: Then there are the countless newsletters that regularly arrive in your inbox. They reside on self-publishing platforms like Substack, Beehiiv, or Ghost and often feature the work of prominent journalists, many refugees of big-branded legacy media who’ve forsaken their once high and mighty perches to go it alone. Lester Wunderman, eat your heart out. Some of my favorite newsletters include Casey Newton’s “Platformer,” Jedd Legum’s “Popular Information,” Oliver Darcy’s “Status,” Dan Perry’s “Ask Questions Later,” Taylor Lorenz’s “User Mag,” and any of those emanating from Axios, Puck, Semafor, or The Information. As for AI, make no mistake: we’re witnessing a whirlwind of promising use cases for PR practitioners. They range from analyzing a journalist’s past coverage before an interview to condensing a laboriously long media pitch to its “Smart Brevity”-style essence. Here’s a piece on one AI platform that I’ve found especially beneficial to the clients of my firm. What will not change for PR pros who compete in the earned media relations game is the requirement that they stay informed, inquisitive, and immersed in as much client-relevant content as possible, no matter how it arrives. Finally, as we head into 2025, I’d like to give a shout-out to some of the newer media outlets that have embraced quality journalism. Paramount among them is ProPublica for its essential, First Amendment-protected investigative reporting that holds wrong-doers to account. Happy New Year.

Title: How Biden Is Solidifying His A.I. Legacy in His Last Week as President

With less than a week left in office, President Joe Biden yesterday (Jan. 14) signed an executive order to streamline A.I. infrastructure across the U.S. Aimed at bolstering the country’s competitive advantage over the technology, the order earmarks federal sites for A.I. data centers built by private companies. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. “Cutting-edge A.I. will have profound implications for national security and enormous potential to improve Americans’ lives if harnessed responsibly, from helping cure disease to keeping communities safe by mitigating the effects of climate change,” said Biden in a statement. “However, we cannot take our lead for granted.” The order directs the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to identify at least three sites where the private sector can build A.I. data centers. Developers tapped for the land will have to pay for the construction and operation of these facilities. In a nod to the massive amounts of energy needed to power A.I. infrastructure, private companies developing on federal land will also be required to bring enough clean energy resources to match these data centers’ electricity needs. The A.I. revolution has spurred a dramatic rise in the energy consumption of such facilities, which accounted for 4 percent of the nation’s total electricity use last year—a figure that could more than double to 9.1 percent by the end of the decade, according to data from the Electric Power Research Institute. Speeding up A.I. data center development is also a key component of Biden’s new order, which urged agencies to prioritize “expeditious” permitting of A.I. infrastructure on federal land. Opportunities to hasten this process could include establishing “categorical exclusions” under the National Environmental Policy Act for infrastructure that doesn’t have significant environmental impacts, according to White House officials. The executive order came a day after the Biden Administration announced a new framework for the exporting of chips used to power A.I. products. In addition to placing further restrictions on exports to countries like China and Russia, the new rule calls for a 50,000-chip cap per country for most of the world. The rule, which cannot be enforced for 120 days, was met with pushback from impacted countries and major industry players alike. “We believe it is also in the U.S. economic and security interest that the E.U. buys advanced A.I. chips from the U.S. without limitations,” said the European Commission’s tech and security head Henna Virkkunen and trade chief Maroš Šefčovič in a joint statement. U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), meanwhile, called the framework “misguided,” describing it as one that “threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide” in a blog post. “We’re trying to strike the right balance between ensuring the frontier of A.I. stays in the [U.S.] and our close allies while also ensuring that the rest of the world can benefit from A.I. and get the hardware that they need to power A.I. applications going forward,” said Jake Sullivan, the White House national security advisor, while defending the A.I. chip framework in a press briefing earlier this week. “We think this is, in a bipartisan spirit, the way to best preserve and protect America’s lead when it comes to artificial intelligence.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. IonQ (IONQ) stock has slumped along with other names in the quantum computing sector following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in early January. However, despite the free-falling share price and cheapening valuation, I’m bearish. This stock rose on the expectation that a quantum revolution was potentially just around the corner, but the reality is that investors will need to be very patient. The stock still looks overvalued, and it’s operating in a crowded space, so not every company will make it. As such, I don’t think it’s time to buy IonQ stock. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener IonQ is a pioneering quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to develop quantum computers. Unlike traditional approaches, IonQ’s method employs lasers to manipulate individual atoms as qubits, potentially enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors. It’s all incredibly interesting, and judging by the company’s robust set of announcements towards the end of 2024, this approach has positioned IonQ as a leader in the quantum computing industry — at least among small caps. However, recent comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have sent quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, into a tailspin. During Nvidia’s CES 2025 event, Huang suggested that practical quantum computers might be 15 to 30 years away from realization. It’s a disappointing timeline, but likely the reality check that the stock market needed. Following Huang’s remarks, IonQ’s stock plummeted by around 40%, alongside significant drops in other quantum computing companies. The market reaction highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector and the substantial gap between current capabilities and commercial viability. One of the reasons why I’m bearish is because IonQ operates in an increasingly crowded quantum computing segment, where many companies are likely to struggle to survive in the long term. The quantum computing landscape is teeming with both established tech giants and innovative startups, all vying for dominance in this nascent field. With major players like IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) investing heavily in quantum technology, alongside numerous smaller companies like Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), the competition is fierce. The Gartner hype cycle suggests that while there will be winners in quantum computing, there will also be many losers — currently, we appear to be heading towards Gartner’s trough of disillusionment, which is a period after the peak of inflated expectations. Some firms will inevitably run out of funding as they pursue approaches that prove difficult to scale or simply execute their strategies poorly. This is particularly concerning for a company like IonQ, which, despite its innovative trapped-ion approach, faces significant challenges in commercialization and profitability. Furthermore, before the late 2024 bull run that preceded the free fall, pure-play quantum computing stocks were facing several challenges, including talent and funding. While IonQ’s cash reserves provide a decent runway, the company continues to lose money. However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials. As noted, IonQ is expected to remain unprofitable for a while, which reinforces my bearishness as it’s hard to construct a valuation-based thesis when profitability is so many years away. Despite this, its revenue projections are promising. The company’s revenue is forecast to grow significantly, with estimates showing a consistent upward trend from $41.6 million in 2024 to $314.6 million by 2027. This represents a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 96% over the four-year period. Due to this impressive revenue growth, IonQ’s forward price-to-sales ratios are expected to decrease from 167.9x in 2024 to 22.2x in 2027, indicating that the stock’s valuation may become more attractive over time. However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors. As a result, I’m going to look beyond analysts’ targets on this occasion. Sign in to access your portfolio

However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials. As noted, IonQ is expected to remain unprofitable for a while, which reinforces my bearishness as it’s hard to construct a valuation-based thesis when profitability is so many years away. Despite this, its revenue projections are promising. The company’s revenue is forecast to grow significantly, with estimates showing a consistent upward trend from $41.6 million in 2024 to $314.6 million by 2027. This represents a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 96% over the four-year period. Due to this impressive revenue growth, IonQ’s forward price-to-sales ratios are expected to decrease from 167.9x in 2024 to 22.2x in 2027, indicating that the stock’s valuation may become more attractive over time. However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. IonQ (IONQ) stock has slumped along with other names in the quantum computing sector following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in early January. However, despite the free-falling share price and cheapening valuation, I’m bearish. This stock rose on the expectation that a quantum revolution was potentially just around the corner, but the reality is that investors will need to be very patient. The stock still looks overvalued, and it’s operating in a crowded space, so not every company will make it. As such, I don’t think it’s time to buy IonQ stock. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener IonQ is a pioneering quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to develop quantum computers. Unlike traditional approaches, IonQ’s method employs lasers to manipulate individual atoms as qubits, potentially enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors. It’s all incredibly interesting, and judging by the company’s robust set of announcements towards the end of 2024, this approach has positioned IonQ as a leader in the quantum computing industry — at least among small caps. However, recent comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have sent quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, into a tailspin. During Nvidia’s CES 2025 event, Huang suggested that practical quantum computers might be 15 to 30 years away from realization. It’s a disappointing timeline, but likely the reality check that the stock market needed. Following Huang’s remarks, IonQ’s stock plummeted by around 40%, alongside significant drops in other quantum computing companies. The market reaction highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector and the substantial gap between current capabilities and commercial viability. One of the reasons why I’m bearish is because IonQ operates in an increasingly crowded quantum computing segment, where many companies are likely to struggle to survive in the long term. The quantum computing landscape is teeming with both established tech giants and innovative startups, all vying for dominance in this nascent field. With major players like IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) investing heavily in quantum technology, alongside numerous smaller companies like Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), the competition is fierce. The Gartner hype cycle suggests that while there will be winners in quantum computing, there will also be many losers — currently, we appear to be heading towards Gartner’s trough of disillusionment, which is a period after the peak of inflated expectations. Some firms will inevitably run out of funding as they pursue approaches that prove difficult to scale or simply execute their strategies poorly. This is particularly concerning for a company like IonQ, which, despite its innovative trapped-ion approach, faces significant challenges in commercialization and profitability. Furthermore, before the late 2024 bull run that preceded the free fall, pure-play quantum computing stocks were facing several challenges, including talent and funding. While IonQ’s cash reserves provide a decent runway, the company continues to lose money. However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials.

Quantum computing stocks continued rallying Wednesday after quantum-related announcements from both Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Quantum Computing stock was up by more than 55% at the market close on Wednesday. IonQ (IONQ) shares closed up by 33.5%, while Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum both saw shares up by around 22% at the close. The stocks climbed Tuesday morning after plunging earlier in the week and the previous week off of doubts by both Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced Tuesday that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Huang will join quantum executives from companies including D-Wave and Rigetti, the chipmaker said, “to discuss where quantum computing is headed.” Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said. Meanwhile, Microsoft released a blog post Tuesday calling 2025 “[t]he year to become Quantum-Ready.” “We are at the advent of the reliable quantum computing era,” said Mitra Azizirad, chief operating officer of strategic missions and technologies at Microsoft. “And we are right on the cusp of seeing quantum computers solve meaningful problems and capture new business value.” The tech giant also announced its Quantum Ready program to prepare business leaders for quantum computing opportunities.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates.

Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Netflix Signals No Change in 'Woke' Brand as Hollywood & Tech World Drops DEI Obsession for 2nd Trump Term

Netflix’s response to President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection victory is the scheduled premier of a documentary on Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, a symbol of Hollywood wokism. Netflix, a streaming service giant that openly works with the Obamas, does not appear to be willing to shift its left-leaning corporate scope following Trump’s reelection as did Meta and Amazon. With Netflix’s earning call set for the end of January, its investor relations team refused to respond when Breitbart News requested comment about whether it had plans to defund DEI programs, publish content more friendly to President Trump, or distance itself from the Obamas. Co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos’ apparent unwillingness to rebalance the company’s corporate scope stands in contrast to actions taken by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bozos. Meta shut down its biased fact checking program and added CEO of UFC and Trump supporter Dana White to its board. Amazon picked up the Melania Trump documentary. Before the November election, Bozos’ Washington Post refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris. “It is clear Netflix programming buyers at all levels have gotten an order from the top, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, not to touch content that is friendly toward MAGA or Trump,” said a producer with knowledge of Netflix’s political identity. “Other studios and streamers have publicly made a fast shift but Netflix execs at all levels are obviously scared.” Corporate shifts are common when political environments change. Just as DEI programs became popular after the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots that cost municipalities millions, companies like Lockheed Martin are announcing new government affairs personnel to work the incoming administration. Netflix’s silent position on the incoming administration is exacerbated by the streamer’s ongoing commitment to invest $100 million of shareholder money in DEI programs, CNBC reported: Netflix released a first-of-its-kind diversity study Friday to analyze the makeup of Netflix’s on-screen talent, as well as the behind-the-camera creators, producers, writers and directors. The report shows that the company has made progress, but still has more work to do to close diversity gaps. The company says it’s committing to an “inclusion lens” to its work, which co-CEO Ted Sarandos says means asking questions like, “Whose voice is missing? Is this portrayal authentic? Who is excluded?” The company also announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which will invest $100 million over the next five years in organizations that help underrepresented communities train and find jobs in TV and film. Netflix also committed to releasing an update on this study every two years through 2026. During the first years of the Biden administration, Netflix made overtures to conservatives by opposing authoritarian speech codes when it refused to cancel comedian Dave Chapelle on its platform. The decision helped Netflix steadily climb its way out of financial ruin in 2022. The streaming service’s stock price rebounded and experts project it to perform well into 2025. One of Netflix’s most anticipated projects this year is the release of a documentary on the Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, who is an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump. Netflix will also continue to work with the Obamas and their production company. “Netflix is proud to partner with Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions. Watch the acclaimed, award-winning movies and series they’ve brought to life,” the site advertises. Aligning with DEI, Netflix’s claims one of its values is “Inclusion — you recognize your biases and work to counteract them; you work to ensure everyone at Netflix can do their best work, whatever their culture, identity or background.” Netflix’s political corporate scope is amplified by their employees. Co-founder Reed Hastings reportedly donated $7 million to the Harris campaign. Nearly 100 percent of the Netflix employee donations, amounting to approximately $4.4 million, were in support of Democrats in 2024, according to Quiver Quantitative. “BI DEN,” Netflix’s social media head Lucie Zhang, who identifies as “She/Her” on LinkedIn, posted on X. Netflix’s vice president of inclusion Wade Davis II praised Michelle Obama’s DNC speech: “#MichelleObama brought both hands during her speech!!! Yes!!!! Let’s Go Kamala.” Trump won a landslide reelection in November with over 77 million votes, just short of Netflix’s reported 84.8 million paid streaming subscribers across the United States and Canada in the third quarter of 2024. The subscriber growth number slowed last quarter. This begs the question why Netflix would be exclusionary to this large audience. Following Trump’s victory, Sarandos, a big Obama donor, bent the knee and visited him at Mar-a-Lago, a pilgrimage several tech executives made, given the the scale of their business and the need to navigate regulatory hurdles. “EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND,” Trump posted on Truth Social after the meetings. What comes of it remains to be seen. Wendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst. He is the author of Politics of Slave Morality.

Title: Washington Post staffers urge owner Jeff Bezos to meet in scathing letter: 'We are deeply alarmed'

Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie has more on who will be in attendance and policies President-elect Donald Trump will enact during his first day in office on 'Special Report.' Hundreds of Washington Post staffers sent a letter to owner Jeff Bezos on Wednesday expressing grave concern at recent leadership decisions and the ensuing exodus of high-profile colleagues, asking for a meeting with the billionaire so the newspaper could retain its "competitive edge." "We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent," the letter obtained by Fox News Digital states. Alluding to Bezos' decision to quash the liberal editorial board's planned endorsement last year of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, the letter said this went far beyond that particular decision, which it called Bezos' "prerogative." "This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication," the letter states, reportedly signed by more than 400 staffers. "We urge you to come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at the Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in." Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 Live/posted by Andrew Ross Sorkin) ANTI-TRUMP COLUMNIST JENNIFER RUBIN QUITS WASHINGTON POST, BLASTS OWNER JEFF BEZOS The staffers also pushed Bezos to recall his words when he purchased the newspaper in 2013 and help reaffirm the "values" of the paper. The Amazon chief, who is one of the richest men in the world, had largely been hands-off with regards to the paper's editorial decisions. The letter appears to be the latest indication of a lack of faith by Post staffers in publisher Will Lewis, whom Bezos tapped to lead the paper a year ago. Bezos had already infuriated staffers in October with his decision to cancel the Harris endorsement at the 11th hour of the election, which Lewis supported. "It’s an implicit vote of no confidence in Will Lewis and a plea for Bezos' direct engagement and involvement," former Post media writer Paul Farhi told Fox News Digital of the letter, which was first leaked out to NPR on Wednesday. In recent weeks, the Post has seen the departures of such figures as reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and Leigh Ann Caldwell, columnists Jennifer Rubin and Charles Lane, health and science editor Stephen Smith and veteran editor Matea Gold.

"Corporate and billionaire owners of major media outlets have betrayed their audiences’ loyalty and sabotaged journalism’s sacred mission – defending, protecting and advancing democracy. The Washington Post’s billionaire owner and enlisted management are among the offenders," she wrote. "They have undercut the values central to The Post’s mission and that of all of journalism integrity, courage, and independence. I cannot justify remaining at The Post," she continued. "Jeff Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy – Donald Trump – at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracy’s survival and capacity to thrive." WASHINGTON POST BEGINS LAYOFFS, CUTTING 4 PERCENT OF WORKFORCE Andrew Ross Sorkin and Jeff Bezos speak during The New York Times Dealbook Summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Dec. 4, 2024, in New York City. (Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times) Editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members also resigned last year when Bezos spiked the Harris endorsement. The Post lost a staggering 250,000 subscribers over the move, which was viewed by staff as a capitulation by Bezos to Donald Trump before the election and a betrayal of the paper's values. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned from The Post earlier this month after the outlet refused to publish her cartoon depicting Bezos groveling to Trump. Former executive editor Sally Buzbee left the Post last June after Lewis' reshuffling of the newsroom. The paper has also been hit by recent headlines about huge declines in web traffic, a reported $77 million loss in 2024, and a round of layoffs earlier this month on its business side.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc (META): ‘I Find It To Be Little More Prurient’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The technology-focused nature of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg proved to be a boon for the stock in 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s shares ended the year 69% higher as investors were optimistic about its ability to monetize AI by selling features to advertisers. The firm also enjoys a strong moat in the AI sector as it has developed a foundational AI model. In 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s been in the news for scrapping fact-checking in the US and for Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Here's what Cramer said: "I know Meta AI is supposed to be the most exciting. I find it to be little more prurient. When it comes to the metaverse I thought that Ralph Lauren was supposed to have a mall right next to, I don't know, Macy's. Hasn't really turned out that way but at the same time the dialogue has switched mostly to Taekwondo and rifles. And David, you better start shooting pigs [referring to Zuckerberg's hobby of hunting boars] if you want to be on board here. Overall META ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: We Are All Going to Pay For the L.A. Fires

By Lois Parshley This article was originally published by The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever’s free newsletter. Over a year before Los Angeles’ uncontrollable wildfires burned through neighborhoods once considered safe, the office of California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara quietly shared a potential regulatory plan with insurance company lobbyists. It was a draft of reforms that would allow insurers to raise rates and pass costs on to consumers, among other industry-friendly changes, in exchange for little more than the companies’ word that they would cover homes in wildfire-prone areas. “What do you think of the language below,” one lobbyist responded, according to records obtained by The Lever, along with a detailed edit. “I am really trying to get them to a happy place,” she wrote, referring to her insurance-industry client. The changes the lobbyist suggested appeared to be included in legislation floated in September 2023, although the potential bill was dropped after an advocacy group leaked a recording of industry lobbyists loudly bragging about their role in the bill’s development. Several weeks later, Lara announced a package of executive actions that covered similar ground. “The current system is not working for all Californians, and we must change course,” said Lara, a Democrat elected in 2018 with the help of significant donations from the insurance industry. “I will continue to partner with all those who want to work toward real solutions.” Lara did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The emails are just one example of the conflicts of interest behind the reforms the commissioner has made to address California’s insurance crisis. As record wildfires flare up all over California, homeowners have faced skyrocketing prices, and many have found they can no longer find insurance at all. Meanwhile, insurers claim California’s regulations have kept premiums artificially low, and many are leaving the state. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The clock is ticking to find a solution, since L.A.’s fires, estimated to cost $250 billion in total economic damage, may bring the situation to a breaking point — with repercussions far beyond California. Many homeowners in the state have turned to an insurance program called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan. Created for people who can’t find insurance through the market and run by insurance companies under the commissioner’s oversight, FAIR Plan policies are often more expensive and provide less coverage than traditional plans. As private insurers fled California, the program swelled over 60 percent in the last year. It now has $450 billion in liabilities, though it only has about $385 million in funds to handle them. The outstanding balance, thanks to Lara’s recent deals with the industry, can now be passed on to homeowners. It’s a predicament that will likely soon occur all over the country. When state last-resort insurance programs can’t afford to cover mounting climate disasters, the recovery costs will be shifted from insurers to the general public, with potentially disastrous consequences. “These states are putting our national economy at risk,” says Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. The FAIR Plan’s vast liabilities are “a big gamble,” Victoria Roach, president of California’s insurer of last resort, told the state legislature last spring. The program, she warned, was just one major event away from insolvency. Related Content The Weeknd Donates $1 Million to L.A. Fire Relief After Canceling Rose Bowl Concert Insurance Companies Will Try to Exploit the L.A. Fires. We Can’t Let Them Los Angeles Wildfires: All the Benefit Concerts Raising Funds for Disaster Victims Taylor Swift Donates to L.A. Fire Relief Funds: 'So Much Suffering' “Are these wildfires that disaster?” asked Ben Keys, an economist and professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. As L.A. continued to burn, the FAIR Plan had an estimated $5.85 billion worth of policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood decimated by the fires — an area that plan administrators considered among its top five exposures to wildfire risk anywhere in the state. Preliminary estimates of the insurance losses total over $10 billion — although Keys expects the total to be far higher. How the FAIR Plan will cope is a warning for the rest of the country, where these kinds of state insurance programs have grown over 200 percent in the last five years. Many don’t have enough set aside to pay claims while taking on enormous risks. In the scorched concrete of the Pacific Coast Highway, where the flames ran all the way to the sand, the limits of what can be insured and what can be rebuilt are emerging with aching clarity. It’s an unwelcome, overdue reckoning. When the wind began on what was still an ordinary Tuesday, Jess Miller tried to reassure herself. She had lived all her life in Altadena, California, a diverse and picturesque suburb north of the city. Her mind instinctively jumped to fire, but she wasn’t especially worried about her own neighborhood. “I figured it would be like always,” she says, “something that would stay up in the mountains, and we’d be OK.” But around dinner, Miller looked out her window and was shocked to see orange flames. The heat rose to meet her when she stepped outside, thick and pressing against her face like a warning. “It’s like the fire could do anything,” she said. They weren’t in an official evacuation zone, but “we knew that it was just time.” She and her husband grabbed their five-year-old daughter and a few essentials and fled, swerving through choking smoke around cars that had been abandoned in place. That night, the house and a studio containing all of Miller’s art burned to the ground. Only the chimney remained. “There’s nothing left,” she says. “You don’t even think about the kinds of things that you grab until it’s too late.” Losing her house is not the end, but the beginning of a frightening financial journey. Miller rented from her father, who had purchased only nominal insurance coverage. Not only is he unlikely to be able to recoup his own full losses, but as a policyholder in the state, he’s on the hook to help bail out insurers themselves. In 2024, Lara made a big change to how the FAIR plan covered its vast liabilities. Previously, if a massive wildfire depleted the program’s funds, it could force private insurance companies operating in the state to cover the gap. But last July, Lara announced that in the “extremely unlikely event” this occurred, insurance companies could shift most of the costs to consumers — a tactic states like Florida and Louisiana have also turned to as their insurer-of-last-resort programs swell. Now, California insurers are allowed to charge half of the first billion dollars of any residential damages they’re asked to pay to policyholders — along with unlimited losses beyond that. With over 12,000 structures destroyed by L.A.’s fires so far, that “extremely unlikely event” is looming. The last time the FAIR Plan assessed insurers was after a 1994 earthquake that rocked L.A. — and almost all the insurers that provided earthquake coverage subsequently left the state. Lara has received significant contributions from the insurance industry, including $270,000 during his initial campaign for insurance commissioner as well as after he took office in 2019. During his reelection bid, he also accepted $125,000 from two LGBTQ groups after they received similar amounts from the insurance industry. (He previously accepted $65,000 of campaign donations from oil and gas companies over the course of his career as a state senator before rejecting efforts to require insurers to disclose their investments in fossil fuels.) According to emails obtained by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and reviewed by The Lever, in August 2023, Lara’s office shared preliminary ideas for passing insurance costs onto consumers with lobbyists representing the insurers that had backed his campaigns. The emails’ recipients included the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the California Personal Insurance Federation, and lobbyists representing insurance agents and brokers, which together have contributed at least $21,000 to Lara’s political coffers. “He’s made no qualms about developing his plan with the industry and being proud of that,” says Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog. Lara says the FAIR Plan changes are a necessary part of a series of regulatory reforms designed to help keep insurance companies operating in the state. Other reforms included permitting insurers to set rates by using private “catastrophe models” that factor in climate trends and in some cases walking back wildfire-mitigation discounts he’d previously introduced. In return, Lara promised that insurance companies would significantly expand their coverage areas in the state, insuring 85 percent of homeowners in wildfire areas. “For the first time in history, we are requiring insurance companies to expand where people need help the most,” Lara said in a December 2024 statement. “With our changing climate, we can no longer look to the past.” But the regulation’s fine print shows insurers actually have the option to increase their coverage by as little as 5 percent — and even that requirement can be excused if the companies claim they are unable to meet the condition after two years. Advocacy groups say the catastrophe models are expected to increase rates for many property owners, but the state’s Department of Insurance itself failed to conduct a cost analysis. California has hired just one person to oversee the accuracy of the new climate catastrophe models. Florida, in comparison, has a multidisciplinary team of experts to review catastrophe models and compare them to a public version developed by the state. “Administering the FAIR plan properly” would be just one reason for California to develop a more robust analysis, “rather than simply relying on not publicly transparent private-vendor modeling,” says Madison Condon, a professor of law at Boston University who researches climate risk in financial institutions. One of the first catastrophe models filed with the state this winter came from Moody’s RMS, a company that rates the financial stability of insurance companies. Moody’s largest shareholder is the massive holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Moody’s other top shareholders include financial services companies like The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. — who control substantial investment portfolios for insurance companies and who’ve both left a global agreement to fight climate change. “It creates a bit of financial conflict when the ratings company is selling the tools it wants insurers to use to set rates,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. Insurance companies may feel pressure to buy and use Moody’s model because they are dependent on the company for good credit ratings. If the model overpredicts risks, insurance companies can justify raising rates, increasing profits as well as management fees for BlackRock. “It’s an unvirtuous circle,” Balber says. Commissioner Lara has a history with Berkshire Hathaway. In 2019. Lara held a “relationship building” lunch with company executives benefiting his reelection campaign; after the meeting came to light, Lara was forced to return donations from executives of Berkshire Hathaway-owned companies. Lara later intervened multiple times — including overruling a judge — on behalf of one of those donors, the executive of an underwriting company then owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Not even the fiercest consumer advocates dispute that the climate crisis has radically reshaped the landscape of risk. Scientists say rapidly growing fires like the ones torching Los Angeles have increased almost 250 percent over the past 20 years. But “what the industry has done in California is take those real costs,” Balber says, and “used them to try and leverage deregulation.” There’s a lot of money at stake. Unaccounted-for wildfire and flood risk threatens as much as $2.7 trillion dollars in the U.S. housing market, says David Burt, founder and CEO of DeltaTerra Capital. He estimates that just under one in five homes nationwide are at risk. What to do about all of that unpriced risk would be much easier to figure out with more information. “What we’re missing is the kind of granular, localized data that would allow us to see the impacts on insurance premiums and claims in particular communities,” says Carly Fabian, policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. To understand potential disruptions in insurance markets, the Biden administration issued an executive order in 2021 tasking the Treasury Department and the Federal Insurance Office with collecting data on the problem. Insurance companies pushed back, calling it an “unreasonable burden.” The Treasury reversed course, accepting an anonymized subset of the data from state insurance offices — and even that has yet to be made public. “Right now, we actually have less information on insurance than we did about mortgages prior to the 2008 financial crisis,” says Fabian. Just how much insurers are currently losing responding to catastrophes is hard to pin down. There were 27 different billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. in 2024, trailing a record set just the year before. However, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the insurance industry still made a record $87.6 billion in profits in 2023 thanks to higher premiums — and was on track to make even more in 2024. When asked if California’s fires might result in higher homeowner premiums nationally, Fabian explained that insurers already regularly distribute costs. Because the industry is overseen by state governments, there are different rules for rate-setting across the country. Some researchers have found this leads to higher premiums in states with weaker oversight, regardless of the location’s actual risk. “If there isn’t strong regulation,” Fabian says, states are “just relying on a pinky promise that these companies aren’t going to price gouge a product that’s fundamental to the American economy.” She says greater transparency is essential to address the costs of an increasingly perilous world. Nowhere is that information scarcity more obvious than in reinsurance, or the insurance that insurers buy to reduce their own risk. An insurer that covers thousands of homes in a hurricane-prone region like Florida, for example, might take out a reinsurance policy that agrees to pay some of the claims if a storm triggers widespread damage. Starting this month, Lara announced insurance companies would be allowed to pass the costs of their reinsurance on to consumers. Records requests reveal the commissioner’s office hired a consultant from Milliman, a firm that works for the insurance industry, to draft the policy. The change also allows companies to increase their premiums through a calculation that includes catastrophe bond pricing, a volatile security market. There was no opportunity for public comment. In a study last year, Benjamin Keys of the Wharton School used mortgage data to compare insurance premiums across states, a workaround to the persistent information gaps that he says have “allowed a very opaque market.” He found premiums had increased by 33 percent since 2020, mostly due to higher reinsurance costs, along with inflation. Reinsurance is a largely unregulated global market, and insurance companies usually don’t disclose the terms of their contracts. But even with large payouts, reinsurers like Swiss Re and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group made huge profits in 2023 and 2024, with the industry’s total capital hitting a record $695 billion last year. That’s nearly five times more than the world’s largest oil company made in 2023. Passing on reinsurance costs has already contributed to the homeowners’ affordability crisis. Last year, a month after State Farm canceled 70 percent of its policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the company sought to raise its remaining premiums by 30 percent. While Commissioner Lara said the request raised “serious questions about its financial condition,” the company had quietly been buying hundreds of millions worth of reinsurance it didn’t need from its own parent company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. According to calculations by Consumer Watchdog, State Farms’s reinsurance costs were markedly worse than other large home insurers in the state. “The company is blaming reinsurance for its pullbacks in the market when we have clear evidence that it’s overpaying,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. State Farm did not respond to interview requests. Nevertheless, in September, Lara approved State Farm’s request to reduce the discounts it offers homeowners for wildfire mitigation and absolved the company from explaining to consumers what factors it uses to determine rates or how it decides whether to cover properties. Yet unlike private insurers like State Farm, the state’s FAIR Plan isn’t required to have the same reserves to cover claims. In public testimony last year, the FAIR Plan’s president told the legislature the program had only about $2.5 billion in reinsurance — which Los Angeles’ fire damage is almost guaranteed to exceed, many times over. Since insurers now have a cap on their obligations, homeowners will be stuck with the difference. If those costs balloon, Crawford asks, “Does the state bail out the FAIR Plan? Does the federal government get asked to come and bail out the states?” As last resort programs metastasize across the country, who’s on the hook to pay for climate damage, and under what conditions, should be decided before the eventual emergency arises. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2019, suggests one solution would be a federal reinsurance program, which could provide lower-priced nonprofit reinsurance for last-resort programs. It could be paired, Jones suggests, with federal low-income subsidies similar to the health benefit exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. California Sen. Adam Schiff (D) introduced an even more ambitious bill in Congress last year that would develop a national reinsurance program for all hazards, including for private insurers, in exchange for writing flood coverage that would eventually replace the troubled National Flood Insurance Program. Some kind of major shift in national policies is unavoidable, Jones says. “I do think that we are continuing to march towards an uninsurable future in this country,” he adds, “because we’re not dealing with the root cause of this problem, which is climate change.” It’s increasingly clear the center cannot hold: The odds of floods or fires are already driving down home values in the most vulnerable areas. Meanwhile, rising insurance costs have started to slow sales and cause price declines in risky regions, potentially leading to an escalating financial crisis. Markets like reinsurance may be repricing rapidly, Carnegie’s Crawford says, but other elements of the financial system, like mortgages and credit ratings, may not yet have adequately taken these risks into account. “These places of concentrated risk may, as in the subprime mortgage crisis, be places of concentrated defaults,” she says. Unlike foreclosed condos in Las Vegas, however, the effects of climate change aren’t going to be reversed. Altogether, Crawford says 17 percent of the country’s $48 trillion housing market may be at serious risk of fire or flood, putting the national economy itself at peril. Just this week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 400,000 mortgages in the South are underinsured against flood risk. As a result, Crawford is advocating for major changes in how the National Flood Insurance Program considers future risks and strengthening the program by making flood insurance an opt-out element of obtaining a mortgage, broadening the pool of people paying in. She also recommends incorporating insurance costs into buyers’ mortgage eligibility, which Freddie Mac started doing last year. Government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac help stabilize the housing market by buying and guaranteeing mortgages. Privatizing them, as conservative advocates pushed for in Project 2025, could quickly change how climate risks are priced. Currently, neither enterprise directly accounts for regional differences in climate risk, effectively subsidizing credit in vulnerable areas. That’s in part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have historically prioritized expanding housing opportunities. But privatization could lead to stricter lending standards in areas prone to disasters, like higher loan costs or more substantial down payments — making it cost more to get a mortgage in vulnerable places like California and Florida. Whatever happens to the country’s mortgage market, accurately pricing insurance may mean accepting that home values will decline as a result, Wharton’s Keys says. “The climate is just changing so much faster than policymakers are keeping up with,” Keys says, “and certainly than the pace at which the built environment can adapt.” Though many people in California live in unprotectable areas, a property value collapse there would likely have substantial effects on a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. “There are similar problems in Florida, Louisiana, coastal Carolinas,” Keys says, pointing to a December Senate report finding climate change is now driving a drop in insurance coverage nationwide, leading to higher prices. Any efforts to address these problems will have to balance short-term disaster relief with the unflinching reality that the climate risks are only going to grow. On Jan. 12, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) suspended the state’s environmental rules for rebuilding in the areas damaged by the L.A. wildfires to hasten reconstruction. But the move does nothing to address perpetuating unsafe land use practices or future climate hazards. “No matter what we do with emissions today, many of these changes are baked in,” Crawford says. Crawford grew up in Santa Monica, and even given her research into climate’s financial impacts, she was shocked to see that her childhood home was under an evacuation warning area during the L.A. fires. “Human beings are masters at self-deception,” she says wryly. “It is unthinkable that your neighborhood would go up in flames, that the place where you just walked your dog no longer exists.” But for Miller — who’s spending the shell-shocked days since losing her house trying to find a place for her family to live — and the other 180,000 people who were displaced in the fires, that unimaginable reality is here. Many of those who return to find their homes damaged but still standing are about to discover that their insurance won’t cover their repairs, says Dylan Schaffer, a partner at Oakland, California-based law firm Kerley Schaffer, which specializes in representing insured homeowners. Schaffer filed a class-action lawsuit last July against the FAIR Plan, alleging it has illegally limited coverage since 2012, denying thousands of families’ claims because it refused to pay for what administrators considered smoke damage. California law requires insurance companies to compensate property owners for “all loss by fire.” But Schaffer says the FAIR plan has been settling claims based on illegally restricted policies. In 2022, the California Department of Insurance itself concluded that FAIR plan policies weren’t meeting state requirements, identifying 418 violations of its insurance code where claims were improperly denied or coverage was impacted. In the two years since then, Schaffer says Lara hasn’t done anything to address the problem. Houses after fires are toxic, Schaffer explains: “Your neighbor’s house, with all its paint cans and televisions and toxins, burns down, and all that debris lands in your house, and the FAIR Plan’s position is, ‘We don’t cover this.’” Los Angeles was already facing a serious housing shortage. The city said in 2021 that it would need to add almost 500,000 units of housing stock, even before the fires wiped out thousands of structures. Without a functional insurance system to help people rebuild, the crisis will only deepen as displaced residents compete for a shrinking supply of affordable homes. “This is the point of the sword,” Schaffer says, “where climate change, economics, politics, and law all meet.” Though many of the houses lost in these fires were palatial — with values far exceeding the FAIR Plan’s $3 million coverage limits — historic Black and working-class neighborhoods were also destroyed. “Folks experiencing homelessness get lost in natural disaster,” says John Maceri, the CEO of the nonprofit The People Concern, an advocacy group working to help unhoused people find temporary housing and stay abreast of evacuation orders. Safe parking areas where people living in vehicles have access to restrooms have been burned out, he explains. Some of the people he helped this week find shelter off the street had been previously displaced by other catastrophic wildfires. Insurance, with its backstop of reinsurance, is a fragile scaffold on which lives are rebuilt, the mechanism that allows people to try to move forward and begin again. But while companies will eventually be spurred by bottom lines to account for climate risks, they are unlikely to consider equity in their response. That’s a problem, Crawford says, because “adaptation is a public good that won’t be adequately provided by the private sector.” While development prospectors may be drawn to cheap lots with a view of the Malibu hills, as homes become less insurable and services disappear, communities will weaken. In the scorched remains, property tax collection will crater, and municipalities won’t have the capital to rebuild infrastructure. It’s unclear how much even the houses still standing in neighborhoods like Altadena will be worth because of the destruction around them. Miller, for one, isn’t sure if she wants to come back to her burned-out home. She doesn’t ever want to be in that sort of situation again. Seeing the charred remains of the neighborhood she grew up in, “I’m homesick for the life I used to have,” she says, choking back tears. “I have to start all over.” We want to hear it.

Title: Snap, Meta Stocks Jump as TikTok Ban Approaches

Wall Street investors appear to be betting on Snapchat and Instagram benefiting from TikTok’s U.S. exile The stock price for Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, jumped 8.3% on Wednesday morning, while Meta’s share price increased 3.7% as both companies look set to benefit from TikTok’s looming ban from the U.S. Snap’s Wall Street surge pushed the company to $12.28 per share and a market cap of $20.5 billion. The Santa Monica-based company’s stock price has been on a roller coaster ride to start 2025, but following Wednesday’s early gains, Snap’s stock price is up 9.25% on the year. Meanwhile Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is trading at $616.29 per share and has a market cap of $638.4 billion. The stock jumps are likely tied to TikTok saying it would shut down its app this coming Sunday if a last-minute deal is not made to keep the app active in the States. ByteDance, The app’s Beijing-based parent company, is facing a Jan. 19 deadline to divest TikTok’s American assets. TikTok’s decision to shut down the app — which has 170 million monthly American users — goes one step further than the law, signed by President Biden last April, requires. The law bans new downloads from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play app store, and also makes it “unlawful” to update the app. In other words, existing users could keep the app on their phones, but it would never update. If TikTok turns off, Snapchat and Instagram would likely see a boost in users and usage. YouTube would also presumably benefit, and the stock price of Alphabet, its parent company, is up 2.3% on Wednesday. And Snap, in a timely effort to make it easier for users to find influencers on the platform, launched a “find your favorites on Snapchat” campaign on Wednesday. The law banning TikTok requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations to remain operating in States. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers say they have with TikTok is that it could double as a spyware app for the Chinese communist government; TikTok, per Chinese law, is required to share user data if asked to do so. In the days leading up to the ban, two Chinese social apps — Xiaohongshu and Lemon8, which is also run by ByteDance — have raced to the top of Apple’s App Store (You can read more about Lemon8 by clicking here). A potential TikTok ban has been lingering for several years now. Donald Trump first proposed removing the app from the U.S. during his first term in office before Congress ultimately passed the law banning the app last year. Despite his initial support, President-elect Trump has since changed his tune on banning TikTok, saying last year that he would like to “save” the app. And in December, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. The Supreme Court is currently weighing TikTok’s plea to overturn the law banning the app, but it does not appear likely before Sunday, when the app’s ban date hits.

The outgoing Biden administration is introducing even more measures focused on keeping advanced chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for artificial intelligence and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. “Advanced AI capabilities — facilitated by supercomputing, built on advanced semiconductors — present U.S. national security concerns because they can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of military decision making, planning, and logistics,” the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement. The new rules encourage chip producers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Samsung, and Intel (INTC), to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence to prevent advanced technology from getting to Chinese customers, Bloomberg previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The measures follow the discovery of TSMC-made tech in a cutting-edge artificial intelligence chip developed by sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei in October. According to the BIS, the new rules improve reporting for transactions with new customers who could pose a risk of diverting semiconductor components to China. Earlier this week, the U.S. published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia (NVDA), to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others. Meanwhile, the Netherlands released new rules aimed at Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML). Under the new export controls, ASML must apply for licenses with the Dutch government rather than the U.S. government to export certain measuring and inspection tools. The rules will be effective starting on April 1. China-based Huawei and its chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), depended on ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography machines to make advanced chips. However, the Dutch government restricted sales of this advanced tech to China last year, which has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment. China also cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make advanced chips designed by Nvidia and Apple (AAPL).

Title: Better Capitalism Will Reduce The Need For Unions

EVERETT, WA - SEPTEMBER 06: Boeing machinist Scott Green, with his son Joshua, 3,on his shoulders, ... [+] walks the picket line outside Boeing's plant September 6, 2008 in Everett, Washington. Around 27,000 machinists are striking from the states of Washington State, Oregon and Kansas as Boeing faces its second major strike in three years. (Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) One fascinating aspect of American business history is the pendulum-like swings in the attitudes of companies toward their employees, especially those who belong to (or wish they belonged to) unions. Every few decades or so, the pendulum seems to swing between hostility and collaboration, and the government tends to follow by increasing or decreasing regulations on the treatment of workers. The history of unions in America For instance, during the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, corporate owners had almost total freedom in their dealings with labor. Some spread the idea that most workers were lazy and didn’t deserve higher wages — an idea that justified strong resistance to unionization, by force if necessary. When the pendulum swung during the Progressive Era, reformers pushed the government to impose new rules that gave workers a better quality of life and a fairer chance at upward mobility. Unions began to gain more members and influence. As historian Heather Cox Richardson put it, “Prevailing opinion in the U.S. has seesawed between these two ideologies ever since.” She notes that from the end of World War I through the Roaring 20s, big business led a backlash against progressive regulations and a renewed trend toward laissez-faire capitalism. But with the Great Depression and FDR’s New Deal, most of America was again receptive to stricter business regulations and an improved social safety net for workers. The country became even more pro-union during the great post-World War II boom that lasted into the early 1970s. As Nicholas Kristof notes, “That was a magical period in American economic history, in which the economic pie grew rapidly and was also divided more fairly. Shareholders benefited, but so did workers, including African Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder.” Despite some corruption scandals and disruptive strikes during those decades, unions helped millions of workers join a broad and thriving middle class. As Kristof concludes: “Unions are as imperfect as capitalism itself, and just as essential.” The pendulum swung hard again in the early 1980s, when the Reagan administration promoted tax cuts, deregulation, and weaker protections for unions. As Richardson notes, “Those forty years, from 1981 to 2021, hollowed out the middle class as about $50 trillion moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%.” Private-sector union membership plunged from 29% in 1970 to about 6% today, contributing toward more extreme inequality. Kristof adds that “As unions declined over the past half-century, workers… were paid poorly, they lost health care and retirement benefits, and they lost control over their schedules. They were robbed of dignity and sometimes of wages as well. Deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol and suicide surged among blue-collar workers.” The prevailing corporate mindset in this era was “shareholder primacy” — the idea that management should focus on maximizing short-term profits and the stock price, and therefore offering unions anything better than market-standard wages and benefits was wasteful. In response, the prevailing union mindset was fiercely adversarial: us versus them. In the face of management hostility, why should labor care about any employer’s needs and priorities? Labor leaders won union elections by promising to drive hard bargains, threatening strikes despite any pleas from management about the challenges or hard times a company faced. Companies focusing on workers But now, slowly but surely, we see the pendulum starting to swing again. A new generation of corporate leaders increasingly recognize the downsides of shareholder primacy and the benefits of multi-stakeholder capitalism. Some companies are moving away from treating workers as replaceable widgets — as pure cost centers — and increasingly see them as the key to improving productivity and innovation, which are now the key drivers of long-term profit. Some notable examples in recent years include Delta Airlines, Home Depot, Costco, Best Buy, and JP Morgan Chase. One of my favorite examples is C.H.I Overhead Doors, a small Midwestern manufacturer of garage doors. The private equity giant KKR acquired it in 2015 and spent the next two years trying to win the trust and engagement of employees. KKR announced a stock ownership program that could give everyone a big payoff if results improved. They offered better training and began consulting workers on strategic decisions. They promised more trust and respect, in contrast to the old-school mindset of the previous owners. For a long time, C.H.I. employees didn’t believe any of these promises. But KKR kept at it, such as by polling everyone about how to improve the plant’s work environment and investing real money to implement the top suggestions (air conditioning and a better cafeteria). Over time, employee trust and engagement finally rose, and C.H.I was able to adopt the Japanese system of continuous improvement (kaizen). Workers became bolder about making suggestions and were rewarded for them. One major triumph was a new sequence for making and delivering garage doors, which cut the time from order to delivery so dramatically that no competitor could keep up, driving a significant boost to market share. Trust is key to a long term solution If a private equity firm (stereotyped as ruthless corporate raiders) can overcome employee skepticism and adversarial thinking, so can any company. The first move has to come from management to prove good intent. Talking the talk is easy, but only actions can establish an unwritten agreement, separate from any official union contract: if employees help increase the value of the enterprise, they are entitled to a significant share of the incremental new value. To help align everyone’s interests, management can adopt mechanisms such as restricted stock grants. PayPal used this to great effect. In response, unions need to accept that they will be better off if they work with management to make the company more successful — to make the pie bigger before lobbying for a bigger slice. They can refocus their approach from adversarial to collaborative, such as by offering new ideas to improve results. Unions can even offer to take a bigger role in strategic planning, to signal that they seek a voice in where the company is going, rather than merely waiting to execute directions from above. As we saw during the recent Boeing strike, not every labor conflict is primarily about wages and benefits. Boeing employees were furious that the C-suite had ignored their safety warnings until they escalated into fatal crashes. Had management trusted those with the clearest view of potential safety problems, hundreds of lives might have been saved — along with billions of dollars in penalties and lost revenue.

(Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) I’m not naïve enough to think that every company is ready to embrace this pendulum swing. Last year the Economic Policy Institute found that more than 60 million non-union workers wished they had union representation, and the NLRB received more requests for union elections than they have in years. In response to this surge in labor organizing, EPI recognized that some companies, like Microsoft, New Flyer, and Ben & Jerry’s, were receptive to more positive labor relations. However, “Others have taken the opposite tack—to the extreme. Led by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and joined by Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks, these companies are engaged in a legal battle trying to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional…. Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks have stalled the bargaining process—an all-too-typical move by corporations when workers first organize.” Nevertheless, I can imagine a future without unions — not because they’ve been crushed out of existence but because they will eventually become unnecessary. As more and more companies discover the enormous value of treating workers as partners rather than as cost centers, workers will increasingly reject the “us or them" mindset as counterproductive. We’ll see far fewer ugly strikes, more win-win collaborations, and more value for all stakeholders. And in that golden future, perhaps the pendulum will finally stop swinging. One Community.

Title: our CEO is demanding we return to the office but people don’t want to — and I’m a manager stuck in the middle

A reader writes: In 2020, due to the pandemic, my entire company started to work from home. I enjoyed a much better work-life balance and know many others did too, especially because so many people moved further away for more space. Sadly, we’ve been asked to come back into the office. At first it was a loose mandate, so people did it sparsely. I co-lead our department of 13 people with my boss, and at first we were pretty chill about it. Then the CEO started wanting people in three days a week, minimum. This caused backlash among the departments. We decided to try two days to try to be in the middle. We thought it was working well and had it going for a year, but with other departments doing their own thing too it became a problem. Some did the three days, while some did just one day. Recently, the CEO — upon hearing Amazon mandated everyone back in-office — sent an email: “Come in Tuesday – Thursday.” So we’ve told everyone the time has come to really stick to it. And it’s been … not great. We had a meeting to say we understand this isn’t what people want, so in an attempt to be flexible — because some people have meetings with international regions, which make some days really bad to come in when they’re on calls from 8 am until noon — we’ll let people come in other days, as long as it’s three days. Well, that hasn’t really happened. Local staff are rarely doing three days. Some reasons are understandable: they’re sick and don’t want others to get sick, children-related, pet emergencies, etc. But it’s getting to a point where the CEO is going to feel we’re disrespecting his mandate, and boom it’ll be a mandate for five days. Our HR head is checking our key entries. We got a list last week. This is a constant hot topic in senior leadership. The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again. Others, like me, feel it’s a step backwards to not see the benefits of flexibility or permanent WFH. Our jobs are very hard. I’ve never worked as hard as I’ve had to this past year, due to layoffs and terrible clients. It’s so demoralizing working until 11 pm sometimes and still be expected to be cheery the next morning in-office for the benefit of an out-of-touch CEO. He’s one of those “if I don’t see you working, are you working?” people. Plus, when we’re in the office, we all seclude to rooms for non-stop meetings. However, if I’m being honest, I do think some of our staff are too comfortable. Some don’t even show up in the office or give a reason. We feel a bit stuck. If we bring it up again, people will again spit out the reasons for opposing it. I do think some of those reasons are reasonable! And I also think some people are taking some advantage. I don’t want to care about this. Our team is built of highly functional workers. Many live so far that the commute is really bad (we do let people leave when they want so they can beat traffic). It’s really about tapping that key card for optics. And unfortunately there’s no “can you talk to people above again?” It’s been a discussion for three years now and in the end, what the CEO says goes. The answer is in your last sentence: in the end, this is the CEO’s call. As part of the senior management team, you can try to convince him that it’s in the company’s best interest to allow more work from home, but ultimately it’s his call — and it’s your job to be forthright with your team about that reality. I do think it’s worth coming to terms with what sound like some previous missteps. If the CEO wanted people in the office three days and your team compromised on two but even that wasn’t enforced and you’ve had employees not showing up at all and you thought some people were being too lax but you didn’t address it … well, it’s not surprising that your CEO is now responding with a firmer mandate. That’s not to say the CEO is right. For all I know, he might be; I don’t know your business or how hybrid work has played out there. And it’s possible it’s working for your team but affecting other employees in ways you don’t see (in particular, junior employees who are missing out on the learning by osmosis that happens when they share space with more experienced employees). But he certainly wouldn’t be the first CEO to cling to an old way of operating because that’s what he’s comfortable with, without recognizing that the workforce has changed, or that what technology makes possible has changed, or that what top talent in your field will demand has changed. And it makes sense to lay out for him your understanding of how a return-to-office mandate will affect the company’s operations. If you believe you’ll lose good people, struggle to hire the candidates you want, and generally be less effective as a result, you absolutely should present that case. But it sounds like you’ve done that, he’s heard you, and he’s still making a different call. Which he gets to do. If that’s the point you’re at, all you can do is to be very transparent with your team about the situation — about what’s being required, how much flexibility there is and isn’t, and the consequences if they flout that — and that it’s not about whether they’re right or not, but about what your company will and won’t allow. However, in order to do that, you need management above you to be clear about what consequences they’re truly prepared to enforce. If that conversation hasn’t been had yet, it needs to happen soon, so that you’re not managing blind. And who knows, maybe it’ll turn out that the CEO isn’t prepared to fire people who won’t comply, in which case you can decide whether you’re willing to just keep existing in a state of tension with him over it indefinitely and what that would mean for you/your team. But it sounds like it’s time to call the question: he wants everyone back in the office, people aren’t willing to do it … so now what? He needs to make that call, and then the answers for how you proceed will stem from that. Can we please have an update on this in six months to a year? I’m afraid the CEO will win and mandate back in the office for everyone. You will lose talented experienced workers and see a decline in productivity as you hire new less experienced replacements. FWIW: both my kids are WFH. They put in way more than 8 hours a day since the computer is right there and they keep working. I know this comment section will hate to hear it, but here goes. I’ve been working for 20+ years professionally. I’ve been in my current role for 7 years (but have worked at different companies). I am currently fully remote. I think there are DEFINITELY benefits to being in the office. Whether it needs to be 5 days is debatable. 2-3 though, I think is a good sweet spot. The fact that people are just flat out refusing to do so is done basically out of stubbornness most times, especially if they are local. In many fields, there are PLENTY of people out of work who are fine taking an in person role. And maybe the needs of the company and the employees are just at different places. The fact that you are framing this as the CEO “winning” is the wrong way to look at it. It seemed he tried to be pretty flexible with the 2-3 days, and people just flouted that. I’m not one to just follow blindly anything a CEO says. But I do think they have the authority to make those rules, and people can do it or leave. The benefits to being in the office depend on the details. This is where so many of these discussions fall apart, treating “work,” or at least white collar work, as if it were all the same. Yeah, that’s really the issue. So much of it depends on the nature of the work and the nature of the office. Long, long before the pandemic, my employer introduced a policy where you can work from home whenever you want, as long as you come into the office as and when needed. For people in my role, “as and when needed” ended up meaning 2 or 3 times a year, most often for just an hour or two. So yeah, automatically translating “sometimes it’s useful to be in the office” to “therefore everyone should be in the office 2-3 times a week” does not reflect reality. A good starting point is to look at what “as and when needed” actually looks like. the other hard part is “useful” can mean be useful to you, useful for your position, or useful to the organization more broadly. my job could be 100% remote but that is terrible for some discussions or for new employees or interns to get their footing for example The CEO is trying to define “Useful in that if I see someone at a desk (even if they are playing asteroids behind that spreadsheet screensaver) then I know they are working hard for my bottom line, but if I can’t see them they are probably goofing off: I have no other way to evaluate their work.” Which of course is unconvincing. Archivists, zoo keepers, plumbers, anyone who needs to physically intersect in space with another person: there are a lot of jobs that can’t be done remotely. But OP doesn’t seem to be in one of them, and so if management wants buy in, then it would help their case to not be declaring “But buggy whips! There was a time in this country our whole mission could have been making buggy whips, and we would make a profit, so why can’t we do that today?” Your formal notification that I will be stealing “But buggy whips!” as my shorthand for “lets cling to outdated technology and systems for as long as possible because I fear change”, henceforth. I am also calling Buggy Whips as the name when I start my all-women-steampunk-accordion-quartet. I read a few weeks ago that there is an expected pendulum swing of power back to managers. Not sure what that is going to encompass, but it might involve requiring more in office work and less WFH. People like WFH but bosses who are visually inclined feel slighted when there aren’t butts in seats. Yeah, when you have the majority of your people in-office but everyone is having meetings on Teams with people sitting right behind them, what are you even doing there? Or worse, I know people who are required go into the office to sit on Teams meetings with contractors doing work that has been outsourced to other countries. So you don’t even get the incidental benefit of running into your coworkers around the office. It’s especially demoralizing to realize the company is fine with people not being in person only when they’re outsourcing jobs. excellent points! That’s where my cynicism comes into play. Companies are paying for office space that is not being used, and they want to fill it back up. They don’t want to lose money on commercial real estate that is hard to unload right now (because of all the WFH). Aside from white collar work, I am seeing more and more small retail and restaurant businesses closing down. Entire shopping strips are empty. Yup that’s where I land too. They’re paying a ton for the office space, they want to see people using it. Even if it means they’re just taking zoom calls all day, aka working remotely from the office. This is more or less where I land, too. I don’t think I would want a fully remote role, so I appreciate the flexibility of going in once or twice throughout the week; and if something comes up during one of those in-office days, it’s not a catastrophe to my manager if I need to WFH instead. What I would also add is that I resent the fact that local leaders (at least here) lay this at our feet, instead of enacting policies or legislation that supports small businesses in town. Although I understand that COVID threw everyone in disarray, and we’re still picking up the pieces, it’s not my responsibility to prop up the local economy with a trip to the sandwich shop every day. And added to that, (in my corner of the world, at least) local leaders talk about the importance of people spending money downtown only in the context of requiring people to work in offices whether they need to or not. They’re not considering wages that keep pace with inflation (not even the wages of their own employees, where they could enact this policy with the stroke of a pen). They’re not considering doing anything about housing affordability. They’re not considering boosting social assistance rates. They’re not considering relieving student debt. They’re not considering affordable childcare. They’re not considering robust pensions. Not one single thing except requiring people to work in offices needlessly. And all THOSE things mean people are less able to or likely to spend money on a sandwich from a local cafe – they’ll pack their own to try and save money Yup. It’s not fun to pack food and haul a lunchbox back and forth. But you do what you gotta do. And they need to save money on lunch because they had to spend more money on their commute, whether it’s by car or transit This is the theory that this entire dreary argument is nothing more than a massive case of the sunk cost fallacy. There is a natural experiment already underway. Commercial office leases are long term, but they aren’t forever, and they don’t all end at once. Do companies’ attitude to WFH soften when their lease comes up for renewal and they have the opportunity to cuts costs? The extent that this happens tells us what was really going on, and also the extent to which the C-Suite does not understand logic. Of course this doesn’t apply to those big-name firms that built elaborate campuses back in the day. Those campuses will be an albatross for decades. My job just announced that we are letting go of some of our office space, presumably because our lease is up. This is great news for the majority of people who come in occasionally at best! My office is doing that too! We’re still hiring (2 to 3 people a month), still expanding *the work* but the physical office is shrinking by 40%. We used to have 4 whole floors of the building, after the remodel we will have 2 and a bit of a third floor. And we had record profits last year, too. my husband’s job who went officially fully remote, let go of 1/3 of physical office space, so it’s all mostly hotel desking for anyone wishing to come in …and now they announced back to the office mandate! x2 week if within 50km of the office Another conflating issue is that CEOs also often have investment in downtown real estate, and so stand to take a substantial loss if office culture truly dies for good. There’s some tangled incentives. My favourite is the companies that retooled their office space for a largely hybrid environment and are now demanding people come in even though there’s insufficient capacity to properly hotdesk. I know someone who was perched on a lunch table with no way to power their laptop Which is going to seriously impact the tax base for a lot of cities, since the valuation for taxes is based on what the property last sold for. I saw someone elsewhere theorize that cities are tying a certain amount of on-site presence to tax breaks in an attempt to drive traffic to downtown businesses. It’s the only argument I’ve seen that seems actually honest besides it just being CEOs all sharing the one brain cell. (So many of these businesses seem to be citing “everyone else is doing it” as their first and only reason.) In most places, property values are NOT based on the sale of an individual property, but on the median of a defined area over a statutory period. California is a notable exception. I’m in commercial real estate finance, and it varies from state to state. Some states, like Texas, are nondisclosure states where sales price isn’t public record. So it wouldn’t even be possible to set property taxes based on sales price there. That’s why there’s an entire industry built around appealing property taxes in Texas. Some other states, beyond just California, do set taxes based on the individual sales price (and others base them on aggregated prices over a set period, as you indicate). Whenever we get a deal in a state that we don’t work in often, one of the first things we have to do is to figure out how to underwrite taxes. But in any event, lower sales prices, whether on individual properties or as a market trend, will impact the tax base in many places. And lower market values will still impact the tax base in places that don’t directly consider sales prices. I think the office space of it is a thing. I have also seen many, many companies use this as an alternative to layoffs – you don’t have to file the paperwork that you are laying off a bunch of folks if they decide working in the office is untenable. But I also think that it is easier to create a company culture, onboard people, and keep people on the same page when you work together in space. It seems like for OPs job this might not be as good because they aren’t collaborating as much and there are big time zone difference, but in general… Onboarding remotely is rough. I’ve done it twice in the past (almost) five years. Some cultural norms, people, procedures, policies, etc., took me much longer to learn because I wasn’t on site. That being said, once it was clear that I was doing my job well, my boss was the one who suggested that I 99.9% telework (different than remote working for us). I’m on site today because I needed to have a discussion that took 25 minutes face-to-face. We needed to sit down together with documents, calendars, maps, etc. As much as I prefer teleworking, it’s not always the best approach to collaboration. We did one remote onboarding class and it didn’t go very well. So now our model is that you come onsite 100% for the first month of classroom, then follow the normal requirements beyond that. Shadowing used to be in-person only, but we figured out how to do that piece remotely and it’s been a definite positive! Yeah we make it that you need to be four days until you pass six-months probation and then you can make it three An awful lot of those places also sprang up in suburban areas though, too, with everyone WFH. But not every company is locked into their office space. My company was leasing their office space. After it was decided that we were staying fully remote, they talked to the landlord and got a sublet for the remainder of the lease and then didn’t renew the lease. They took the $500k they save each year on the office space and pay to bring us all together for a summit once a year where we basically get a free vacation so that we can spend time with our coworkers, especially the ones we don’t always get to talk to on a regular basis. Exactly this. There are days where it is to the benefit of my work that I be in the office; there are days where being in the office actively hinders my work. At my company, there are teams that all report in to one office and can collaborate in person; there are teams that have members spread throughout the country and collaborate through video calls. I’ve had team members who were caring for others and who needed to be flexible with their hours and put out amazing work from home; I’ve had teammates who struggled with this model and needed to come into the office. There is no one-size-fits-all. Appreciating the nuances is the way. Yes, our work can be done from a laptop and the really needed to be in person parts can be up to an hour from the office. It’s hard to schedule important business when we’re in the office for looks. When I started this job, working in the office was a punishment for a reason “The benefits to being in the office depend on the details. This is where so many of these discussions fall apart, treating “work,” or at least white collar work, as if it were all the same.” Seriously, even within the same company, it’s different for different departments and roles and individuals. It’s nuanced, and unfortunately, mandating X days in office is far easier than (a) identifying what is genuinely a business need that cannot be met with 100% WFH, and finding ways to achieve that while still affording people as much flexibility as possible; and (b) actually managing people as individuals who are either meeting or not meeting the particular requirements and expectations of their job, whether they are in-office every day or never. The thing that bugged me in my last job when back-to-office came up was: is anyone who wants to mandate in-office days actually going to do anything ensure these in-person days are worthwhile and accomplishing what you state are the goals of being in-office? I’m personally extremely pro-WFH, it works great for me, I’m more productive that way, etc. etc. BUT even I recognized that there were certain business needs at my previous job that were better served by in-person work. The problem was, no one was intentional about ensuring those in-person needs were being addressed on the days we went into the office. More often than not, in-office days felt identical to WFH days, the only difference being that we were all in the same room, and THAT is what is demoralizing about mandated in-office days to conscientious workers. Our senior management has been so tone-deaf about it. They’re talking about things like tacos and running into people in the elevator and bringing in treats! As if that’s why people choose to come into the office or not, and not things like weather and childcare and health concerns. This!! I am ferociously pro-WFH, but I also acknowledge there are certain things done better in person (training, team building, brainstorming, etc.). But does anyone actually ensure those things are happening in the office? Do people who take extra time to answer newbie/intern questions get rewarded, or do they have to make up that time later to get their “real” work done? Does management identify which departments need to work closely together and schedule their in-office days together? Does the office seating arrangement allow people to sit with their whole team, or are their not enough desks to go around? If I have to schlep to the office just to put on headphones and work on a computer, what is the point of being in the office? If the relationships I build over Slack are “good enough” and I’m not rewarded or recognized for doing more, why should I? Management needs to MANAGE, not just take away flexibility and assume things will follow suit. Can you imagine if they ran the rest of the business this way, they’d never make any money! +1. Our company has been dealing with something similar to LW for the last couple of years. We’re technically supposed to be in the office three days a week, but it’s never once been enforced and there are no consequences for people who choose to WFH almost exclusively. However, we have one team that is made up almost entirely of new graduates in their first jobs, and their managers do require them to be in office multiple times a week. It’s been great for them to learn from one another, take part in trainings, develop relationships with their managers and peers, etc. The teams with more experienced staff don’t have the same needs and thus less of a need to be in person as often. Its two ways as well – sure as an employee I enjoyed ditching the commute a couple of days a week and being able to focus on dep work at home but also the slackers on my team became far, far harder to manage. So as an enginer part of me is in camp ‘who cares where you do asynchronous work from’ but as a manager… ugh… can I just make the bottom 30% of performers come in? Per usual a few ruin it for everyone else. The thing is, you don’t have to be WFH to do bupkis – plenty of problem staff seem to be as adept at it whether butt in office or not! But for sure, WFH isn’t a great fit for everyone, even if “on paper” the job can be done just as well from a home rather than central office. Some people’s homes aren’t less distracting. Others may need the “organizational cues” or other external supports an office environment provides. It is certainly more than reasonable to make WFH contingent upon meeting whatever metrics of production, communication, and availability make sense for the position. I think that’s a tool managers really should have the resources and standing to use when needed. My employer makes it clear in the handbook they support hybrid and remote positions, but that under-performance is one of the grounds which a manager may use to reduce or eliminate remote hours. Same for flexing your hours. I knew who the slackers were in the Before Times, and they were all in the office. My old job started remote work years before the pandemic to save costs. One site was closed and everyone went remote or took severance. Our location moved to a smaller site and they wanted/needed to get roughly half the people to go remote or hybrid via desk sharing. One of the primary requirements was you could not be on a PIP, or responsible for child care/elder care, and had to be a good (or at least, above average) performer. Managing a team should definitely involve a lot more than checking to make sure people are there every day. OMG yes. Just because your job has benefits to RTO doesn’t make it universally true. I don’t mind going into the office. It’s a change of scenery, it’s comfortable and it forces me to exercise. Now that my work consolidated offices it’s less isolating as I actually see the odd person (previously I was going in once a week to hang out as one of a handful of staff in an office meant for two hundred) However, some weeks I do not have time to get my work done and go to the office. Literally none of my team is in my city. More than half aren’t even in the same time zone. We work together very effectively, but in office days cause project delays (because we have to wait for transit time), meetings are more frequently disrupted and quality of work is slightly less due to distractions. The mythical junior team member that would benefit from mentoring? Doesn’t exist. And anyway wouldn’t be in my city. There are other people in my building and maybe some are new to the workplace but I don’t know what they do or anything about their completely different projects. We don’t even work for the same client. Most folk in my city work for a variation of llama grooming while I’m painting teapots. Aside from our benefits plan and payroll being the same I’d have as much in common with a random person at a coffee shop. If this is what you want to pay me for, ok. But I find it enormously frustrating when the powers that be decree that we are doing RTO because it’s somehow “better” and are utterly unable to make any kind of coherent and relevant argument as to why. OP’s CEO sounds like could be mine, actually. My managers have been very much, this doesn’t make sense and we don’t see a strong reason to enforce except for CEO. Trying to be flexible makes staff feel like it’s not a completely serious ask. At my company many colleagues have said straight out that they don’t plan to comply until it’s strictly enforced. Some have plans to leave once enforced. I don’t get it. To me it’s like companies are struggling to adapt to our changing world. Yeah data shows hybrid being best for the majority of offices. It also depends a TON on what the work is. Working in nonprofits, we tend to have work that is high touch, and real-time collaboration and the social support that comes with in-office work is demonstrably tied to both our retention and the learning and growth of our employees. People doing tech support likely feel differently. But one is not inherently better or more evil than the other. Still, if these people don’t want to work in person, they might leave. And they’ll be replaced with people who are fine working in person. Less than 10% of jobs in the US are fully remote, most workers are on a spectrum from “tolerating in-person to work” to “preferring in-person work”. It’s fine to decide a certain office set up isn’t working, and sometimes the transition is tough but it typically works out. Yeah, but what happens where there are no remote-only jobs left? Because that’s where the CEO’s are going. It’s where SOME of them are going. Remote work trends started many years before COVID, the pandemic only accelerated the trend. The toothpaste is not going back in the tube. Remote only jobs will never disappear, because it and hybrid work makes a lot of sense for many jobs. Not just for employee morale but also for lower costs, greater flexibility, and reduced costs. Right. I was watching for that pendulum to swing back sooner than it did, but the tight white-collar labor market lasted longer than expected. Now, however, there’s little to stop the one-size-fits-all stupidity from being imposed again. (I give thanks to the non-stupid employers!) it also matters where the people are. My company is national and 90% of the people I work with are in another state. The only people local are a team that I’m a subject matter expert for so they get to interrupt higher value work and ask questions that can easily wait until end of day. Yeah – I think this OP honestly is just tired with the job overall and this feature of it has made managing really unpleasant. Where they might ultimately be happier working somewhere that has a more rigid in office mandate, or even in office 5 days a week, if their overall workload reduces and this tension doesn’t exist. My supervisor recently took a new job that has mandatory in-office I believe 4 days a week? She basically hated how unsupported our overall remote work structure was, particularly for her as a manager and didn’t like working so removed from people. And now she has a new job where that won’t be an issue. I have a friend physically relocating to a new state so she can be in-office at her current job more often because it’s what she wants for her career. Her employer didn’t make her, but was happy to help her financially because they agreed it would help her growth in the company. I think we hear a lot about the pro WFH people – and even folks like my former supervisor isn’t looking for a completely inflexible structure – but I think it’s shrunk the view on how many people actually prefer in office/near team work at least part of the time. For those of us who can do our jobs WFH, no one I know wants it to go away entirely. But I think that’s very different from the people who want the ability for full time WFH. Yeah, I’m very happy that my job literally can’t be done from home because I would absolutely hate it, both for productivity reasons (I’d be distracted by the countless stuff I could be doing at home) and for “psychological” reasons (I want my work and personal life to be as separated as possible which would be hard for me if my home were also my workspace). We exist! Totally. I run a relatively ‘young’ office (nobody over 45, and all staff but two of us are in their 20s-30s) and I am the only one who doesn’t prefer being mostly in office. This is me. My job has very little that can be done from home, but the job I was working at during the pandemic did (with some necessary alterations). I found out during the pandemic that I hated working from home and only connecting over Zoom. Even if my job could be done remotely, I would probably prefer coming in over not. I was probably the same amount of productive between WFH and in-office, I just hated not being able to “turn off” when it was time. My job (apart from a few months a year) could be done almost solely from home, but I come to the office almost every day, largely for the same reasons as you. As well as this, our office is in a space close to a lot of companies we collaborate with, and I like seeing people in person when the opportunity arises. Sometimes the meeting *can* be an email, but sometimes literally sitting with someone with a coffee and talking through a bunch of things is really good, and I’ve found that dynamic really hard to replicate remotely. Also, the commenters here are especially pro-WFH. Either that, ot the pro-wfm commenters here are just more outspoken about it than those who prefer working in-office. Hard to tell for sure! Personally I think hybrid is a really great option. My workplace has us come in two days a week, usually the same days a week but with some flexibility for other reasons. I think it’s really helpful to be able to connect with coworkers in person while also having the benefit of flexibility if you need it. I don’t necessarily want to go back to a full in-person work environment but I don’t want to go back to fully remote either, I think hybrid is a really great balance. This is me. Currently I live in the same city as a location of my employer, but the reality is that I’m the only person in my entire department who’s based in this city. So while I do go into the office occasionally – my work reality is that while my team has a lot of remote people – the city where there’s a concentrated group of colleagues isn’t where I am. I don’t always dislike the situation, but I also don’t love it. And while that alone wouldn’t be a reason to take or decline a new job – it’s not a situation I’d actively seek out. Going to a place with that set two or three days in the office sounds a lot more appealing to me, even if it would mean giving up some of the flexibility I currently have. I’m in the same boat (department in another city), and going in seems useless sometimes. Especially when it’s nasty outside like today. I’d just as soon stay home. It was the same with ExJob right after I moved, but then they switched me and the person who was doing the local stuff (she was remote), and it made a HUGE difference. When I started actually working with my in-person colleagues, I suddenly wanted to be in the office more often. I hope I get put on some things here, but I doubt that will happen since I’m only one of two people supporting the unit in the other city. Hi there, I’m the OP! It’s quite true that I’m very tired with the job overall, that seems to have been easy for people to pick up (even though that wasn’t the reason for writing the letter, heh). Though, just wanted to mention your specific comment that nope, even if I went somewhere where I really liked the work, I can honestly say I wouldn’t want to be in-office 5 days a week. When we went WFH during COVID, the freedom to use my time more efficiently for myself (like during lunch hours) and hyper-concentrate without distraction was so wonderful. When they mandated going back into the office and I started going in the 2 days, it wasn’t my ideal situation but after a while I got used to it. I felt 2 days was a good balance because I didn’t have to reset too much from my established routines. At 3 days, it’s robbing more than I would like. I get lonely being alone at home, single no kids, and one bedroom apartment. Instant messaging doesn’t replace human connection, I’m sorry. I don’t think it should be all 5 days in office, even before COVID my job let us have one day at home. But there needs to be a balance somewhere. If I didn’t do Toastmasters outside of work, I’d be completely lonely. Also I’m being laid off soon and looking for a job that is hybrid or in-office because of the loneliness. I’m single, with a kid and pets, and I vastly prefer to be in office. My work-life balance suffered so much working from home during COVID. I would agree. I prefer to be in the office some of the time. Being at home all the time isn’t good for me and I don’t work as well that way. Also the flat is really small and I feel so confined if I work from home more than 1-2 days. Covid was really hard for my mental health because in addition to working remotely all my usual social outlets were shut, no dances, no spas, no recreation and minimal shopping. I was so glad to get back to the office 2 days per week. I’m currently in a secondment role in the company I’ve been at for 7 years, and they offered to extend the secondment for another 9 months (been doing it nearly 2 years already, including a 1-year extension). I declined, partly because I’ve come to dislike the company’s setup of ‘work from home by default’. I’m normally in the office 3-4 days a week but the rest of my department are barely in once a month. Yes, I can talk to people in other departments, but only seeing my immediate colleagues 10 times a year isn’t great. Funnily enough, my original job at this company was literally impossible to do from home, which meant we were the only team in the company working in the office for about a year from March 2020, in an office which previously held about 300 people! As much as I’m not too keen on the work, the fact that I will see my colleagues every week (actually every day, but weekly would be fine) has tipped the balance in favour of going back to the original job when my secondment ends! A lot of that depends on the availability of reasonably priced childcare, though. I’m just the same! I haven’t had a kitchen table in five years because my computer and monitor is there. I’m currently looking for a job but the best part of my last job were my colleagues and working together with them. My ideal job would have flexibility to WFH a couple of times a week but I’d never want to be fully remote. It makes me miserable. The discussion about WFH vs Office isn’t about “balance”. It is about letting adults work in the environment that best fits the company’s needs and their needs. If the needs of the position don’t require being in office, then don’t force it. In your situation, it is about you finding a position in a company where the culture meets your needs. Wanting all employees to return to the office, even on a hybrid schedule, because it balances your need for socialization discounts all of the employees who are much more productive and effective WFH. People who need in-person socialization should not expect all those needs to be met at work. A person who needs that should find ways to get it outside of work. If not you’ll be a person like my boss, who puts her social needs first and is best friends with one of her direct reports. Not a good thing, for her or anyone else. I couldn’t agree more. I totally see how it’s more pleasant for some people to come into the office because they get to interact with other people. If that’s you, then go in as much as you want. No objections from me. Where I take issue with it is when that translates into me having to spend 90 minutes commuting and losing an hour of sleep each day I have to come in. Especially when I had a job where the project teams my colleagues and I worked with were spread out all over, so there were a million conference calls. Which would have had to happen at our cubicles. The distractions would have driven me to drink (and harmed my productivity). Anyway, it’s incumbent on all of us to figure out the level of social interaction we need to be happy and come up with our own plan to make sure we get it. I like the in-person socialization in the office! But it is utterly antithetical to the focused knowledge work that comprises my core duties. And I cannot switch between the two modes on the fly, not since long covid. I tried it for a year and it shredded my brain. Our org is pushing hard for 50% (which is hugely unpopular). The line I drew with my doctor is that I need a quiet, private environment in order to take calls, and my desk is… the exact opposite. Tomorrow is my meeting with HR to hash out the details and I am not looking forward to it. Good luck! I ended up getting a job where I have a lot more interaction with people, and that helped a lot. In the previous 25 years I had developed a social life outside of work, and that helps too. So I’m not like my boss. :) I think the point I was looking to make about there being a group of people who enjoy being in the office/more of the hybrid model isn’t to take away anything from those who prefer fulltime WFH. Rather it was to pushback that CEO’s/employers who change from a completely flexible WFH schedule are going to lose lots of talent AND won’t be able to replace them. I think it’s a false premise that right now everyone fussing about WFH is coming from the same place of not wanting to come in at all. A lot of people who dislike coming into the office don’t like it because none or few of their teammates are there – whereas a more rigid requirement would make those people happier coming in. Similarly, if one team has a very rigid approach and a team they work with doesn’t – the implementation feels unfair and that inevitably causes displeasure. The other point, is that there are people where this hybrid policy sounds great – and would be happy to apply for the positions of those who do leave. At some point this CEO is either going to make a more concrete decision that will significantly upset some and not others or will continue to operate in this middle space which will largely irritate more people and keep them in limbo. It’s funny, I have a completely different perspective on this. I feel more cut off from people spending the day alone in a grey box in the office than working alone at home. A few good mornings or nice weather exchanges with random people in the elevator or hallway aren’t enough payoff for the effort of commuting. Same. When I work in an office, the quasi-social interactions all felt really draining. I never expected or wanted my social needs to be met at work, but something about the “work in the office to connect with others” felt fake, forced, and unnecessary. Yeah, I spent the first 14 months of the pandemic living alone in a studio apartment. the loneliness was awful a lot of the time, especially in the winter when it was less pleasant to do things outdoors. Then I moved to a 1-bedroom apartment for a while, which helped because I wasn’t so cramped, but still wasn’t great. It wasn’t until I started dating my then-boyfriend that things started getting beter. Weirdly, I used to get lonely in my open-plan office. Everyone was trying to concentrate and there wasn’t any white noise, so 40 people could hear your whispered conversation or squeaky chair. It felt like everyone was looking at you but you couldn’t talk to anyone, all day, every day. The reason the extremely profitable company built the office open plan instead of with cubes or offices? “To encourage spontaneous collaboration.” I’m sorry but this is very ableist. Online friendships are very fulfilling and are human connections. Especially in an ongoing pandemic. Online friendships saved me when I was bedridden for a year bc of injury. I admit, my emotions are pretty raw right now, my online friend of 5 years died yesterday. At the same time, just bc you consider IMing not human connection doesn’t mean it’s that way for everyone; especially those in the disability community. WFH has been immensely important for accessibility and to have it torn away has been detrimental especially bc others only think face to face is socialization. I’m sorry you’ve been lonely and I do hope things get better for you. It was essentially Among Us that saved my sanity when I was bedridden for months from a major injury. No joke. The shift to online communications for work stuff during the earlier years of the pandemic is directly responsible for a work-friendship blossoming into my current closest friendship, period. (In fact, that person isn’t even a co-worker anymore, but the shift happened when they still were one.) Feedback I’ve given to my employer on surveys, etc., about work culture, hybrid/remote work, and related stuff has included reminding them that because of life circumstance, health, neurotype, and many other factors, the assumption that face-to-face interactions are the most effective and impactful is outdated and was probably never accurate in the first place. Folks who rise to leadership positions in companies tend to be those who are good at the face-to-face schmoozing stuff. Of course they tend to value that more, and assume that it is the superior way to connect to people, and that it is some objective truth of the world for everybody and every situation. I’ve noticed that many of those people are often lacking when it comes to written communication – they miss important details in emails sent to them, they have trouble asking and answering direct questions, and don’t know how to and/or want to use the tools available to them to refer to information they have already been provided in writing. And this is something that I’ve noticed starting well before I ever did any WFH work — I think a lot of it comes down to folks in leadership/management positions not really getting what the day to day work is like, and overly-relying on generalities and glossing over the details. That’s easier to do in a model where it’s talk talk talk, and harder to get away with when there is the possibility of detailed communications in writing that one can take their time to compose and refer back to indefinitely. For many of us, the divide became a lot more apparent when, for a time, there was a shift to more written communication for everyone. With all due respect, work is not your social life. It can be a part of it, sure, but wanting everyone to come into an office if it isn’t warranted for work just because you’re lonely is the wrong solution to your problem. I think you are putting words in the mouth of the person you’re replying to. right but if the rest of your department is just fine WFH, should they come in just to hang out with you? or maybe you need to build social circles outside of work and not use that as a crutch? ?!? have you tried hobbies? Community? Friends? Working at a coffee shop? It’s not healthy to rely solely on work for all of your social emotional needs. This is where I’m at TBH. And I’m kind of agreeing with this part too: “The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again.” In the sense that like, yeah they’re not wrong? Not every job can be done remotely (at least not fully remotely) and people for the most part took those jobs knowing full well they were in-person roles with in-person expectations, and dealt with it. For years and years. So to be all “well how can we ever be expected to leave our houses????” now is a bit disingenuous, to me. And ultimately this is the CEO’s call so the OP and colleagues have to decide if this is a huge deal breaker I did 5 days in the office for 2.5 decades. Except it stretched me so thin that I was perpetually sick and would eventually have to take FMLA leave just to let my body recover. I have taken FMLA four different times at three different companies, and the medical reasons were all due to lack of sleep and lack of time to fully decompress from a stressfully hazardous commute (up to an hour each way) and 9-11 hours a day in an office building where I had to be “on” for every single one of those hours. Since COVID and WFH for the job I had at the time, and then taking a job that is remote, I haven’t had to take more than 2 or 3 sick days in almost 5 years, and I sure as heck haven’t taken any FMLA time off. So, yeah, some of us did it because it was the only way to get a paycheck, but it was highly detrimental to our physical and mental health. Exactly. I worked from an office for about fifteen years because that was the only option. Now that there are companies with other options, I take them! I’ve been fully remote for five years and I could not imagine having a commute and being “on” at an office all day ever again. I’m home sick right now. For the third time in two years, I’ve gotten a secondary infection after a cold. I’m sure I would be healthier if I didn’t have to commute to the office five days a week. Even though I like my job, I’m starting to wonder if I should look for something that’s remote or hybrid or at least has a better commute. Agreed. I had a similar schedule for 8 years (while having babies!) and it was exhausting. WFH has been a lifesaver. Same here. I took my first ever sick day at my current job (100% remote) after over two years working here, whilst at other jobs, I was out three or four times a year. One of my coworkers has a disability that our office building is not just not adapted for and which my employer refuses to update. (A years-long argument over whether a button-open door was necessary for our department door was only resolved when he was trapped inside the room during an unscheduled fire drill.) He still cannot use the elevator or reach the “handicap accessible” soap dispenser. Still, up until the COVID pandemic forced us all remote, he was never allowed to WFH as a reasonable accommodation. I’m concerned that these “return to office” pushes are going to screw over my coworker and others with less visible disabilities who have been able to work much more efficiently because they have the accommodations they need at home and don’t have to make a stressful commute (often dependent on an unreliable paratransit system or painful). This is me. I’m at a point where I need to WAH 99.9999% of the time if I’m going to work thanks to the confluence of several different disabilities. I was working effectively 100% remotely for several years before the pandemic and I am concerned about any future job search in this now hostile environment. As someone who works a job that is impossible to do from home, the way WFH people talk about it is a little grating lol. Agreed. Unless you’re at a specific exec level/positions – there’s no WFH for my industry. Which is fine as I chose this as my career and I like my work but the tantrums some people are throwing about a hybrid schedule are getting old. That sounds like “My job requires me to wade in raw sewage, so everyone should have to take a dip in sewage too.” If a job does not require you to be physically hands on, it should be open to hybrid or remote. This “Since my job is impossible to do from home no one should be allowed to work from home” crap is really petty and bucket crab-ish. If you don’t want to have to work on-site, but your field is one that requires it, then it is on you to change fields. It is NOT on others to take on wasteful commutes just to sit in an open-plan noise pit on Zoom all day just to make sure that they have it as bad as you do. Where did you get “My job requires me to wade in raw sewage” from “I chose this as my career and I like my work”? I can be silly and hyperbolic too. All of you complaining about not being able to work from home sound like you’re being asked to walk barefoot through broken glass every day. Get a grip. Pretend that said “sit” and not “sick”. My brain has not been working today. I’m not sure what people were promised when they started the jobs mentioned above, but a big issue is that if you sign up for a job expecting to be solely WFH or hybrid, and the rug gets pulled out from under you after years, it’s pretty normal to be upset. I’m not sure your industry or schedule, but imagine being hired and told you won’t work weekends/holidays/insert something else, until several years down the road and suddenly you’re told, “Eh, well actually, you need to work holidays/weekends/whatever after all.” Wouldn’t you feel at least a little upset, since that had not been the agreement when hired and you now have to give up something that you thought had been agreed upon when hired? That’s what’s happening with a lot of people. Also, as someone who currently works an industry where working from home is possible and fairly common, but at one point worked in an industry where it was not possible, I get not being able to work from home and having to drag yourself to a job when scheduled. On the other hand, my career was full of choices. I chose to make a shift in both industry and company specifically for the flexibility. I will also self-select out of jobs that never allow WFH (or where the pay is too low, or the PTO is awful) etc., etc. I could choose to work in an office that requires me to be in office 5 days a week, or an office with a higher pay but poor work life balance, but I choose not to. What I’m getting at is that ultimately, it’s all choices. If I still worked retail, or had chosen to be a police officer, ER physician, paramedic, whatever, it’s known that a position like that comes with crazy hours. It would be wild of me to complain about office workers for choosing to work a 9 to 5 when I had chosen a job with known crazy hours. Yes, this is a worker’s rights issue. It’s like starting a job and finding out you are expected to work longer hours or weekends with no extra pay. You’re just doing that commuting instead. “Impossible” work from home role was your choice. Funny how many people are being told “you must be present in the office” are also expected to also “and you must respond immediately at 3am to an emergency call and address the issue remotely”. Roles that “cannot” WFH have no part in this conversation. This is exactly why people who can’t WFH roll their eyes at these conversations. Comments like this. Also, it’s funny you assume that people who can’t work from home also must automatically work in an office and are never called at 3am to address issues. I made no such assumption, I pointed out that if we can work remotely when needed, then there’s no valid argument for must work in the office. If an ER Surgeon complain that he can’t work from home? Sorry dude, this isn’t your conversation. “I chose a must be in person role” people do not belong in this conversation. Retail is a thing, my friend. So what? That was your/their choice. Doesn’t mean you get to complain that those that can work from home are being told not to. And it’s also not my problem or role to go to an office just so your retail stand or restaurant can get more custom. Go on about how taking a retail job to pay my rent and then finding myself stuck here 5 years later, at least partially because of the pandemic, is a choice please. I actually really do feel for people who were originally promised remote/WFH when they began their jobs to now have that benefit being taken away from them, as I feel for every worker who loses benefits that they accepted in good faith when they took a job or when their job went remote. I also feel like sometimes people forget that there are still positions that can never be WFH/remote – and here’s the kicker – don’t respect them. As someone further down in this thread said, it does sometimes feel like this commentariat has lost sight of what kind of privilege they have, and it can sometimes make this difficult reading as someone who comes here (every day!) for advice on how to be a better leader in this field I may not have chosen but I still have an obligation to myself and my team to succeed in. you’re not wrong! I think people with jobs that are not suited or never were WFH should butt out of this chat. I don’t know what your job is but what if I told you that because most people have to work on their feet all day that you should stand all day even if your job didn’t require it and that you should stop complaining about having to stand? Or if they suddenly made you start traveling to other cities just to do your job for no reason? Thank you. I’m also in a job that can’t be done from home and don’t understand this perspective at all. You have your skill set and we have ours. Anyone that “can’t” work from home is out of their lane commenting on the thoughts or feelings of those that can. This is a very privileged commentariat on the whole and sometimes it is a bit of a trip, yeah. So? That’s the point – people that are affected by it are talking about it. If we could only ever talk at the level of the least privileged, nothing would ever be discussed. I’m not saying not to talk about it – I’m just saying that that’s often the only lens people are bringing to the conversation and it can sometimes make discussions very myopic. Personally I prefer to work in-office (I dislike working from home; I need to have separate spaces for work and home or I feel anxious that I should be working when I’m at home), but I disagree with “if we did it before, we should be able to do it again.” Just because a thing was always done doesn’t mean it should always be done that way. I entered the workforce over 20 years ago, and the Internet was definitely not set up for people in lots of fields to work from home back then. But now it is, and if we had any doubts, the pandemic proved that quite a lot of people can work successfully from home. It’s silly to not take advantage of those tools if it makes people’s quality of life better and productivity is not being lost, just because that’s how we did it before. That is, after all, how society progresses. If we all just did things the same way because tradition, we’d still be living in caves. Why bother moving out? Caves were good enough for our ancestors, after all. To be fair, I’d take a well-lit cave over the new construction apartment I currently live in (the windows don’t open). To your actual points, though, I agree completely. WFH makes me personally anxious and I’m glad to be back in an office (at least for now), but just because it’s been the norm doesn’t mean it can’t and shouldn’t ever change. In my field, WFH has proven to be much more efficient than in office work, which makes the return-to-office push seem particularly irrational. (My field also has a high percentage of open office workplaces. I do not think those are unrelated.) I’d be fine going back to the office if I had my own or a two-person office. I would start job searching if they wanted me to return to an open office. I hope to never work in one again. It’s weird to me that people chose to move far away during the temporary WFH we had due to the pandemic and then use that as a reason they can’t come to work in the office. many workplaces didn’t make it a temp WFH The “we did without it before” argument is thin. Offices did without computers in the past too; doesn’t mean going back to typewriters is a good idea. Exactly. We lived in caves in the past too. Given the productivity *gains* my field has seen from remote work, this is particularly apt. There’s a difference between being able to do something and it being a good idea, though. Like, people used to do research and fact-checking with library card catalogues and microfiche. I acknowledge there can be benefits to being in the office, but there are also drawbacks. As someone who is not a morning person, getting to sleep in makes a real difference to my quality of life. Sure, I was able to get to the office on time when I had to, but things are much nicer now that I don’t. I also have to take issue with your characterization of people expecting they should never have to leave their homes. I imagine you’re using hyperbole here on purpose, but I don’t think that kind of thing helps us to have this conversation. I’m very much against mandating X days a week in the office for my job and similar jobs. But I will go in when there’s a good reason for it, and I have done so, even when it wasn’t technically mandatory. If you do a thing for decades, then circumstances force you to discover that actually, there is another way to do things after all, going back to “We did it before, we should be able to do it again” isn’t automatically right; what it IS, is refusing to take new data into consideration. Some jobs absolutely are better in offices (I think a lot of parts of mine are, for example; for one, the unexpected phone calls are usually some of the most time and person critical bits). But not all (my husband likes to go in several times a week but can work from home, which helps when we have sick children, or he’s feeling a bit off but can work). One would hope those who have to decide will use discernment and actual data, not tradition. We *can* go back to 5 days a week in the office. Obviously it’s possible for many people. But why, if remote work makes for a better work experience? I can wash my clothes by hand, but the washing machine makes it a better experience. Having worked in person for the majority of my 30 years working, yes, I can go back to commuting every day. I’m all for providing office space for those who prefer it. I prefer business on top, party on bottom outfits and my bedroom-to-office commute. The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again. The difference isn’t that it became physically impossible, though. The difference is that whether it could be done was tested, and based on the results different assumptions about what is possible have now taken root. People who correctly believe that they have options and want more work from home than is offered will go somewhere that offers them that. I’m kind of a hypocrite when it comes WFH – I’ve been remote sine 2016, and with about a year until I retire, I’m not going back. But I look back to the earliest days of my career and I agree with how much I benefited from learning through osmosis. I learned so, so much about how the company functions, what different departments do, where to find answers to process/procedural questions, and on and on. I really don’t think I would have been as successful in my career if I’d been working from home all along. I would have been completely lost and unaware of anything beyond my specific job. See, my previous career was very in-person and hands on – environmental chemistry. When I was working in a lab, I had to be there to run the machines. When I changed careers, I changed to one that wasn’t hands-on physical, because of my disability. If I were still doing lab work, of course I’d be going in to the lab. But now, all of the equipment I work with is in data centers around the world, and I don’t need to sit at an office desk to log in and issue commands, so I can work remotely. Why people insist that “if they do a thing, you have to do the same thing to make it ‘fair’ or some such BS” I really don’t know. Taking cars off the road by having remote capable jobs actually be remote is a good thing, IMO. For disabled folks like me, remote work means that I have spoons available for caregiving too. I just wanted to say that I’ve enjoyed reading your comments on this. I’m glad others are bringing up disability. It’s an important aspect in wfh discussions that often gets forgotten about except by those of us who it affects. It’s funny how I see this play out personally. I am a professor – I work in office, commute time of 1 hr one way, any day I have class (all 5 weekdays this semester) plus occasional weekend duties. I have family members who are: 1) hybrid, engineer, can be super flexible as long as he’s working, and regularly travels while working 2) hybrid, engineer, who works out of the office because home is terrible 3) in person, scientist, needs to do lab work, but will write from home 4) fully remote, data scientist, who quit a previous job due to bad boss + RTO mandate. Works with people all across the nation, but has a flexible schedule. In person meetings 2-3 times a year, paid for by the company 5) hybrid, tech support, who drives to an office to sit on the phone/computer without actually seeing anyone who are all also on phone/computer 6) there are more, but that’s enough Some of these make sense, some don’t, based on the type of work they’re doing. (5) could definitely work from home, but the building must be used. (4) didn’t even have an office to go back to despite the RTO push that was turning into a mess, and that was a hard deal-breaker, because they were so much more productive without chatty coworkers around. I could teach from home, but in-person classes are so much more effective with my community. There’s so much variation in workplace, work subject, and workers, that a blanket “one is better than the other” is just not possible. Although, I’d appreciate it if more people worked from home so they didn’t clog up my commute, just saying. I really do think 3 days in the office is the ideal balance in basically every situation Even if you’re only going to the office to be on the phone? Or if you teach classes 5 days a week? Or if there never was an office to begin with and the top experts are scattered across the country? I think it still varies depending on what you’re doing. Why? I mean, my immediate team is spread out over 3 cities that are each 4+ hours away from each other. There was a past letter from someone who worked remotely supporting the Wichita team, but the new mandate was that she couldn’t do that from home, but must come in and sit alone in an office in Connecticut, supporting them remotely from there. Where she didn’t actually talk to anyone, but if you checked the key fobs then her butt was in a seat in a specific building in Connecticut. My team is spread across the planet. The engineers and test teams are in Taiwan, the program manager is in Bangalore. My management is all in a city three hours from where I live. I’ve never met anyone on my team in person. Not one person. We do almost all our communication via electronic means that didn’t exist 15 years ago: Teams, Slack, occasional Zoom meeting, and good old-fashioned email (a notable exception). Even the phone calls are though our computers. I am great at my job, and working from home suits my personality and work habits really well. Even if I had an office to go to, I’d be getting up every morning, making myself presentable, and driving a car to another place where I’d sit all day doing *exactly* what I do in my home office wearing my flannel PJ’s. My company gets a lot more work out of me by keeping me a remote worker. There just isn’t much that applies to every situation these days. Our office is 400 miles away from where I live (and this was true when I was hired; I didn’t move away from commuting distance). Every member of my team lives in a different state. Yeah, right now people are supposed to be in the office three days a week due to the CEO’s decision and THEY JUST AREN’T GOING AND AREN’T EVEN GIVING A REASON WHY. I can’t fathom that these people don’t expect to lose their jobs any minute. Except most of them are giving reasons why. My advice would have been for the manager to manage, and address those people directly, and point out why this is a way to lose all WFH privileges. The employees are not a monolith, they are individuals, and she can speak to the individuals causing the problems. I think they expect to not lose their jobs because they didn’t lose their jobs any of the other times the CEO announced that. Possibly they are right. Possibly the people doing this are concentrated amongst the difficult you’d just as soon see remove themselves. Possibly the people doing this are concentrated amongst the ones who correctly believe they are too valuable to casually lose, and ignoring the rule will continue to work. It’s not like “Yeah, that’s the rule on paper, and we all just ignore it and follow the rule in practice” is a new thing for people dealing with bureaucracy. It sounds like the potential consequences haven’t been outlined; if there’s usually a progressive discipline process (warnings, PIP, etc) then people probably think that will come before being fired. It also sounds like consequences haven’t been enforced in the past, so it’s hard to tell how much this issue actually matters to management. It’s also possible that some of those people are ready to leave over the return to office requirement and prefer to be let go rather than quit. The benefits of being in the office depends heavily on the type of work you do. Additionally, while there could be some benefits to being in the office, there are also benefits to working remotely as well. If you think being in office is so crucial I am curious as to why you haven’t sought out that type of job and leave the remote positions to people who prefer it more? You are really conflating your own experience with the One Right Way. Most people want telework “out of stubbornness”? How about most people want telework to save themselves 5-10 hours of commuting every week and be better able to deal with family emergencies, just to name a couple. Try on some other people’s shoes. I’m going to have to go back in probably 5 days a week starting soon, and it’s going to cost me a couple hundred dollars a month for parking. I don’t think most people want telework out of stubbornness, but I do think many people who want telework stubbornly believe any choice a company makes outside of allowing 100% remote work is a bad choice made by incompetent people. Removing WFH for people when in-office work isn’t a clear requirement to successfully do the job is the equivalent of giving them a pay cut where none of that money goes back to the employer. If my company made me return, I’d have to pay for parking, gas, more car maintenance, and childcare after school (my kids are old enough to manage themselves after school while I work but too young to be left home alone). I’d also lose 2 hours of sleep a day and a bunch of time with family and have to rearrange my entire life. I can take 20 minutes off to pick kids up after school, but if I were in the office, I’d have to leave work for 1.5 hours to get them because of the commute. Not to mention trying to figure out how to get the kids to school on time and not be late for work. I’ve seen a lot of reasons here why forcing people to change a schedule they’ve been doing for years is unfair, but none about how it affects millions of working parents, especially working mothers. The back-to-office trend is bad for women. I hear you. I hit retirement age at the end of pandemic related work from home. It was the only 2 years on my 50+ working years I’d ever been remote. I *loved* working from home, and was able to retire without ever having to go back. But….I was a senior level consultant and when in the office, I was a resource for 60+ people informally in addition to the specific teams I serviced. All that day to day information sharing was lost. So from a corporate POV, having me WFH was a loss to their educational process. It showed me that people won’t pick up the phone or email as much as they will lean over a cube wall for a quick question. So the push me-pull you of this will be corporate needs vs the desire of staff to avoid commuting and being able to get their laundry done. Totally agree. It’s time to fire the workers and bring in people who actually want the job. In my last job we worked two days a week in office. Then my husband was tranferred 800 miles away and I worked from home for 7 years. I was very grateful that I didn’t have to find another job but there is a downside. I missed out on a lot of knowledge and social interaction. I agree with you, I enjoyed my time working from home, but like Allison said, there are benefits to working around other people — it makes collaboration and cross-training significantly easier (like Allison said, the “learning osmosis”). And I do think in-person conversation can lead to insights that Zoom/Teams ones just don’t. My team and I each work 1 day/week from home, which I think is fine 2-3 days/week in office and at home seems perfect actually. The research agrees that for most people and most jobs 2-4 days in the office results in the most happiness and productivity BUT that’s a broad stroke. The optimum balance for individuals and businesses is going to vary widely depending on age, job, position, etc. Of course he will win. He is the CEO. We have a similar discussion at the moment and had I known the strict rules for office days they want to implement now, I would not have chosen this employer two years ago. And I am definitely in favour of working in the office. But I am under no illusion that the CEO cares about that. Of course he will win. He is the CEO. Well, TBD. We had six (that I know of) businesses fold in my hometown of ~35M (35,000) people over the past 4 years, explicitly citing “not able to get enough good/dependable/reliable/productive workers onsite.” If enough people vote with their feet, the CEO could well end up with no one to give orders to (or less than the quorum needed to conduct business). How is this a win for anyone exactly? Your town had 6 businesses close which means what, they moved elsewhere or shut down entirely? That is not great for the town revenue nor is it good in the long haul. Finding a happy medium would be good for everyone. One of the little secrets of remote work is that the business doesn’t have to be in the town for the town to thrive. Corporate taxes aren’t generally municipal, and if the *workers* are still in town, they’re still frequenting local businesses and paying taxes, probably more than if they had to drive to the next town over. Less driving means less damage to roads and less congestion. If businesses are shutting down because all the local workers are both happy to and able to work remote, it’s not a problem for the town at all. My point is that the businesses themselves have to pay taxes and those revenues are much higher than what residents pay. Things that benefit everyone. This is why cities and towns want to bring in a business. I just claimed the CEO may be playing a losing move, and cited recent experience of examples where it (may have) played out that way. Just because the CEO loses doesn’t mean someone else necessarily wins. One of the businesses was a bakery, but the other 5 were white collar/knowledge work. Nobody said this is a win for anyone. Just that it wasn’t a win for the CEO. It’s wild to me that these leaders decided to keep pushing forward with requiring people to be on-site and shut down (or move) than just be more flexible on that requirement. Seems like more evidence that this strong preference some leaders have isn’t based on data or logic. This happened at my partners company. They mandated 3 days/week gave people 6 month notice and then made it 4 days about 6 months later. Why? People were not following 3 days and their managers didnt do anything about it. IT went into the system and used the data and showed people weren’t working/being productive at home and not working when they said they were. To OP, they can see a lot more than your card swipes! I always eye roll when people say this. If your system or laptop is owned by your company they can access that. They can tell if you use a mouse mover, etc. Also more and more companies are checking to see if you’re unavailable certain times of the day. Kid emergencies, occasionally, fine, but if you pick your kid up and send a couple emails from 3-5 and call it a day that isn’t okay to do. If your employees aren’t listening to the mandates then how do you even know if they are doing their work? I had one team member tell me they worked 8 hours and did X work. Well, they didn’t work 8 hours, but what they got done in that time period pre-covid someone got done in 1-2 hours max. More and more companies are RTO and those who let people work remote are monitoring their employees more. Honestly, I work with clients and the ones who are remote are usually the harder ones to get in contact/get a response from. I don’t want to generalize, but that is usually the issue. “how do you even know if they are doing their work?” I dunno. Are they meeting their goals or not? That is, how do you know if someone is doing her work when she is in the office? Yup. So many of these discussions come down to management having no clue how to measure productivity, and using face time as a proxy. THIS. Exactly. Too many managers (and CEOs) are lazy and incapable of managing by results, so they just manage by presence. Their employees, and ultimately their companies, pay the price. I am perfectly capable of being a flake in the office if I’m mentally checked out. I also used to have a coworker who would come and yak at several of us, screwing up our ability to get anything done Exactly. When I worked full-time in office you could still browse the internet, stare at your desk, go for long walks, chat with coworkers and other things that weren’t productive. You don’t always have a babysitter in the office who keeps a watch over everyone. Usually managers have actual work to do and can’t observe everyone all day. I got really good at listening to podcasts while pretending to read documents. This is why I’m way more productive at home. I do like the interaction in our office, but it’s really easy to get bogged down in conversations with coworkers on a daily basis. I probably lose at least an hour every time I’m in the office because we’re a chatty bunch. If I have a heavy workload and/or tight deadlines (which happens more often than not), buckling down at home without any distractions is the only way I’m making progress. I think if you had IT look at everyone’s computer usage when they are in the office too, that they’ll also see a lot of gaps, too much internet time, etc. If they didn’t look at that before, I don’t know that looking at the home use is a good comparison. Also, we all have productivity dips and spikes, and there are sometimes slower periods where your job is mainly to be “available”. You’re still plenty available if you take 10 minutes here and there to check the laundry. Personally, I think my productivity is similar either way. I waste more time “people-ing” in the office vs. fitting in some chores at home. I probably have more energy at home, because I get an extra half hour of sleep because no commute, and because it’s easier to walk out the door for a 2 minute sunshine break when I need a pick-me-up vs. taking the elevator down multiple floors at the office. Also, my bathroom is closer at home, lol. And at home, I’m more willing to ride a high productivity spike as far as it goes, even if that takes me past bedtime. I’m not always comfortable staying at an office that late. A lot of companies can really make remote or hybrid work, but every company is subject to the desires of leadership, so that kind of is what it is. If OP wants to retain any WFH flexibility at all for their team, they are going to HAVE to enforce in office days. I’m physically at work and just had to escape my coworker who likes to drop by and talk at me for as long as possible. He complains that management wants him to come to work when he’s perfectly fine working at home, yet doesn’t seem to clue in that we can all notice that he isn’t doing work when he’s here (I also have the impression he’s on a PIP, so he’s really clueless). I’m at the office today and the hourly trainers are just chatting. Us salaried workers are heads down. This is why my boss’s go to responses when someone comes to IT to find out productivity is to tell them to be a manager and set goals. Way too often we have managers ask for teams status logs, which we don’t have because in our organization that would be way too much data. Sometimes we have managers ask for something to prove their employees aren’t working but already have more than enough evidence. Like Susan, your employee has multiple complaints of being unresponsive, the work output is nonexistent, you told us the employee sounds asleep when you call him. Be a freaking manager and go to HR to start the term process instead of being mad we don’t have a webcam tracker system. Many people’s work is NOT just sit at computer move mouse – even on days when I don’t have classes, I have calls (no mouse movement usually), conversations with other people, walking to the printer, doing stuff on paper (I plan and sometimes edit on paper), walking to other parts of the campus, in the library, in a meeting room… at least half of an in office day is NOT on a computer at all, and a good chunk of wfh days are still not moving mouse clicking keyboard type work. Thinking for a start does not always involve clicking anything (unless I am playing solitaire whilst thinking…) My job is literally ‘open email, write down email subject, make sure email has been filed, move email to ‘done’ folder, rinse and repeat’ and I still have to interact with people. Staring at the computer screen trying to figure out how to solve the problem it is displaying, without moving the mouse. In this case, too, the LW IS the manager, who could do the managing to make sure they don’t get a stricter mandate — by calling out the people who aren’t working or aren’t giving any reason for not showing up. By checking in, and collecting productivity data herself. If she can prove Joaquin and Anya are successful wherever they work, and Chris’s productivity numbers are actually lower In Office, but Wakeen’s numbers are noticeably lower at home, and Izzy rarely comes to the office and is impossible to reach after 3 PM, she can address the real problem. If your employees aren’t listening to the mandates then how do you even know if they are doing their work? I’ve freelanced remotely since the 90s, and it is just wild to me that some earnestly believe that there is no way a boss could tell whether or not I was doing the work project they had contracted with me for other than by checking how often my mouse moved. I have to show progress and give updates! I think the point was that this LW does not seem to be managing well, whether in-office or not. They’ve thrown up their hands about RTO, is it likely they have established goals and metrics to measure production? Maybe, but it’s worth asking. LW here! Yeah my concerns are nothing about, “Is our staff being productive?” They’re all doing exactly what they need to be doing! It’s literally just about appearing in the office because we’re concerned 3 days turning into 5 days. I also forgot to mention half the team is local, half the team is remote (in large part because either people were hired during COVID or people moved during COVID to other states). So there’s that pickle too. I feel that “lose talented experienced workers” is a wonderful fantasy, but won’t happen. My company is 3 days in office (not respected by all people), and will probably be 5 days in-office by the end of the year. I’d be surprised if as many as 10% of people left. We’re a niche industry (certain type of engineering), and …. there just aren’t that many places to pivot to. I also agree with L-squared that 2-3 days in office is good for actually meeting people in person, and as Alison pointed out, for training junior people, or people new to the company. Slack/teams doesn’t fill the same role. When the CEO at my last job changed the definition of hybrid from “2-3 days a week, based on the needs of your department” to “Mon-Thu, no exceptions; if you have to be home for even a few hours during those days (to let a repair person in, for instance), then you have to use PTO because we also aren’t doing flextime anymore,” my department of 15 people lost 5 of those people. I was one of the five. In the 1.5 years since, another 3 of the original 15 left. Yes, the department has been able to replace them with people who are fine with 4 rigid days in the office, but the 8 they lost were the senior-most people with the most knowledge. So they lost half of an entire department because of the RTO mandate, which cost the company money to recruit, money to pay the new people (always at least a little bit higher than the ones who left), and productivity lost while the new people gain the knowledge and skills that the ones who left had (which takes years). And that was just *my* department. The same thing unfolded companywide. If they replaced senior people with junior people, they did not pay higher. That may have been the plan. My last employer had over a decade of ‘WF Anywhere’. I started WFH in 2007 (my ‘team’ was in Europe and Mexico, I am in the US, so where I worked didn’t matter), and the ‘back to the office’ edict came in 2017. Everyone had 12 months to arrange to work at a local hub, and they were closing smaller locations. So, for example, people who had been working in Charlotte NC had to go to RTP (2hrs away) to work at least 3 days / week. People who’d moved to FL or coastal regions preparing for retirement were expected to be back in one of the central offices. This impacted older employees much more than younger ones. The company planned it to gain cover for firing older workers. The class action lawsuits are still playing out, but it’s now mostly about whether separation agreements can really be used to stop people from suing when companies break the law, not about whether the company broke the law. I saw the company use this and other tools to force early retirements. Why pay a supply chain team lead $150K when you could hire a new one for $110K? Programmers / engineers / sales were a little cushioned from this by demand and relationships, but for back office functions, new people were much less expensive. (yes, the company is probably obvious to people who pay attention, but I may be legally required to not mention the name. I got laid off 10 months ago due to closing down manufacturing, but I’m in a position that I like better and they were at least reasonably generous, so no hard feelings on my behalf. On behalf of that $150K team lead tho – he was the best manager I *ever* had, in 30 years working for multiple companies, and the replacement… was not. Salty about that one.) This was my biggest fear in applying for jobs posted as “hybrid.” Other than the fact that some were not actually hybrid at all, I had heard tell of many companies offering a position as hybrid and then pulling the rug out from the employees and mandating RTO. At the very least, if this had happened to me, I’d be looking. If it were a discipline/work productivity issue where someone said, “Okay, we can see you aren’t actually doing anything at home and are disappearing all day, so we need you to RTO” that’s one thing. If the CEO developed a butts in seats attitude suddenly and switched gears for no real reason rooted in logic, I’d be less than pleased, particularly if it were in certain areas. There are certain jobs I wouldn’t mind commuting to for 2-3 days a week, but not a full 5. My friend’s company recently announced RTO. They had a 300% increase in resignations within the first month (before the RTO even took effect). HAHA. I’ve been working from home for more than a decade. I’m a pretty valuable employee and highly compensated for it. ilIf there was ever a return to office mandate I’d be out within a week working for our competitors. Studies Joe that it returned to office mandate typically results in 15 to 20% turnover but that turnover is skewed highly towards the best performers leaving the company. Random data point: was on the JP Morgan Chase earnings call today. When someone asked about efficiency/cost cutting, they mentioned having clearly overhired during covid and needing to seek “efficiency” there. They also made waves about RTO. People are framing the JPM RTO as a nefarious control tactic and lazy way to do a layoff. In reality, it’s more a case where the “spreadsheet” and “backoffice” work that is easy to do from anywhere is getting streamlined and automated, and the company now needs/prioritizes (mid level and senior) people who can solve their more urgent problems, such as how to deploy all of their capital. Those things usually require meetings/brainstorming sessions I’ve been working from home since 2020 with 1 day onsite since 2023, and I’ve had meetings and brainstorming sessions this whole time. You assume that “talented, experienced workers” want to work from home and would oppose more office work. This is certainly untrue in many cases. I am not opposed to 1-2 days of work from home per week, but the idea that you’re going to permanently atomize your workforce and never interact with another human is an AAM fetish, bit reality. *not reality Working from home and “never interacting with another human” are two completely different things. I WFH and interact with my coworkers all day long. Interacting via Teams rather than in-person has no effect on the work I do, other than I get much more done because I don’t have to commute and I’m not interrupted constantly by idle chatter. As the father of two teens, my observation is that they are perfectly happy with their social lives being largely, or even entirely, virtual. It’s not for me, but I’m an old. They are — and data is increasingly showing that this is a big concern, socially and educationally! You might want to read up on that. I haven’t dug too far into this, but it looks like the data is a lot more nuanced than just “online-only interaction bad for teens”. The *type* of interaction seems to matter a great deal. Scrolling through social media seems to be particularly problematic; texting or video chatting with friends, commenting in online communities and similar tend to be much better for teens. Since my stroke in 1995, a large part of my social interaction has been virtual, often by text only, without cameras or voice. The concept that you can’t have a social life without being physically colocated does not match with my reality at all. Same. Not stroke but injury that caused disability. I’ve had online friendships that are still going strong 15 years later. I’ve preferred to deal with people virtually (good old email!) for nearly all aspects of work whenever it is possible, because I can listen and understand better, am less distracted, and just more comfortable and feel more competent all round. Found out last year, aged 55, that I’m AuDHD which probably explains a lot of it, but I’m also an introvert. Nuance is really important – people have different needs, and both companies and roles have different needs, expectations and mores around whether it is acceptable, expected or a problem to chat, have music on, drop in on people, take long coffee breaks which have a little work in them and call them a meeting, expect people to spend substantial chunks of time travelling around buildings or a campus for different meetings regardless of their role etc. It is absolutely true that WFH is not the same as being in the same physical environment. We operate differently online vs in person, and we learn about each other and our work differently. It is infuriating when the AAM commentariat pretend that they’re equivalent — it does this topic a huge disservice! Why can’t we be truthful about the differences without espousing a judgment about which one is better? I am fully remote (my entire org is), but we have a healthy budget for team retreats and an org-wide retreat. I could not be successful working from home if I didn’t have that 5x/year in-person time. You might deny that, but I would genuinely have trouble believing you. I’ve been in my current, 100% remote role for two years. I have never met any of my coworkers in person. I haven’t had a problem getting to know people. I would call meeting 5 times a year fully remote. I have worked fully remote for 5 years. In that time, I have met some of my coworkers in person and others I haven’t. I have the closest working relationships with the coworkers who I work with frequently, engage in some non-work conversation with, and I either see often in person *or* turn on their cameras. Honestly, the only major difference for me between a video conversation and an in-person conversation is finding out how tall the other person is. My coworkers are in other cities being forced to go to offices there while I’m forced to go to the one in my city. I have never met any of them in person and likely never will. Studies are showing that RTO mandates are driving higher turnover, usually of better performing employees (and no, I’m not monkey, I’ve just seen the same studies). It’s not universal, but the true best way is to be as flexible as you can within the needs of the business. A lot of commenters make it clear that they are in contact with their coworkers whether in person or remote, through Zoom/Teams. Might your job be creating a specific bias in your head about what remote work looks like? I am of the same opinion as you — I would not like a job where it was 100% WFH, however, if I had applied for a job that offered 1-2 days a week of WFH and suddenly that was rescinded, I’d be pretty peeved and probably looking for a new job. Hm seems like your kids need to enforce some work boundaries I doubt he’ll lose talent. The job market is terrible and especially for remote roles. I applied to an internal job and was rejected without interview a month later. Since it was internal they gave me feedback when I asked. The feedback was “You are great and I would have hired you if I had seen your resume… but we got over 2,000 applications on the first day. HR sent me a hundred qualified applicants by the end of day 2 and I only looked at about 30 resumes before having a good slate to hire from. I made an offer to one of those candidates.” I had applied on day 3 and was never even seen by HR or the HM. It’s just that competitive for remote right now. “FWIW: both my kids are WFH. They put in way more than 8 hours a day since the computer is right there and they keep working.” This is not the selling point you think it is, at least not from the worker’s point of view. There is something to be said for being able to get up from your desk, leave, and not think about work until tomorrow. If your kids are working extra hours because hey, the computer’s right there and they don’t have anything else to do, that means they need to learn how to unplug and get a life, not that they’re model WFH employees. Most successful long term WFH people have said they are so because they have some kind of barrier between work and leisure spots in the house; usually an office, but in one case it’s literally a different computer on the opposite side of his home office desk; “Get up, walk around the table, have different wall decor in view” is still enough to do a mental reset. That’s what’s going on in all the industries everywhere: everyone is being mandated back to office full time. I think we’re all stuck. Exactly. This was me during covid. I’d roll out of bed at 6:30 or 7, check my e-mail and then just never leave my chair until a short lunch break or dinner, after which I would often be back in my chair. My grandboss had the nerve to complain that we were all just on a long “vacation” and it was time to get back to work (in person). As we met incredible schedules and did amazing work. Later I found out that he was projecting. *He* was taking time off at home to do (important) things. And he figured we were all doing that. Hmm, that could explain a lot of of the unnecessary RTO pressure, now that you mention it. The situation in the letter sounds like terrible management all around. A mandate without any reasoning behind it besides “I want it so/other companies are doing it” won’t be well received, and ignoring said mandate by changing it and then letting people be wishy/washy about it is asking for trouble given that you know that it’s something that the CEO actually cares about, whatever the reason. I agree with Alison: get clear guidance from up top, be very clear in communicating the expectations and consequences of not following them, and let the chips fall where they may. Some thoughts (that pertain to jobs that can actually be remote): Management is a set of skills on its own; the skills for managing a fully in office team are different from those for a local hybrid team are different for those for a fully remote team that’s potentially spread across states and/or timezones. A lot of orgs/departments/managers don’t bother to put the time in to figure out what makes sense for their particular business needs and are trying to apply a one-size-fits-all strategy. I was on a team that stayed fully remote after things opened up, both because of the nature of the work and the personalities of the people. The more casual and/or social interactions were done via non work-related chats about various topics and (actually) optional virtual events that weren’t so often as to a be nuisance, were organized by different people so it didn’t become part of one person’s job, and were scheduled during the work day before closing so as not to interfere with personal time. Several people have mentioned loneliness/boundaries between work and home and while I don’t feel the same, I get it. My issue is if your office is already hybrid, what’s stopping you from going in all you want? Presumably everyone who feels the same would also be going in regularly/frequently so a mandate wouldn’t be needed. If you are going in and finding you’re the only one there (i.e., it doesn’t solve the loneliness problem), that might indicate that the company’s culture isn’t a good fit and it’s worth considering whether moving on wouldn’t be better. That element of socialization used to be a given for office work, so people like me for whom it is very draining would to have to factor that in and keep it pushing. The difference now is that those who really thrive with it can’t take for granted that it will be a part of their work day. Lastly – one thing I didn’t see mentioned before I started typing is that some orgs are doing RTO mandates with the express purpose of pushing people out and avoid layoffs. They know how many people have moved or are still local but rely on the time saved from commuting/the flexibility to get chores done or run an errand during a break, and are betting that enough of them aren’t willing to give that up and will quit. I don’t think that’s the case in OP’s company (it doesn’t seem like that CEO has thought it through that thoroughly, tbh) but since a lot of comments are addressing the RTO vs. hybrid vs. WFH question more generally, I thought it pertinent. I’m the LW! I can definitely take the feedback that in terms of this RTO mandate, my boss and I haven’t been the best. Our original thinking was that we wanted to be flexible and understanding because other than myself and one other person, the others’ commutes are like 1 to 1.5 hours. Plus, so many other departments were also in a huff over it that we felt we were following the mandate the closest and got by a year without complaints for the 2 days! So it’s just a bummer to be here now. I will say while the RTO thing is something to address head on per Allison’s guidance, we’ve been able to set a pretty good structure for our hybrid team. Because half the team is remote permanently as they live in different states and timezones. So during COVID, which is when things started shifting, we adjusted over time and do pretty well. Always places to learn, but better than we were before for sure (not just for work but for culture as well). So yes to your notes on that being considerations people need to take for hybrid and/or remote situations. The team is great. The real issue is just the appearing IRL. (I don’t know but my original comment didn’t post so this may show up twice?) I think there’s at least a 50% chance that the CEO doesn’t have the stones to fire anyone and things stay as they are. An update would be brilliant. “You will lose talented experienced workers and see a decline in productivity…” Do you have a source for that? this post reminded me of another letter where an employee was coming in to work, clocking in, then clocking out again and going home. Did we ever get an update to that? That was common enough that there was a whole term for it, although it escapes me at the moment! And I think OP is saying-not-saying that it’s an okay solution as far as she’s concerned! Coffee badging? Aside from coffee badging being wrong in principle, it would seem that when you head home after badging in, your employer is paying you for travel time. I guess presumably you could add that time back onto the end of the day, which is what I do when I run errands at lunch or something. But in the letter we had here about it, I admit it was Not A Great Look haha. I suppose if the whole reason for RTO is the passionate love of spontaneous hallway conversations, leadership really might be satisfied with mornings / a couple hours a day of that (but in the letter I got the impression the guy turned 180 degrees after badging in and left, so probably not even *one* spontaneous hallway convo in that time period … At my husband’s office, someone didn’t even coffee badge. They reportedly were caught on camera pulling up, swiping and returning to their car. And thus significant rumors started that IT would track internet pings and if you were under 4hrs, you’d have issues/it wouldn’t count to the 60% monthly in office requirement (which is already an obnoxious calculation because you inevitably need to be more in more than 3 days a week given partial weeks at the end/beg of each month.) The letter Meemur is referring to is “I’m in trouble for badging in, then going back home” (first letter on the short answer post from November 14, 2023). As of right now, there’s no update for that letter. That LW didn’t seem to think there was any problem with what they were doing, so good odds it didn’t end great for them That’s the one, thank you. I couldn’t remember the term at all I’m not 100% sure, but it sounds like that LW worked for the same place I do (it’s the exact same set-up and the mandate she was describing sounded word-for-word like my company’s). If I’m right, then LW’s only options were to get fired, quit, or suck it up and go to the office, unfortunately. Managers receive a regular report on their employees’ badge-in and badge-out times, and they do get dinged for chronically absent staff. Layoffs, terrible clients, working ’til 11pm.. This job doesn’t sound so great even if it was completely remote! Maybe this new mandate is the kick you need to look elsewhere? Yeah OP I hope you’re looking yourself so you can “be the change” – “we told you workers didn’t want to come back to the office, you insisted which is your right, now 25% of our workforce is giving notice, oh and I am also, my last day is in two weeks.” This is very satisfying! A question for Sloanicota. If you’re so convinced that 25% of your workforce will resign if asked to work in an office, what is to stop a company from laying off that 25% and replacing them with cheaper employees in India or another emerging market? After all, “work can be done anywhere” and you’re “just as productive” with permanent remote work, so why not go whole hog and get people who can work remotely from India? Well if the company wants to get people back into the office, hiring people thousands of miles away doesn’t seem to achieve that goal Well, you’d have to figure out the laws and schedules and payroll for an entire other country, or pay someone to handle it for you, which would eat away at the discount you receive from buying cheap outsourced labor. You also have to either pay them to work overnight or accept that you won’t have your employees available during standard business hours. 1. The transaction cost of handling payroll processing in India is trivial compared to what can be saved in salaries. If it weren’t, outsourcing would not be a thing. 2. The “follow the sun” model is a thing, and many businesses find it a feature, rather than a bug. 3. Even if you find time zones a showstopper, then substitute “Argentina” for “India.” Not quite as cheap, but still cheaper than the US. My company is one of these – we have workers literally around the globe. Teams working together regularly span 8, 12, or even 16 hours worth of time zones. If you’re not used to it, it sounds impossible but it does work in the end. A lot of people work unusual hours (being on the US West Coast I work start work at 7am but then I have a ton of flexibility later in the day when everyone else is offline. On the other hand a lot of people in India work more like noon-8pm local time). But our workload is such that you don’t need to be working long hours, just weird ones sometimes. Biggest downside is that with very little working-hours overlap most questions and requests don’t get answered until the next day. Which slows things down but people accept that. I do assume at some point my job could be outsourced (they’re already no longer hiring in my region, new hires for my role are all in Spain now), but I’ll deal with that if it happens (thus far they’re just moving things via attrition, not layoffs). For a start, time zones. Even if work can be done anywhere, you have to be awake to be answering emails and logging into remote meetings. As someone currently doing a bunch of work with people in Europe, this is a huge deal. For a second, language barrier. For a third, it’s not necessarily the case that work that can be generally done remote doesn’t still need people in the office 1-2 days a month, for major meetings with clients, picking up and dropping off equipment, etc. For a fourth, there’s tax implications that most businesses are not able to meet to using a foreign workforce while claiming to be a domestic company. “For a second, language barrier.“ Shockingly, English is widely spoken at a native level in India. Setting that aside, I have invested in tech companies that hire programmers in Ukraine and other countries. For mechanical work like programming it works just fine. Grammar Ly is a great example of a company that does software development in Ukraine, and yet English proficiency is its core mission. The case for keeping employees in the US rests on collaboration and willingness to interact in person. If you’re insisting on full time work from home, someone in India or another offshore market can do y the same thing much more cheaply. Be careful what you wish for. In my experience, Indian English is generally VERY different from American or British English. Language barrier doesn’t always mean “we speak different languages,” it can also mean, “we technically speak the same language but our grammar and cultural norms are so different that it is hard to communicate.” And yet there are plenty of companies across the US that don’t outsource as a punishment for workers who would prefer to WFH. Instead, these businesses provide their domestic employees with flexible remote or hybrid work options because it makes good business sense for them to do so. And for what it’s worth, there are scores of us who can successfully WFH while still successfully collaborating and interacting with colleagues. Plus companies that can, by the nature of their work, be “Remote Only” and don’t need much of an office footprint save a bunch of money. IIRC, the two biggest expenses for a company are salaries and real estate related costs. I mean, by that logic nobody should ever advocate for better working conditions. LOL. Inglish is not Anglish (Indian English is not the same as American English.) I’ve worked for companies with a “follow the sun” model for operations. Handoffs are still a PITA. This is unnecessarily combative Short answer: It’s going to be automation, the grand wave of US outsourcing is pretty much over. Long answer: As someone who has done the work assessing where to put new offices for a global manufacturing company, while you *could* get people to work from anywhere, there’s a lot of factors to consider when looking at where to hire: 1. The emerging market must have a certain level of technically literate people, so that you have a decent applicant pool. Many of those markets have been exploited to the point that the salary levels + mgmt costs have risen significantly over the last 20 years. We considered MX, CN, IN, Brazil, and Hungary, as we already had operations in those countries. Only China still had slack in the labor market; BR, HU, and MX salaries + mgmt costs were on par with US, and we still had a lot of turnover for higher paying jobs. I forget whether IN was on par, but the turnover was high there too, much higher than in the US for the same functions (accounting / audit / order placing / cust service). 2. Political issues and stability matter. European countries have fewer political concerns, but no salary savings there. 3. The importance of office / tech costs surprised me. We ended up not going w Hungary because there was no space in the Hungary office for more people, and a new office space was VERY expensive. People could not wfh in most of the emerging markets, the electricity and connectivity just weren’t there. HU / MX people often had to come in to the office to load the work they’d done. We looked at some other costs that I forget, but those three were the critical factors. In 2014, my employer put the team in an existing Chinese office, but the employer closed down that team in 2022 as part of reducing their Chinese footprint. I think they just did away with the function, but I know they brought a couple other functions back from CN / EU to the US, where they’d suddenly regained a lot of office space due to WFH and owning the buildings. Right now, CN would probably welcome the jobs back, but with Russia / Ukraine and CN / Taiwan, plus tariffs…. it’s a hard sell for outsourcers. This is super interesting! Just replying to signal boost it. I bet this would be great as a stand alone post, maybe in an interview format. Agree! I would love for Alison to interview this person if both are willing! … But the company wouldn’t take this awesome cost saving measure anyhow, laying off the more expensive stateside people? Having worked with teams from India, for some reason that doesn’t work very well. There are cultural and time zone communication issues, for one. The management style and resulting work ethics and habits are different. You end up spendsing a lot of time making sure everyone is on the same page, and even then, it sometimes goes very much sideways. Honestly, jobs that can be successfully outsourced will be regardless. Jobs that can be successfully automated will be. It’s been happening for decades now. It seems unlikely that resistance to RTO mandates without any reasoning behind them will be the thing that causes a whole bunch of previously domestic jobs to be outsourced, if the COVID-times demonstration of how many jobs could be done remotely didn’t. So your argument is we should never advocate for better working conditions in case our employers fire us anyway and outsource? That’s what stood out to me not what the CEO says goes. OP I think part of the reason you are so stressed about this mandate is you are really burned out on this job. You work late then still have to show up the next morning because your CEO has a butts in seats mentality. On top of which you have to act like you are happy. Not only are you going to lose good people over this, since as you say you are isolated in online meetings anyway so why are people in the office? But they are going to lose you, either a breakdown or you leave for saner pastures. I would opt for looking for a job while you still have the energy to do it. That stood out to me too! LW, you sound exhausted. Are there better options out there for you? Even if you’re personally okay with the RTO, it sounds like it wouldn’t hurt to look around. I know that’s hard when you have so little free time, but it can absolutely be worth it. FWIW, it feels like there’s another big wave of RTO mandates coming down, just from my anecdotal experience. Most of my friends who work for companies with new RTO orders are looking for other work. If they were hired for remote jobs, it now feels like part of their compensation package to not have to commute, buy new office clothes, wear makeup every day, and be constantly watched. Getting that taken away without any additional perks to make up for it (and often with a fair amount of condescension and implications that they’re not doing their jobs) is enough to drive good employees away. Haha, I really wasn’t expecting comments to point this out to me, but I guess on re-read of my letter it makes sense why. LW here. Thank you for your concern, and you’re all right, I am quite exhausted. I won’t mention the hours I worked this week answering a proposal from an international client who gave us barely 5 business days to respond when we normally need 3 weeks for a project of that size. I’ve been at this company going on 7.5 years now. My friends and ex-coworkers have all asked me the same thing: look elsewhere! There’s a million excuses I gave before. I will say despite this lame job, one thing I do have here is that I do have a lot of flexibility thanks to my boss. He runs our department in its own little pocket (hence part of the reason for this RTO mandate situation) and it’s saved me from a lot of the political garbage that goes on around here. But the higher I’ve gone, the more I see it, and it’s adding to my stress + on top of the regular work. The terrible clients are paying us less. I do want to escape. But my industry the last 2-3 years has been hit HARD. The avg before of people being out of work was 3 – 6 months. Lately it’s been 1 – 1.5 years. That’s so scary to me. But I applied for graduate school to change careers so crossing my fingers! Though given my working hours the past year and a half, I don’t think my goal of doing both at the same time is going to be feasible. I will probably vaporize into nothing! That’s what happened to me! I started a remote job during Covid and eventually it was time to return to in-office work. I realized that I didn’t want to see these jerks in person, the only way I tolerated the job was because I didn’t have to sit next to them all day. The job itself was pretty crappy and the return to office notice was my kick to look for a new job. Not to mention “nonstop meetings”–ugh! Working til 11 is really egregious Someone seriously needs to speak up and tell the CEO what the truth is. That forcing people into an office is antiquated and not necessary. We are in the 21st century now and we have proven for the last 5 years we can work from home and be MORE productive. It’s also cheaper. It also allows disabled people to work. It allows people who are chronically ill to work, because commuting is the hardest part of any job. If everyone either quit or refused to work until he sees the light of day maybe that will convince him. Also, you don’t have to remain as in the middle as you have been. If this is a settled situation in your CEO’s mind, don’t feel obligated to allow your team to rehash the reasons they’re against it over and over. It’s completely fine to start saying “the CEO has made his decision” and decline to provide a sounding board for an additional round of argument. Agreed. I’ve had managers who did that, and I actually respected them. They basically said “this isnt my call. I can’t change it, this is what has come down from above. If you choose not to do this, then we can figure out the best way to move forward.” I think it’s the clarity and consistency that is key. I disagree with the take that “CEO’s word stands,” but you need to be strategic on what battles you pick and how you pick those battles (in other words, politics). And you need to be willing to accept the consequences of your path. I’ve had some kooky CEOs who did some kooky policies (looking at you, tech start-up). Sometimes I flat out told them that I would not enforce those policies because they were illegal/violated our client agreement/unethical and would have us laughed out the door by any decent client. Sometimes I nodded and said I would need to “evaluate the application of that policy”, then changed absolutely nothing and waited for the CEO to get distracted by the next shiny idea (some well placed bureaucracy can work wonders). Sometimes I would enforce part or all of it, especially if it was something that didn’t really impact my team at all (if it barely impacts you, no reason not to apply it). No matter what I chose to do, I was always very clear with my team about what I expected of them, and that if anyone got in trouble, it would be me. And if I said we would do X, then I enforced that (usually just through gentle reminders, but sometimes through a serious sit-down and “hey, this is part of your job and you need to do it”). Yeah. You’re just the messenger here. Not your decision, and not your responsibility to try to argue it. You can make it clear you think it’s not a good situation, if that’s what you think, and still make it clear that it’s not one you can change. I agree that clarity and then drawing a line under the discussion will help. From the employee side — I feel uncomfortable when middle managers come across as asking for reassurance that I’m not upset about the changes. My responsibility is to be pleasant and professional, and to take or leave the working conditions that leaders have decided we’re going to have. So I’m looking, and in the meantime, I’m doing my job well, showing up when you want me to (whether it makes sense to me or not), and being pleasant and professional. But I wish my grandboss would stop pressing, “I know you prefer more flexibility, how are you REALLY feeling about policy X?” Short answer: I wish I could upvote! Long answer: There are many things I am unhappy about at my job. Yes, I am evaluating and planning my future. Meanwhile, do not ask me to perform the emotional labor of assuring anyone about how I am REALLY feeling about policy X. I feel like I should do my job. Please and thank you. Yep. If people end up leaving over that, then they leave, and you communicate to the higher-ups what you can feasibly accomplish while you’re searching for and training their replacements. If the higher-ups don’t care what’s feasible, or you get tired of having to replace people over this, then you start thinking about your next move, too. The problem is, you have to make a lot of in-the-moment judgment calls about what to do about people not complying. How many days a month can someone work from home for a seemingly reasonable reason (sick kid, plumber coming, etc.) before you have to speak to them? How quickly do you escalate the discipline? Does the CEO really want you to fire people over this? Just if they come in less than once a week? less than three times a week? Over what period? What if they’re a high performer with a hard-to-find skill set? What if it’s because their kid is going through a medical issue? When the rubber meets the road, OP has to decide what to do, and it sounds like their leadership isn’t giving them the guidance they need to implement this new policy. Way before 2020 I had a battle with my boss and bosses boss about my employees working from home. I lost. While it still irks me I knew it wasn’t something I was going to win if I pushed more than I already had so I made my employees come in when needed and defended them rightly when it made sense (I got a full WFH accommodation for one employee). I suspect that there’s an aspect of “… or else what?” And the answer isn’t “Or else everyone not doing 5 days in office will be immediately fired, and we’ll just hire someone else to do your job.” It’s more “As the mid-level manager, you should be able to cajole cheerful workers back into the office full-time with the power of your personality.” If anything, I think OP would be doing both themselves and their team a big favour by taking a firmer stance on this. At present, it sounds like the team has no good reason to believe that the rules they’re being asked to follow actually mean anything. They’ve been given directives from the CEO, but then middle management bends the rules and basically render those directives meaningless. But they’re not meaningless: the CEO clearly does care about this issue and is getting increasingly unhappy, to the point that HR is pulling key records, and may well implement an even stricter policy. It feels a bit like the middle management has been trying to be Cool Boss and creating further confusion. Unfortunately, the time to speak up was when the CEO first said people should be in three days a week. Instead all the teams basically just ignored him to do their own thing which is going to make bargaining with him now a lot more difficult. LW, when you guys decided to try two days in the office instead of three did you even tell your CEO you were doing that? Or did you just sneak around him? Ultimately WFH works on a trust-based system that employees are actually doing work while at home, and not spending time doing other things. LW would have had a lot more leverage if everyone had come back into the office 3 days a week and productivity dropped. Instead, they did not enforce the CEO’s direct order. Now trust has been lowered and the opportunity to clearly show the decline is gone. I get that the order might be for something unnecessary and possibly with bad effects on productivity. I do. But unless it’s something actively illegal or seriously unethical, disobeying a direct order is a really bad way to start a negotiation over something a CEO doesn’t want to do in the first place. I would argue that WFH doesn’t really rely on trust. Most jobs involve tasks that can be checked. Are emails and phone calls getting answered in a timely matter? Are projects getting done? Are clients and co-workers getting what they need? If so, then clearly the person is actually doing work while at home. LW here! For the first part of your message: That’s not true, when the CEO first gave the mandate, even higher senior people than I did tell the CEO it wasn’t a good idea. There were weeks of ongoing discussions that my boos would fill me in on. And from there is the waterfall affect of different departments doing their own. For your second question: I don’t speak to the CEO! Thankfully, he’s terrible. My boss who regularly does didn’t outright say this is what we’re doing to put a spotlight on us. He used his magic to tell him yes we’re in office the majority of the mandate (my boss is a very skilled people person. Whereas my feelings are easily read on my face, hence the no CEO interaction by design of mine). (Hoping this comment goes through but it might not!) My organization has been navigating layoffs over the last two years. We haven’t been able to give ample raises or bonuses, and our staff is exhausted. Instead of asking them to start commuting again, we let them stay home. Return to office is like getting a pay cut – do you really want to give your employees a pay cut when they’re working harder than ever with fewer colleagues? I think the CEO needs a reality check. Yes! It is like getting a paycut. Paying for gas, parking, public transportation, lunches, coffee, extra childcare, you name it. We don’t talk about that enough. Nor the fact that our lives have a better balance. Yet weren’t they paying for those same things when they were in office before the pandemic? They’ve gotten a pay raise for the few years they’ve been working from home with not having those expenses. Exactly. It’s a pay raise they got, and now they are losing that pay raise. People get upset when a pay raise is clawed back. (in this case substitute “benefit” for “pay raise” if necessary). Except that pay raise was immediately eaten up by inflation that wages didn’t keep up with. Yes, and no one likes having their pay raise taken away. Yep. Bonus points if they haven’t gotten a raise in their paycheck or a raise that didn’t keep up with inflation (which has been huge in the last few years). Which has been my situation for over a decade. The biggest “pay increase” that I got was being able to work remotely. Just the savings in fuel and car insurance are a noticeable change. RTO is essentially a blatant pay cut. Yes? And walking back a pay raise is by definition a pay cut. Since the commenter said their company has been dealing with layoffs for 2 years, that makes me think their employees have not had a raise or bonus in those two years. Which means they are behind where money is concerned even if they are remote. If you go remote and it is seen as, you are saving money so technically this is a raise, fine. For the first year that is true. At year 2 it is no longer a raise, it is where your compensation falls. So at that point, if you are asked to come back in AND given no raise, you are losing money. Same for anyone hired as a remote worker. If all I have known with a company is being remote and they turn around and tell me I have to come in, I am going to feel like I am losing compensation that I bargained for, because now I have potentially thousands extra in costs a year that were not there when I started the job. It is absolutely a pay cut to go from being remote to in office. Also restaurants are a lot more expensive now. Most COL are about 3%. While rents dipped for a time, they have risen with a vengeance. Utilities, and food have risen in price much more than that since 2020. My rent has gone up by 50% since 2020, for example. (and before anybody suggests moving, what I’m paying is simply what a similar, few-frills apartment costs in my area, there simply is no place to move that is cheaper without giving up things like closets, being able to fit my sofa into the living room, being able to see a tree) Extra childcare? If your commute means you take another hour to pick up your kid, that’s one more hour of childcare every day that’s needed. Possibly two if you also need to drop them off earlier in the morning. Or if you have older children that don’t need constant supervision and you can easily work with them home, but they are not old enough to be home alone (I’m not a parent, but I’m thinking about 10ish-year-olds) This is my situation. My kids are old enough to take care of themselves while I finish work after they get out of school, but not old enough to stay home alone. If I had to return to the office, I’d have to pay for 5 days of afterschool childcare a week (if I could even find it, programs fill up as soon as registration opens around here), while also paying for extra gas and exorbitant parking costs. Correct! This is exactly my case, my kids are 9 and 12, old enough to entertain themselves for 3 hours, but not old enough to be left alone for that same period of time. We use our lunch hour to pick them up from school, and then we continue working for a few more hours with them on their tablets or tv or whatnot. If we had to go back to office full time, we would have to pay for someone or someplace for them to be taken care of, and in California that means several hundred dollars more a month for just 3 hours a day. The CEO has had a reality check already – his reality is that the people who work for him aren’t paying attention to instructions. And it sounds like the LW and other people in senior leadership have attempted to give him that reality check but it hasn’t worked – so now what do they do? Two points jump out at me: The discussion about why to mandate RTO makes not even a nod to getting the work done; and the LW believes (likely correctly) that the CEO is a petulant child. Some jobs can be done just fine remotely, while others cannot. If the job works fine done remotely, insisting on RTO will put the company at a competitive disadvantage. Some other company in the same business but without the RTO hang-up will be at a huge advantage in recruitment and retention. And if your CEO actually makes critical business decisions based on his fee-fees being hurt, this is a huge problem even apart from RTO. I’d love to chart this out somehow. I’d say some percent of jobs – rarely whole fields – are significantly more effective to do at home as long as you have the right employee in place. Some of course can’t be remote or even flexibly at all – shift coverage on-site jobs. But maybe there’s 10% of jobs that are basically solitary and require a lot of deep uninterrupted thinking time and experience a significant boost. Then there’s the vast category in the middle (speaking only of white collar office fields) where there’s maybe a measurable markdown of value to the employer – but to the employee it’s such a coveted benefit that it could be worth it in retention/attracting talent. Seventy-five percent of a truly excellent employee is worth 100% of a mediocre one in most roles, not all. I have read reports and seen figures for this in the UK, and without looking them up I think it’s about 1/3 of jobs went fully remote during Covid, and the vast majority of those have gone to hybrid, with full-time employees expected to spend 2-3 days a week in the office and part-time employees pro-rata’d to 40-60%. There are a few employers who have either gone fully remote (usually smaller organisations who were renting office space and have realised they don’t actually need it), or who have mandated full-time in-office work, but these are both rare and not indicative of larger trends. I have seen one commentator say that the UK is diverging from the US on this issue — which I think may be because our distances just aren’t as great and our population is more concentrated, so hybrid actually works for the vast majority of people. Working 2 days a week in office means people can tolerate somewhat longer commutes than working 5 days in the office, and for most people the benefits don’t aggregate significantly if you go to fully remote. Like, yes, technically you could move to the the Highlands if you were fully remote, but the number of people who want to do that is pretty small. Whereas the number of people who can now take jobs up to 2 hours away has significantly increased. And actually a lot of us do appreciate 1-3 days in the office even if we don’t want to do it every day. I actually like hybrid as an employee, but from the organization’s standpoint it’s the least efficient for cost savings, because they still have to have office space to fit everybody (especially if they want in-office days to be the same for most staff like “everyone on Mondays” – and if they *don’t* do that, they get the “why did I have to drive in just to have all-remote meetings with other people who aren’t in the office” issue) – and they mean most employees have to have a fully kitted out home office as well. I done manage office space but I’ve been in meetings about it and I think the discussion was that at 3 days in-office you need so close to 100% office space,l that it makes no difference, but at 2 days a week there’s a substantial saving — you’re looking at 60-80% of the full time equivalent, as long as it’s well-designed for hot desking and you’ve got a mixture of other spaces for confidential meetings, casual meetings, etc. *don’t manage office space, that should say! I think the other reason we’re diverging is the cost of accommodation in London especially. If you are living in a tiny flat or a house share where you have a rota for the use of the table, it’s a lot less appealing to work remotely. Also you have to heat it and pay for WiFi and electricity costs are going up. I think the excessive cost of property either rental or owned in London is a factor. Almost all my younger and more junior colleagues in London want to be in more often because they have a better working environment that way. It was definitely true for me when I was early-career; I was sharing a house with four people, so I would not have wanted to work from home at all (although even then I would have coveted flexible hours at least). That’s just London, though, right? I have multiple friends in the UK, and they (and the other people at their companies) work almost exclusively from home, which is their preference. Only one of them is in London, though. Yup! Outside of London, the option is often smallish place close to work or plenty of space with a bit of a longer commute, but one which is perfectly doable for most for 2-3 days a week, and allows a home office and a lot more nice house stuff (a garden, or a walkable life when not at work, or whatever). Another key difference between UK and US is the PTO. UK has much better PTO practices and protections than the US. And that’s without factoring in that the UK parental leave is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better. I’m curious about the UK childcare practices. That’s a big issue for anyone with kids in the US (childcare is expensive and can be hard to find in some areas). Is the UK the same or different? Really not much better, as far as I can tell. It’s not too hard to find childcare where I am (some parts of the country it is), but in 2020 when my youngest started school we were paying £926 a month for Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, which was the government subsidised rate for 3-4 year olds. For unsubsidised 0-2 year olds back then it was £1400 a month for one child full-time. We’re in a medium CoL area, and there’s been significant inflation since then, plus increases to the minimum wage, both of which childcare is very exposed to, so it’lll be a lot more now. The thing that does make a big difference is that flexible working and part-time work is much more common, so it’s not all or nothing. I’ve work 60%, 80% and 90% of full time hours over the last ten years, and that’s been totally ok with 5 different employers, 4 of which were advertising full-time jobs but were fine with me asking for 0.8 or 0.9 contracts. So we haven’t actually full-time childcare since 2017, when my second child was born. That second paragraph is really interesting. I haven’t really seen any U.S. employer that was okay with a FT role becoming 80% or 90%. And it’s pretty rare for the U.S. to do contracts. We have the right to request flexible working (which includes part-time), and can’t be penalised for it (obviously that’s the theory, and a bad manager can retaliate just like they can for any other protected characteristic or act.) The bar for saying no is legally pretty low— if you’ve advertised a job as full-time, it’s pretty straightforward to say,”no, we need someone full-time”. But culturally, especially in most large organisations and the public sector, there’s a strong trend towards saying yes if you can make it work. Especially if you’re talking about someone working a 4 day werk or a 9 day fortnight, it’s quite widely assumed that the workload won’t be that much lower, the impact on morale is high, and it’s cheaper for the employer. And any large employer will have an HR and payroll system which very easily copes with pro-rata-ing pay, pension, benefits, annual leave etc. Yep – I don’t have kids but the majority of my friends who had children went back to work on a part-time basis after their maternity leave. We’re in our mid-forties now so the kids are older, and some of my friends have gone back up to five days a week, but some of them have stuck with three or four days. My sister does four days a week now. In my industry (book publishing) it’s very, very common for women who have children to negotiate to come back part-time or four days a week after their maternity leave. I’d say it’s so common that I’d almost expect it. And even before Covid, plenty of women negotiated a hybrid working pattern – say they’d be in the office Monday/Tuesday, work from home Wednesday/Thursday, and that would be their four days a week. And of course now we’re all hybrid – and we have flexible hours so if you have kids you can start later so you can do the school run in the morning and whatnot. I think publishing has always been very open to more flexible working (possibly because there are a lot of women in publishing). As you say, everything’s pro-rated and that’s also very normal, so it’s not a problem for a company to deal with pro-rated holiday, salary etc etc. Or there are jobs which can be done equally as well either in office or remote — remote doesn’t have to be either more effective or less effective to be a benefit a lot of workers want. During lockdown, we discovered that some parts of our jobs were better in person (but we lived with the online/remote version because we had to), some parts were just as effective (different, but same value and outcome), and some parts were better remote/online. After the lockdown we were told we had to come back in office fulltime. We lost several very good employees that way. Upper management was convinced eventually to allow hybrid — 3 days in office, 2 days remote. We could actually be just as effective with one or two days in office, but most of us are reconciled to the schedule we have. I think there are also jobs where there’s positive value to hybrid. People on my team need to be able to collaborate, work together informally, have in-depth discussions in office, have spontaneous chats when they run into each other, etc. But many of them also need to write, or code, or otherwise concentrate for some stretch of time, and that’s harder to do in open cubes. Hybrid gives people some flexibility to benefit from in-person interaction but also have some time with fewer distractions for more focused work. There’s also the fact that since we went remote and then came back hybrid, my work/life boundaries have blurred in ways that are beneficial to my employer. If I have a medical appointment I take much less time off if I’m in the routine of easily logging on from home afterwards, compared to when we were fully in-office and I didn’t even have a work laptop, just a desktop. I’m also way more likely to check Teams and email from the waiting room at that appointment, which isn’t good for me but is good for my employer. I would probably be less grouchy about RTO as a trend if I hadn’t spend the last five years before I went to remote watching office quality descend hellishly lower and lower. I’m sorry, but if you’ve implemented squished open benches into echoey high-ceiling warehouses that you’re calling “hot desking” – you can’t be surprised that workers don’t want to be there. I couldn’t even concentrate for five minutes at my last job before I went remote. Our office is decent by current standards – people have assigned cubes, it’s a newly remodeled building, we all have sit/stand desks, the kitchen facilities are well-maintained, conference room tech mostly work well, pretty much everyone gets a bit of sunlight, etc. The cubes are a reasonable size and have above-desk-height dividers and another foot or so of frosted glass above that, coming to maybe chest height? But still, people can hear others on the phone, see and hear them walking by, and the exact same informal collaboration or question from a neighbor that provides some of the benefits of in-person work also creates distractions. Yes! My office does hotdesking, and if all the people who could go in, went in, we would run out of desks. The biggest issue is for HR and Finance, who don’t have their own office. They regularly deal with sensitive information and don’t have a place in the office where they can handle it. Second biggest issue is the people who work with team members and clients remotely. I’ve had days where I went to the office, then spent the majority of the day in a closet on calls to people in other timezones. Yeah, I would be willing to do hybrid or maybe full RTO if I had a semi-private workspace. I would immediately be searching for another job if they wanted me to return to open-office hell. Yup I can do some of my work as a physician from home (paperwork, patient calls, telehealth visits) I know a psychiatrist who works now entirely from home doing telehealth A surgeon can do almost none of their work from home Even within our office Our scheduler cannot do any of her work from home as she checks patients in and out from live appointments Our health coach, who also does some scheduling, can do some of her work from home The best professional relationship I have right now at work is with someone at another site I have met once in person but we chat online all the time about shared patients and resources. The complicating factor is that what is more effective for an individual job isn’t necessarily more effective for the department, or company, as a whole. I worked at a software company that mostly had a really annoying butts in seats mentality. But they allowed work from home when an ice storm shut things down. The senior programmer was much more productive on work from home days. They spent a not insignificant amount of time in office answering questions and brainstorming with other developers. But their loss in productivity was more than offset by the benefits of their mentorship to other people, to the company (and also to their own job satisfaction.) Right. Sometimes it’s a win-win, sometimes it’s more of a tradeoff between the org’s benefits and the employee’s benefits. But most of us aren’t rewarded on the job for the work we help others accomplish – we have our own productivity metrics that we’re being evaluated on. Many managers tend to see it as a waste of the senior person’s time! The senior person is working on important, super challenging stuff. They’re super productive. They don’t have time to be interrupted by the junior person’s 100 questions on something unimportant. So I take “developing juniors” to be sort of BS. Strong agree! My company lost 100% of the people who were hired during our covid WFH within 3 years of their coming on board, compared to most people staying 5-10 years and people retiring after 30 not being unusual. The new folks were not getting the kind of informal support and mentoring that naturally occurs when you can pop your head into someone else’s office for a quick question. Normally we hire junior engineers straight out of college and groom them for management. Last year we had to hire someone into a management position from outside the company for the first time in over a decade because we don’t have the pipeline of talent ready. I think the AAM commentariat in general is way too focused on it being better for them to finish their individual work and unwilling to acknowledge how their individual deliverables are not the end all be all. This jumped out at me too: are the remote workers getting their work done? That’s the dispositive question in this whole argument. LW mentions that their team is high-functioning; is that true of the company in general? If it is, and the CEO is swayed by news reports or studies, someone should show him the Pew research study about remote workers. (I’ll drop the link in a reply.) Not only is a return-to-office mandate a resume generating event, but the likelihood that employees will leave instead of giving up remote work is tied to their overall job satisfaction. If LW’s weariness, late hours, crappy clients and low morale are shared by other high-performing employees, the business may lose more people than it can afford. Will remote employees leave if ordered back to the office? Survey says: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/13/many-remote-workers-say-theyd-be-likely-to-leave-their-job-if-they-could-no-longer-work-from-home/ Some other company in the same business but without the RTO hang-up will be at a huge advantage in recruitment and retention. This, plus the cost savings from not requiring a large office footprint and the associated real estate and utility costs. If commercial real estate costs $0.50/sqft/month, and each employee requires as little as 150 sqft, remote work saves them at least $75/month per employee, plus electric expenses. Call it $1000/employee per year. Downtown San Jose is around $3/sqft/mo, or $36/sqft/year. Multiply that by 150 sqft/per employee, and in-office costs a minimum of $5,400/employee/year. Not chump change. This will become a competitive advantage for the companies that manage for it. We’re supposedly back in the office full time, too, supposedly with no exceptions. It’ll be interesting to see what happens in February. Will we get talked to if we worked from home? I decided to not ask permission and just do it. I’m going to let the chips fall where they may. I should clarify that I come in most of the time. However, I will work from home around doctor appointments so I don’t have to take a full day off. Those are the chips that will fall, if any. I also asked for a raise. They need to understand that this decision has consequences. Okay but what do you do if they just decide to fire you? Are you at least telling your manager that you’re working from home on those days or just fully going rogue? Well, they could always decide to terminate my contract and try to replace me. That’ll cost them a lot and maybe even force them to hire more than one person to replace me. I will tell my managers, though. They know why I’m doing it, too, so I hope that helps my case. This makes sense to me. I have seen so many “policies” get enforced for a month then quietly die. Or be unenforceable to a ridiculous degree. Or get quietly ignored by some people but not others. It’s always interesting how it actually plays out. I’ve also quietly “forgotten” about certain policies that had no practical value and were simply in place at a senior leader’s whims. Usually they end up falling by the wayside. Unpopular opinion but I don’t have a lot of sympathy for the “junior employees need an in-person experience” line of argument, TBH. Is it probably true? Yes, maybe, although if the future of office work is trending towards being increasingly remote (at least in some fields) then maybe we should all be cultivating a generation with those skills, I don’t know. But more importantly as someone who’s not in management and isn’t paid to be in management, as an individual contributor, this is not a cromulent reason for me personally to waste time and resources on a commute to sit in a cube farm on hybrid zoom meetings all a day. Exactly. If management wants experienced employees to mentor junior employees, then put it in their goals and pay them for it. “Model appropriate office behavior” is something that is in the basic code of conduct most people sign to be hired. This isn’t formal mentoring or training. It would be easier to quantify if it was. Helping your coworkers when they have questions, modeling what they’re supposed to do, and continuously improving your own skills are basic assumptions of any job. Note – by continuously improving your own skills, I don’t mean “go out and get specific education in X”. I mean that when most people start there are some things at a company they are not as good at, from specific tech things to company procedures. A baseline unspoken expectation is that after some period of time, you should be able to perform those skills without needing support. This. I used to get dinged on my performance reviews for spending too much time helping junior team members and not doing my baloney projects. Thank you. What experience are junior employees getting anyway if everyone is stuck away in zoom meetings all day anyway? The lunchroom, water cooler talk isn’t really enough to justify taking morale completely. Oh and junior employees can pick up on bad morale just fine in person. Why is it that these discussions always seem to default to, “oh if we’re full-time in the office, everyone’s just sitting on Zoom”? Obviously SOME offices are like that, but I’m willing to bet that most aren’t! Even in-person meetings, the modeled in-office behavior I saw was my manager picking at his toenails while talking to us or the owner of the company having a screaming match with the head developer in our mostly-open office. Unless they mean the strangled smile you give to your coworkers as you walk to and from the bathroom or learning how to handle 40 hours a week of 3 people loudly talking about Gisele’s ex-husband Tom Brady. I tend to agree. I get it, I really do – we’ve had a few new people start since 2020 and I can see how much more difficult it is for them to get to grips with everything when it’s 90% Teams chat and video calls. It’s so much trickier than just being able to turn to someone sitting next to you and say ‘Can you show me how this bit of the database works?’ or whatever. And I agree that for junior members of staff, there isn’t that same immersion in people chatting about projects, hearing people taking phone calls, seeing how they interact, etc etc. But at the same time…I’m an experienced individual contributor, I’m not in management, and I don’t really buy the ‘we want people to have some office time because it’s better for collaboration’ stuff. I don’t *mind* going in – and luckily we’re only in two days a week – but I really wouldn’t want to do any more than two days a week. If I could do just one, I would, because honestly it would make my work-life balance so much better. I’m more productive at home than I am in the office, because there are fewer distractions, and I can do my job just as well from home as I can from the office. I realise that’s not the situation for everyone, and I particularly feel for young people trying to WFH in houseshares etc – I can see why being in the office would be beneficial for them. But personally, in my role, there’s no need for me to be dragging myself into the office twice a week just for the sake of physically sitting in the same room as my co-workers. And I think there are other solutions to the problem of it being more difficult for new employees. Like everyone new gets a “buddy” who is friendly and approachable and is their acknowledged go-to for questions they’d prefer not to ask their manager. and bonus if that person is one of the extroverts who chooses to regularly work from the office, or people who finds they work better with a commute to a different place, or someone who craves more person time and enjoys that work – match up the work to suit the needs of the people. I love mentoring, but not if I have to do it all in person, so I need to be careful about who I mentor (nearly all my mentoring has ended up being for people using similar skillsets but at different sites so even if we’re both in office we’re not in the same place, which means it’s easy and logical to build online ways of connecting most of the time). I’m not sure that’s the right way to look at it, though. Your employer is allowed to ask you to do all kind of things that you don’t personally find worthwhile. IF there is a real benefit to the employer of having people in the office to mentor junior staff (I realize that is a big “if”), then they are allowed to decide that in-person attendance is a required part of the job, regardless if you personally feel that it’s a good use of your time — just like being on call off hours, or extensive travel, or whatever other demands any job may make. Then you are allowed to choose to keep or leave that job. I’ve also found that a lot – a _lot_ – of that “mentoring” look a lot like “benign neglect” (if not “hazing”). Shockingly, training people is hard, even through skills emulation, and very few people are really aware of what behaviors they’re modeling. At best, it becomes a social “do as I say, not as I do” (capstoned by all these RTO CEOs zooming in from their beach house). It also takes time to do this, in the form of the new employee asking questions and interrupting workflows and the mentor having to figure out the answer and how to contextualize the answer. Double all of this for any new employee who’s neurodivergent and is thrown into a neurotypical office, quad it for all of the pits of vipers I’ve seen in so many offices. Thank you. If something is important enough to learn by osmosis, it’s important enough to be formally trained on! But employers don’t want to invest time in training new staff or further developing older staff, so rather than build workloads that can accommodate taking time for peer-to-peer professional development or whatever, we just hope someone overhears Fergus handling a client really well on the phone and decides to put that into practice themselves. I feel similarly about “hallway conversations” that in-office proponents feel are somehow the bedrock of workplace collaboration. I appreciate that seeing someone randomly in the hall might trigger a reminder that you needed to talk to Arya about XYZ, but this isn’t collaboration! This is what happens when you don’t have formalized processes or clear communication trees, etc. And even when you have those things, stuff can go wrong because we’re human. The solution isn’t “make sure you’re in the office to accidentally overhear/run into people,” and my colleagues forget to loop me into things just as often when I’m physically present as they do when I’m at home. If something is important enough to learn by osmosis, it’s important enough to be formally trained on! This is 100% wrong. Tribal knowledge and informal learning are, in fact, things. What is an example of “tribal knowledge” in the workplace? Segars, Creating a Tribal Approach for Innovation in Organizations, Harvar led Business Review 2019 Plenty of other literature out there on the subject too Hi, professional here! I am literally paid to help offices decide what to train on (consultant). “Learning by osmosis” isn’t actually a thing. It’s actually learning by observing and applying, often with a side of applying under guidance. It can have an important role in training, and I often include it as part of a formal training program. “Formal training” doesn’t mean “be lectured at”. It means having a dedicated structure of learning. Experiential learning is often a key part of that, and it often benefits from a formal structure! If experiential learning is left to the whim of the team, often there are elements that get overlooked. Even having a simple required checklist of activities that the person should experience under guidance is a huge benefit and improves both learning and morale. Thank you! I have a training component in my job, and as far as I’m concerned “formal training” means “we made a decision that staff need to know XYZ and someone will be delivering that content in a manner appropriate to the task and the staff.” “Learning by osmosis” isn’t actually a thing. It’s actually learning by observing and applying, often with a side of applying under guidance. You’re taking the term “osmosis” very literally. It’s shorthand for exactly what you describe, and WFH impedes what you describe, no mate what moniker you put on it. Having worked with a lot of teams to improve their L&D practices, plenty of people do interpret “learning by osmosis” literally. I’ve seen soooo many managers assume that just because someone is working next to an expert, they are learning from the expert. Meanwhile the expert ignores the (supposed) trainee and the trainee is having to learn in isolation (despite being physically next to someone). WFH does not impede learning by observation, but it is a different practice than what you might do in an office. There needs to be a lot more explicit communication. For example, we use a mandated checklist in observational learning and guided practice (i.e., watching someone do the thing, then having someone watch you do the thing) because otherwise people inevitably forget 1 thing out of 20 (especially because training isn’t their day job!). Remote people need to explicitly communicate- “hey, I’m going to be working on llama braids today, do you want to watch me?” rather than the trainee being able to say “hey, it looks like you might be working on llama braids- can I watch you?” Of course, different individuals have different communication styles, and some have a much tougher time training online rather than in-person. So results may vary if you just pick an expert on your team and say “teach someone”. Teaching is its own skill, and remote teaching is it’s own specialization within that. I trained people half a world away through only an IRC client, not even screen sharing, with a partial language barrier and a time zone barrier. The impedance is psychological. OMG, thank you for your last paragraph!! My last boss bragged that he managed by walking around, he was one of the first people to go back to the office after covid restrictions were lifted, and he complained often that the other offices were empty when he walked around. This isn’t collaboration!!! If you have to depend on just ‘running into’ people for collaboration, it might never happen. Why not just set a meeting or time to talk? And he also refused/seemed to hate formalized processes and clear communication trees. Your comment encapsulated all my feelings about this lol I don’t mind coming into the office, but it’s so much better when there’s some intentionality behind it. There is a benefit to in office work but it doesn’t happen unless you make it happen. If junior staff members need training and support, schedule “office hours”. If you’re wanting innovation, lay out what your key issues are and schedule workshops focusing on that. I agree with you; even if some soft skills and adjustments to work culture can be learned by observation, employers cheaping out on training, and leaving it to colleges and unpaid internships, I think is a disaster. This is how you get mismatches on both sides with “no one is hiring” on the one hand and “we can’t find the right people” on the other. Employers need to step up and do SOME training. 2008 really messed with a lot of minds. Absolutely. Lots of things are learned by observation, but you can formalize that observation process instead of just hoping a learning opportunity presents itself. Like my phone call example: instead of just hoping to be around when Fergus makes a call and discovering on your own that he’s good at it, a manager who knows Fergus is an ace on the phone can easily say “Okay, Arya, you’re going to shadow Fergus on his sales calls for the next couple of days so you can see how he does it. Make sure to pay close attention to the way he re-directs conversation if XYZ happens so that he doesn’t lose the sale.” One place I worked was famous for impromptu hallway meetings that were actually very effective. But at that place everyone was in offices, sometimes two to an office, and the custom was to close your door when you were heads down on something. So hallway convos were not disturbing to the people in their offices, it made the meetings very short (we didn’t have enough conference rooms anyway) and effective. This was a job that had a large field work (plus prep and post) component, so it made sense to have everyone there. My previous job was hybrid before the pandemic and went 100% remote during the pandemic. We would frequently hire entry-level employees – actual entry-level, often straight out of college with little to no work experience. We trained them extensively. Multiple presentations and many practice exercises and then when they were released to work they were paired with a more experienced person to answer questions and review their work for the first few months. Almost every experienced employee on the team took on a different leg of training so new hires could get to know their team members. We were a cameras on culture so new staff could put a face to the name. Experienced staff were expected to be kind, open, and available to help less experienced people. If they were not that would have been considered a problem. Newbies we hired during the pandemic learned their jobs just as quickly as those we hired before the pandemic. There were performance issues for some, sure, but they were issues those people would have had regardless of if they were in person or remote. Based on what I saw here I do not think learning by osmosis is a good enough reason to require in-person work, generally speaking. New employees, especially entry-level, need a ton of support and things spelled out for them no matter where they are working. I work for a remote-only company, and this is such an issue that we no longer hire entry-level people and just do entry-level work at the middle level. I’m a strong proponent of remote work, but every recent grad we have hired has struggled to the point of needing to be fired (after a long PIP and lots of coaching.) I strongly believe there are some workplace skills that most entry-level people cannot pick up in a fully-remote environment. I would include myself in that category, and my decade in an office did me well. When I was interviewing people last year for an in office job, we got lots of people wanting remote. Even if we did do remote, people with no experience in my industry (customs brokerage/international transportation) would massively struggle to learn what we do remote. You have to be sitting next to the person training you. I’ve seen people with no experience really struggle even being trained in person. Someone with experience going remote at a new job is a totally different hing. Recently seen on Twitter Three people interview for a job. Two of them want remote work. One says “I want to be in office so that I can learn the business.” Which one do you think the company (ceteris parabus) will pick? This really depends. I worked in many companies where this would be the case. After working two jobs that treated WFH as a “necessary evil” and a “drain on the company” I applied for a job that required only 2 days physically in the office, and a lot of independent tasks visiting sites for a day and then returning home to write reports and briefs. They wanted someone who was capable of independent work and didn’t need to be baby sat in an office all day. My mention of not being bothered by coming into the office and only WFH in emergencies was actually NOT viewed as a positive. Front line manager here, I agree that the world has changed and we should find ways to support new staff and integrate them into the team. It takes less effort in person, but I see that as something to deal with rather than a reason to be more in person. Seems like a bad manager problem. And if most everyone is teleworking, they are not going to be there for new staff anyway. Maybe the supervisor and a buddy will for the first few months, but not the whole team. If people have staggered schedules, it’s likely that people will be in virtual meetings and/or rarely or never being in the office the same days. Having someone come in to a largely empty office hurts their experience and integration. There was a letter last week that had this very problem, where the LW’s potential new workplace wanted them to be 100% in office for the first six months of the job, after which they’d be allowed to WFH parrt-time. Except everyone else was part-time since they weren’t new hires, so I couldn’t figure out what having the LW in 100% of the time was going to accomplish. Vehemently disagree, from experience. In fact this is one of the reasons I left a management job in 2023. Absolutely everyone claims to work greatly at home, but so many problems would fester, and yes, younger people fell behind and did not learn by osmosis. I was constantly trying to force trainings and interactions remotely, but it’s only partially effective. People online make it sound very robotic as if I just schedule a training and suddenly everyone is a perfect employee. It’s not like that IRL. IRL it’s junior person watching someone else (even subconsciously by sitting near them) and learning everything from a dozen keyboard shortcuts to listening to someone put a customer in their place so they know how far they can push boundaries. It also became a problem replacing myself. I’d keep end up putting out fires alone and no one learned what I was doing. I’d try recapping stuff later on and could tell people were only half listening And these were otherwise good people, the type you’d screen 500 resumes for a position before covid for. So I’ve gotten very skeptical of people claiming WFH is 100% perfect in every situation Yes, for a lot of people it’s harder to train someone remotely. I’ve done it over IRC, not even screen sharing, but it takes three times as long. With Zoom and screen sharing, it is easier, but not the same as in-person. I just don’t think the solution is to give up and require lengthy commutes and butts in seats. I would love to work from home full time, but I disagree that it’s not a good reason to work in-office. Those of us who came up working in the office full time picked up a lot just by being there, seeing other people work, seeing how people reacted to things/handled stuff, hearing conversations. There’s a *lot* you learn without formal training. We got the benefit of that, and so should younger people. Plus, it is to our benefit to have younger coworkers who gain that knowledge, so we don’t have to deal with them 5-10 years down the line when they are behind where they should be. I still wish I could be full time wfh, but I do see a benefit This is why companies need to invest in L&D (learning and development). A lot of companies over-rely on modeling to train junior employees. When the junior employees are remote or their team is remote, there are less opportunities to observe others and therefor model what they do. (side note- modeling wasn’t the most successful version to begin with. It worked great if you had someone who was dedicated to the training, but if your trainer checked out, you were just SOL) The over-reliance on modeling can definitely be replaced through other learning mediums. Formalized shadowing practices are often extremely helpful, and it means that things are less likely to fall through the cracks. Having a designated point of contact for questions and regular check-ins on progress is essential. A scheduled discussion about cultural elements, expectations, and what questions to ask your manager about team culture can troubleshoot sooo many potential issues! And these things can be designed to have a very low lift- for most teams that are good at training junior staff, it’s just a formalized version of what they already do. And a good L&D can design the process to support what’s already going right while filling in the gaps of what’s going wrong. When I was a junior employee I don’t remember my development being a priority for senior employees at all. I could ask my direct coworkers who maybe had a year or two under their belt but that’s about it. I’ve done two on-site onboardings, two pure-remote onboardings, and one hybrid (onsite for 6 of the first 8 weeks, then offsite 100%). I can’t make generalizations between which ones went better based on where I was physically, but I can make them based on whether or not the employer had an agenda of work for me to do and a plan to get me up to speed. My remote on-boarding went pretty smoothly! Because we have a ton of resources and procedures and etc to use and a strong culture of working remotely. unfortunately they make us all commute to offices to work remotely from each other. Agreed. I’ve done lots of on-site onboardings, and three remote onboardings. In both cases, if they didn’t have a list of everything, it took much, much longer. The on-site wasn’t generally any better because without a good checklist, you didn’t know what you didn’t know. There is nothing that makes your first month at a company more miserable than sitting in an office unable to do any work because no one has set up your access to things or even pointed you at any documentation. I have endured this on a couple occasions on-site. Remote onboarding does require both a checklist and a “shepherd” – a person to help you get access and to help troubleshoot issues. Same, I quit a job after a year because I was never trained or taught. After the first week they said “figure it out”, and I never did, despite being in the office 5 days a week. The company culture struggled massively with learning and development and they knew it–even pre-COVID! So this can’t be the main reason to force people to sit in an office all day. The answer has to be more nuanced and more case-by-case. Personal and professional development isn’t a compelling enough reason for you? (genuinely asking) I have a junior employee who asked me for a list of all active employees in the company and their location for a project. This employee doesn’t have the access to pull all the employees including senior level in each area so I sent it. I sent an Excel spreadsheet. The reply? “I thought you were going to send me separate lists for each department.” Um. I sent you the most filterable list format on the planet. But getting this employee to THINK instead of expecting others to do it for them is… not fun. This employee fully WFH? Oh goodness. I am to put it mildly skeptical of RTO requirements and question whether a rigid/blanket policy makes sense for most businesses, but it’s odd that the CEO has made this clear and it isn’t happening. It’s no surprise the staff is not returning to work when it seems the LW as a senior leader is making their dislike of the policy clear, and there seem to be no consequences for people simply refusing to come in. Alison is right, LW needs to make their case about this policy clear in discussion with the CEO, but once the CEO makes the decision that is it, it’s part of LW’s job to implement the policy and it’s apparent they are not doing that at all. I don’t buy these excuses from the staff, they simply don’t want to commute (incidentally maybe the fact that they have “nonstop meetings” to look forward to on arrival is a factor?). Multiple sick pets is up there with “the dog ate my homework” for juvenile excuses. If this has to happen, make it happen. Refusal to come in means warnings, repeat offense means ineligibility for raises and/or dismissal. At this point it seems you are saying “we tried nothing, and THAT didn’t work. What else can we possibly do!?”. The point that’s interesting to me in this letter is less about which format we each like and more about the ability for the leadership of private companies to choose their strategy. Doesn’t the CEO get to pick how he wants to run his business in this case? If it doesn’t work for a lot of the staff and they leave, and the company has a hard time finding new staff, that will be the business outcome of the CEO’s decision. A competing company might be going the other direction. When front-line staff and mid-level management deliberately oppose the corporate mandate, I think it causes trouble. I completely agree and that’s why I end up at “just call the question already!” Get on the table what’s going to happen and how it’s going to be enforced and let it play out however it’s going to play out; staying in this tense limbo is just prolonging things. I think this is a great point. I totally get why people might prefer to work from home, why it would be upsetting to be told you have to come in when you’d rather not, or even why someone might refuse to stay in a job that requires in-office work. But I’m always puzzled by the levels of extreme outrage!!! that we see anytime a company requires workers to come in. Company owners/management are allowed to make these decisions, even if they’re bad decisions, and workers are allowed to find a new job if they think it’s unreasonable. Unfortunately it’s not so easy to find a new job these days. Sorry, but if your workers overwhelmingly prefer one work mode over the other, it makes more sense for the CEO to compromise. Corporations and executives already have so much power over workers’ lives–this is one area where they should be willing to give. But of course I was so fed up with this kind of thing that I decided to work for myself. The CEO DoD “compromise” on three days in office per week. Having been given an inch, LW decided to take a mile. She “compromised” further by unilaterally deciding that two days was sufficient. The CEO’s decision to end it altogether would be a natural consequence of this “gimme an inch, I’ll take a mile” attitude. Unfortunately, many good employees don’t care for an organizational culture that treats them like wayward children. And many bosses don’t care for a workforce who’re behaving like wayward children. Your point? The CEO did compromise. A lot of people are very inertia-driven when it comes to changing jobs, and will invest a ton of energy into trying to change a bad job rather than looking for a new one. For some people it’s for very good reasons — like there not being a lot of opportunities in their field or in this location, or having a salary / benefits / lifestyle factors that would be really hard to meet elsewhere — but sometimes it really is just an irrational belief that you Can’t Leave because [quitting is bad / I owe them something / job seeking is scary]. Personally I have never stayed in a job longer than 3 years and am very comfortable job-seeking, so it’s a mindset I don’t really get! But it is absolutely a real thing, and there are often some quite strong responses when people suggest that LWs start jobsearching. But workers are also allowed to complain and try to change the minds of managers. And sometimes that works. I was at an org at one point that was talking about moving my team to a less-convenient location. There was a resounding response of “if you do this, we will leave.” They did not do it. And that was better for everyone then if they’d done it and the team had quit. The problem is that’s not what the employees did. If they actually did get together and say “we’re not doing this for X reasons [list of reasons that are beneficial for the company]”, they would have had some power. “We have to take international calls – these are just as easily done from home as from the office, and results in X% fewer calls having issues because someone got caught in traffic” is a business case. Instead they just…didn’t come in. But if people have moved further away during the WFH period, you at least need to give them lead time to consider/try to moving back closer to the office (and to try to negotiate for whatever raise is now needed to make it feasible to live close enough to commute). Sounds like the CEO just tried to yank everyone back into the office without sufficient time to adapt, and everyone dug in in response, resulting in this battle. And like others have said, the CEO needs to recognize the pay cut associated with forcing people back into the office. Upper management needed a plan for how to handle these obstacles and costs involved in returning to the office, instead of just a mandate that ignored practicalities. Yeah, call the question, set the firm in-office date for n months out, then start negotiating where needed. And prepare for some people (possibly your highest performers) to quit. It’s not really a pay cut if these jobs were never intended to be remote, but only went remote temporarily because of Covid. It would be more logical to consider that the Covid period was a bonus. Everyone was rightly infuriated at employers who made people come in during the pandemic. The vast majority of employers who did the right thing and allowed people to go remote never promised that it was a permanent arrangement. No, it’s still a pay cut. If it was only six months, it might be a temporary bonus. But after three or four years, it’s a change in effective pay. People get salty about effective pay cuts. This sounds like a recipe for losing a lot of good employees. Already people are struggling with workload, working till 11, burning out, and the CEO still thinks it’s not enough? Their way or the highway is more important? I don’t care if the CEO is right. They can be right all they want, but they will never, ever achieve what they want: a functional office with good employees. Honestly, everyone should start looking to jump ship. There is no hope here–put your energy where it counts: somewhere else. +1 although sadly I think we’re now heading for a crunch where more and more employers feel confident demanding complete RTO because there’s fewer places for employees to jump ship – particularly if they moved out to remote areas and only accept *fully* remote work. If most of the Federal workforce goes back … One thing I really like about DOGE is its policy of requiring the federal workforce to return to office. The NYT had a story about a librarian – a librarian! – at the Library of Congress who was aghast that she couldn’t work remotely forever from Ohio. Why should the federal government be subsidizing waste like this? If this was the CNN story, it wasn’t a librarian and they didn’t have an office to return to. https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/doge-remote-work-federal-employees/index.html She says she doesn’t have an office to return to because someone else moved into her space. So find her some other space. Problem solved. And it’s the height of arrogance to assume they’d hold the same space for her while she spent five years working from Ohio. You are complaining about someone who is -not a librarian-, that is, who has a job that can be done from home, who was told her job was remote, who does not want to move, and who is also pointing out there isn’t an office for her to go back to. (A problem that may be solvable, but is certainly not solvable by her.) IMO, providing an office, or even just a desk space, to someone who can do their job effectively from home is a waste of taxpayer funds. In-office, one-size-fits-all mandates are the height of inefficiency and waste. Do you think that librarians’ duties are limited to stamping the books when someone checks one out and reshelving the books when someone returns one? If you really want to identify waste in the federal government, you might read this: https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-open-letter-doge. I’ll quote: “Simply put: If you [DOGE] ’re trying to identify wasteful practices and spending by federal agencies, you’ll find a wealth of actionable issues that our [ProPublica’s] reporting has surfaced over the past 16 years.” I’ll take the word of actual entrepreneurs like Musk and Vivek who have built actual companies over pro publica Musk drove Twitter/X into the ground, and Tesla is also having issues, so not exactly a great example. Ah yes, what could possibly go wrong with Musk (who didn’t actually build any of his companies, he bought the majority of shares in existing companies) steering the federal workforce ship! Begging you to actually learn who Musk is. My goodness. Musk is not an entrepreneur. He comes in after a company has been started, pushes out the founders, and then takes credit for it. Quite frankly, the idea of running the government “like a business” is asinine. The closest would be a non-profit, not a for profit company. Those who advocate for the government to be run like a for-profit business understand neither government or business. How has this point been completely derailed by a news story you got wrong? My original point still stands, no matter how many exceptions to the rule are found. Why do you assume it’s waste? I don’t think most librarians spend the bulk of their time shelving physical books. If anything, it could be a cost save because Ohio is unquestionably cheaper than DC. 100%! Especially because most civilian federal agencies provide region-based pay, which means that employees in OH will almost certainly be paid less than those in similar, DC-based roles. Allowing remote work DOES save the government money. You lost any smidge of credibility you might’ve had by saying that. Yikes. Where do you get remote = waste? Whereas I think DOGE will be a complete and utter farce. Why should the taxpayers pay for office real estate that is not needed? Just so some oligarch can see butts in seats slaving away? No, that’s downright stupid. If the work can be effectively done without requiring office space, then to save the taxpayers money it should be remote. Especially in cities, office space can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per employee per year. Multiply that by the size of the federal workforce that can do their jobs remotely, and that’s not a small amount. I don’t want my taxpayer money wasted on frivolous in-office mandates from unelected oligarchs like Musk and Ramaswamy. Hell, I don’t want it wasted on mandates from elected officials who are just changing things to look like they are “doing something” about “government waste”, especially when their “doing something” costs more money! “This sounds like a recipe for losing a lot of good employees. ” When I saw the justification of “Well, Amazon is doing it” my first thought was “Yes, they’re hoping people quit so that they can reduce their workforce by attrition rather than layoffs.” I don’t know if that’s what’s happening with LW’s company; their CEO could be clueless or just really committed to in-office work. But I think five years into WFH becoming a super common thing, we should be really skeptical about mandates for being in the office five days per week for jobs that are predominately done on the computer or from a smart phone. When I saw the justification of “Well, Amazon is doing it,” that told me everything I needed to know about the CEO. Yeah, he’s a cargo-cult MBA CEO without an original thought in his head, just stuff from business school ten years ago or more. These people run businesses into the ground. A question I keep asking and no one ever really answers. All these companies with RTO mandates. Employees want to be fully remote, not hybrid, so there are resignations after the RTO mandates. What are all these folks going to do if they can’t find a fully remote position? It seems the fully remote positions are much fewer than a couple of years ago. Will they very grudgingly take a remote or in office position and plot their exit as soon as they can find something else? What if they jump ship for a remote position that turns out to be hybrid or fully in office? Yeah I do wonder about this. Sigh. At least I got to witness the brief moment of history where it seemed like workers had the upper hand for a moment. Nice while it lasted. I think some of it is just geography & commute. If I was working in Manhattan, but then went remote and moved far away, and then subsequently refused to RTO on 42nd street, I might not be opposed to an in-office role that’s an easy 10 minute drive away in Whereversville where I live now. I’m guessing some find remote positions (possibly at a pay cut or other loss, but if remote work is important enough to them, it could be worth it), and others find in-person or hybrid roles that suit their needs better (shorter commute, closer to their daycare, more flexible on medical appointments, earlier or later work hours, more PTO, a role they’re excited enough about to be worth the sacrifice, etc). Yes! There are lots of alternatives that aren’t either “this existing job/fully remote” or “this existing job, fully in the office.” I work for the government and my agency gave up the leases on a bunch if budings this year. The career people definitely don’t want us back in the office. The incoming political types keep saying they’re going to push it. Who knows what will happen, but RTO would cost millions just in the leases. This!! It is a waste of taxpayer money to lease office space that is not actually needed because the work can be done remotely. There’s been a lot of “well, I was thinking I’d work another couple years before retiring, but I guess I’ll be done now” and people who would be fine with any of remote/hybrid/in-office but who have moved and moving or commuting back to their current employer isn’t happening. Where I work, we’ve always (before C19) been mainly in-office but with some people 100% remote and with an option for occasional WFH, so we’re used to being flexible. If someone who was a reliable employee wanted to go remote I can’t imagine management saying no. Yes, it’s very empowering to be able to say “please don’t make me retire” For me personally, I was able to successfully argue I had no reason to go back to an office, my entire team is spread across the US. But I also keep my eyes open for other remote options and there’s still a lot out there, even if competition is fierce. I keep wondering this too but don’t voice it because people think it’s an opinion (WFH is bad) rather than just a fact that we’re in a white collar recession. The threat to get another job has zero weight when most places aren’t hiring unless you’re an insanely knowledgeable Accountant or whiz coder. Most of the jobs being created the past six months are food service/hospitality, school jobs, home health aids, etc. I can tell you where I’d go if it happened to me. I take my knowledge and skills to my company’s competitor for around of 50% raise. I might have to go in the office two or three times a week but at least I’d be getting paid for it. and my competitor would be getting some pretty key knowledge that would help advance their competitiveness by about 5 to 10 years in the span of just a few weeks. I don’t think the fully remote positions are much fewer than, say, late 2022, after the pandemic had mostly died down. According to nearly all data sources, work from home shot up between 2019 and 2022, then dropped in 2022 and has more or less been steady since then. But it still WAY higher than it was in 2019 and shows no sign of returning to those levels. I do think there is a concerted effort in business-focused media to enforce the narrative that RTO must happen and working from home must end and that of course every company is going along with that. It’s just not the actual reality, across the board. You’ve got companies that do it, like the one here. But there’s a whole lot of twisted wish-fulfillment-type thinking in business media about this topic. Not so much in my experience though. Still plenty of fully remote jobs, and businesses that are starting up are choosing work from home because it’s a huge cost savings. We just haven’t been in much of an environment for many businesses to start up in. As someone with maybe a paralyzing fear of job searching, thank you for sharing this. It’s like a sunbeam. I just keep thinking, why quit for a job forcing you back if they’re all forcing you back? The trend seems overwhelming. It actually isn’t. The big ego-driven companies with celebrity CEOs are doing it as a flex of their power. The others that are following like lemmings have cargo-cult management. If it was me? I’d grudgingly take a hybrid role, and look to bail as soon as a fully remote role opened up. I loathe open-plan offices, since companies are too cheap to even provide the partial privacy of cubicles anymore, but are still too spendthrift to embrace the reduced costs gained from 100% remote. I despise spending an hour or more commuting each way to sit in a pool of desks with noisy people around me. I get irritated when people see me in person and make judgements about my cane, my limp, and my non-functional, right arm. I seethe at the idea that I need to risk my family’s health due to all of the people who work sick and act as super spreaders of every germ they’ve ever met. I’ve watched lots of people leave the bathroom straight from the stall without washing their hands. They’ll likely do one of couple things: Find a job where the office environment is more pleasant. My current office hub is pretty darn miserable. No available food options, coffee machine is terrible, it’s in a rough part of town, it’s freezing cold all the time, no amenities, and like many people who WFH with a scattered workforce, I wind up on Zoom calls with people all over the US and offshore while sitting in a “hotelling” cube that I can’t personalize or even count on day to day. Find a new job with a pay raise that makes up for the cost of RTO. Find a job that’s more flexible, but not 100% WFH. Find a job with a shorter commute. Patch together freelance, UE and other income sources while holding out for the job they want. Drop out of the workforce to be a SAHP or SAHS (parent/spouse) or pursue a passion project. You owe it to your team to keep them informed so that they can make an educated choice. If they don’t want to show up to the office anyway, that’s their business. Likewise, if they decide to say give one person their key cards and have them sign everyone in each day, that’s also their business. Your job is just to make sure they understand that such behavior can have consequences. When talking to your team, I’d try to emphaise that this mandate isn’t coming from you but rather your bosses and there’s nothing you can do about it. Your employees will still be upset, but you don’t want to get in an argument with them about a policy you can’t change. This is like telling your children it is okay to cheat on a test. It is your business if you try and cheat and game the system. If I knew of employees coffee swiping they would deal with HR and if someone took everyones badges and did it they would most likely be fired. How people don’t see this as a judgment issue I will never understand. Also an FYI, you realize places have cameras right? And companies are also monitoring systems not just card swipes anymore? The time to discuss it was when the CEO mandated 3 days. Instead of skirting the policy OP should have spoken with the CEO with other leaders and maybe asked for 2 days in office or something like that. But honestly how everyone is reacting is probably going to cause a RTO 5 days and less flexibility. My partner has been going back for years but he is allowed to give his team flexibility. There are periods they must be in 4 days (forward facing), but periods that are slower or if someone has an emergency or is sick but can work they stay home (or use their lots of sick leave). But they earned it and showed that when the 3 day mandate came in they did it and they work hard. If I were the CEO I dont know if I could trust people who felt they could just do what they wanted and not follow the policy. If you are loosing clients and having layoffs then there is clearly an issue with working remote and maybe the CEO is trying to help the business/ stop layoffs. Precisely I could be wrong, but I don’t think Parenthesis Guy is suggesting that the LW do a “wink wink nudge nudge” thing with respect to the card swiping. I think he’s saying the LW should stop worrying about how their employees are going to continue to try to get around the policy, and focus on making sure they understand that the policy is the policy and if they don’t follow it, there will be consequences. My general sense of the letter is that the LW is hung up too much on their employees’ feelings, because they themselves don’t like or agree with the policy which makes it more difficult for them to communicate/enforce it. I mean if the policy was “Everyone needs to start using these special pens” and the reason was because it turns out all other pens are somehow rendered explosive in their office then the LW could easily say “I don’t care how special your pink feather pen is to you, you could kill us all if you don’t use these Pilot G-2 07 ones.” LW isn’t going to feel bad about that at all. But telling people they need to come into the office x days a week no matter what just because the CEO says so just… kindof sucks. So Parenthesis Guy is saying to just disconnect and focus on communicating the policy and the fact that there are going to be consequences if they don’t follow it. There’s a lot of wrong assumptions with your message (I’m the LW). I won’t write a big reply why since I’m replying late to these messages so I don’t anyone will really see them, but just wanted to have that clearly written here :) So, you think this manager has no responsibility to actually… manage the staff? Honestly this “see no evil, hear no evil” idea would make Sergeant Schultz of Hogan’s Heroes an ideal. “I see NOTHINK!” There’s a big difference between managing your staff to do their work and managing your staff to come in three days a week when you don’t care. If the CEO makes you in charge of determing who is coming up, then that’s a different story. Eh, it’s the job of a manager to generally enforce the rules. If a manager is that opposed to a rule and hasn’t had success in changing their own manager’s mind on it, it’s time to move on. Idk. Enforcing a rule seems like decidedly her business. It will reflect poorly on her as a people manager, and I don’t think she should risk her professional reputation so they can feel autonomy in their protest (at least not with greater consideration to the risks to her career). To be clear, I don’t agree with the CEO’s decision given what’s been share, but it’s his bad decision to make and hers to communicate and enforce. And enforcement means not turning a blind eye to noncompliance. She can decide how much time and resources she dedicates to this, but she can’t decide (without consequences) to just not do it. This is literally just part of being a manger, unfortunately. Err yes. As a manager I am responsible for enforcing the rules of the company. If I think a rule is really stupid I will challenge it discreetly or suggest alternatives and sometimes they’re adopted. But I don’t get to decide not to do my job which involves ensuring compliance with the rules. If I didn’t want to have to manage people and ensure rules are followed, I wouldn’t be in a management role. He’s their manager. It’s absolutely his business. I’m a GM. If my employee took everyone else’s keycards and swiped for them while I just kept saying “there are consequences,” guess who gets fired first? Me. And I’d deserve it for not managing. I’m curious – and frankly, a little concerned – about the “international calls from 8 am to noon” and the unspecified other reasons why OP’s team might be swapping days. How were those handled in the before times? If those weren’t a big deal pre-COVID, then I think it weakens OP’s case to bring them up – they become excuses, not reasons. If the nature of the work has changed – there are a lot more of these calls because new customers/offshoring/etc., then it is a valid thing to bring up. But it should start w/ the business needs, because that is what CEO is focused on. Since when is having to start at 8AM and work for four hours is a compelling case against working in the office? Other aspects of this workplace (working until 11?! Nonstop meetings?!) are more salient. If you have kids to get to school and a long commute, getting to the office by eight can be tricky to impossible, while simply taking those calls from home presents no difficulty. Perhaps followed by coming into the office for the afternoon, if there is some actual point to this. Having to be in an office by 7:45 to zoom someone across the world means you have to get properly dressed and commute during rush hour. Maybe you also need to get your kids to childcare or pay for early dropoff hours. Being able to take that call from home means you don’t need to get fully dressed or commute during rush hour, and have more time to deal with dependents and get ready before your 8am call. And it doesn’t matter to your coworkers either way, because you’re not talking to them in person regardless. I think the thing here is that it is silly to commute into the office to then close your office door to get on video calls with people who are *not* in your office. If you are coming in to the office to work with coworkers there, then the international call-heavy day isn’t the best day for that. Exactly. My team is in other sites, people in my projects are on other sites and making me go to the office for 4 days just to be in Zoom calls or work by myself just doesn’t make any sense. I have no collaboration on site and I find it frustrating that this is obviously not taken into account. And the changes and improvements in technology for calls etc. in the last 5-6 years are CRAZY – the ease and quality of video calls is so much better, and so many more people can actually do it now, that saying “what happened before C-19” is like saying “let’s just do what we did in the 2010s” when we had completely different systems and tools available. It’s like getting rid of email a few years after it became common. “Well you did your work just fine without it before!” is not really an argument. Or trying to make everyone wear suits and ties again. “You used to wear that 5 days a week!” LW: A good chunk of the local people this is affecting were hired during COVID, when we were fully remote, so there’s that! There’s also a lot of assumption in the comments I’ve noticed where it’s assumed the CEO even understands/knows what we do day-to-day and how this type of stuff affects our work. He does not! He does not care I work until 11PM a good chunk of nights. Every middle manager comes upon their opportunity to fight for their staff or to suck up to the execs. The best ones defend their staff, the ones that give in keep their jobs. Nah. There are middle managers all over the place who can go their entire careers without being given a bridge too far. In a healthy workplace you can be the information conduit between your team and your upper management without having to choose sides like this. If you work exclusively in very toxic workplaces, this might be true. I am a middle manager who will fight for my staff, but at a certain point, you have to recognize that the fight is over; otherwise, you’ll harm your reputation and your career. I’ve repeatedly addressed the merits of flexibility and WFH to senior leadership. Our executive team has decided they are against WFH, and I’ve conveyed to my team that I don’t agree with or like the policies but that we have to abide by them. I could list out a million reasons why work from home is a better option to have available rather than requiring all staff to work in the office 5 days a week, but it doesn’t matter here. It sounds like LW is a senior leader at their company. A senior leader’s job is to champion the direction the CEO wants to take the company. That doesn’t mean you have to agree with it, can’t fight the battle behind the scenes, or that you should gaslight your employees into thinking it was the right decision. But LW needs to be enforcing the CEO’s decisions and making sure staff are compliant with the rules. It sounds like this wasn’t happening before and therefore the CEO continued to take more drastic measures. It sounds like this is settled in your CEO’s mind–he wants people in office, he compromised on a hybrid setup but people kept acting like they worked remotely, so he’s now going to insist on full-time in-office. It sounds like he knows it’s unpopular and doesn’t care. That sucks for anyone on your team who relies on a WFH setup (whether for childcare reasons, a bad commute, medical appointments, or just personal preference). But it shouldn’t be a surprise–not after 3 years of being told to be in office more and more often. The only open question is, what consequences will actually be enforced about it? I’m betting your CEO already knows if he’s willing to fire people over noncompliance. And I bet your team members already know if they’re willing to quit over this. If you can feel out the answers to those questions, that might be useful information for your planning. I’m curious about consequences too. Does the CEO want managers to go through the performance management process that may eventually result in firing? What if a top performer keeps flouting the in-person requirement? “What if a top performer keeps flouting the in-person requirement?“ Then you address that on a case by case basis. Truly top performers can write their own ticket. But few people will get to be top performers (particularly in leadership roles) by isolating themselves at home. Your CEO isn’t seeing the big picture. Or any picture, for that matter. This “my way or the highway” attitude is a sure-fire recipe for already-disgruntled employees (Working until 11 pm and then having to be all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed next morning? Yikes!) to find greener pastures. And for what? To see butts in seats in an office? Just because that’s the way it worked in past, doesn’t make it work today or tomorrow. If you *need* to rehash out the arguments with your staff again, I would focus on triaging. Who really needs an exception and will quit immediately otherwise, and who is just hoping to keep this because it’s nice? For example, you mention some of your team are working out-of-norm hours because of international partners, is it even logistically possible for them to be in their office-seats for those calls? Or would your client/partner calls need to be rescheduled to allow for them to commute as required? Do you lose a top performer who moved farther away and has daycare/school limitations so there’s no way they’ll finish their big project? If you can pick out the points where it’s a real obvious inconvenience for the company to fight with you, you might get the actual exceptions you need (at the expense of the others, of course). Right now you’re fighting too many battles all at once, which just makes your team seem intransigent. Pick the best ones and you have a shot of winning where you really need to. I have a hard time understanding how people who are hired full time on-site (versus remote) have a hard time going in to the office. Like, it’s no surprise, right? Hedonic adaptation. It’s a thing in psychology & economics. You get a new enjoyable thing that you weren’t expecting. After a surprisingly short amount of time, it’s painful to give that thing up, you expect that thing as a given in your life, and you get indignant if you can’t have it. Especially if there doesn’t seem to be a real reason for giving it up. This. I worked five days a week in the office pre-pandemic, though I was definitely considering asking for one WFH day per week even before 2020. Now, being in the office even three days per week is immensely painful. My job can be done 100% from the computer, and my collaboration with my colleagues actually works better via Teams than it does in person for the kind of work that I do. All that is to say that while obviously I did five days a week five years ago, my philosophy has shifted in that time. My approach to work and understanding how my job functions and how it relates to my colleagues underwent a dramatic change five years ago; I don’t think it’s surprising in the slightest that I would want a change from my 2019 status quo. What I’ve learned in the past three years or so is that a lot of people apparently didn’t undergo the same kinds of changes, which is fine but surprising to me. You make a key point, Lisa! The REASON makes a huge difference. Make it meaningful or leave it alone. I mean, it’s been five years since the Covid WFH mandates. That’s a very substantial amount of time for the new normal to have established itself and for people’s lives to have moulded around it. If someone had come along in 2001 and told you you had to go back to Windows 3.1, or taken away your smartphone in 2014 — would you have been indignant? Or would you have completely easily gone back to the way things were five years earlier? I also used to make a third of my current salary, doesn’t mean I’d be happy to go back to it. It sounds like OP’s company has been working remote or hybrid since the pandemic. That’s like 4 years at this point. I’m sure plenty of people were hired during that time frame, for what was at the time a remote or hybrid role, and is now being converted to in-person for the first time. I was hired a couple years before the pandemic and they basically said “you can come in if you really want (to a mostly empty office) but hardly anyone does” and my boss was in another state anyways. We’re still all in different states but we have to commute into our offices. You’re continuing to try to give your employees flexibility, but it seems kinder to let them know that they don’t really have flexibility here. Then they can decide what to do – look for a new job, move closer, whatever. I think people might feel like, okay, another false alarm. They said we’d have to come in, but we don’t really. Yes! It’s great to advocate for your staff, but it’s incredibly important to be honest with them. They should have a realistic understanding of the expectations of their jobs, and make their own choices from there. Yeah, it can actually be more stressful to staff when the expectations aren’t clear. I’m retired now, so no longer have kin in the game, but I know that my last employer told us March 9, 2020 to go home and stay home until further notice. That setup worked fine for years. I worked in software development and support — so face to face contact wasn’t really necessary, but it is good to be in the office occasionally, because the dynamic of an in-person meeting is different than a Zoom call. But if I come into the office and spend eight hours in front of a computer, why am I even coming into the office? IMO, a good solution would be for people to come into the office 1-2 days a week. That should be enough face time to keep things going smoothly, while retaining most of the WFH convenience. I know I was thrilled to not have to spend an hour and a half commuting each day, plus buying or bringing my lunch. Good luck! Reading the letter one of the main things sticking out for me seems to be that from top with CEO through middle/junior management in case of LW there doesn’t seem to be any proper either feedback being supplied up why policy not working or proper notification down that this is what needs to happen. Different departments deciding to pick and choose what to do after the first requests and then not following up with employees is causing this Laissez-faire attitude to it and people feel that the request either doesn’t need followed or doesn’t apply to them. Unfortunately now it’s going to create an impasse, but feels like some more direct management and decision making at beginning could have stopped getting to this stage. Unfortunately for normal employees it’s going to cause the most impact as they’ll need to decide if they want to continue in job with hybrid commitment or find elsewhere. Particularly those that moved away from being local to office. Would be curious about the communication with staff at point of starting being remote whether they were given impression it would be permanent or not. Given what seems to be lack of communication elsewhere, I wouldn’t be surprised if they felt was new conditions going forward. All in all though a complete mess for all involved… I do think it’s a problem for a company to be largely remote when the top leadership doesn’t understand how to run a remote company. I know people here are firmly WFH and don’t see how anyone could think otherwise, but a functional remote company doesn’t just happen. Leadership sets up systems and processes that make it work. It has to be deliberate and intentional to be sustainable. And I say this as someone who works fully remote for an organization that has always been remote. I felt we were well set up, but then we went some major changes to our systems and the organization has been floundering. It feels way less effective because leadership is no longer being deliberate about how to make it work. It’s incredibly frustrating; I’m trying to care, but the lack of oversight means it’s extremely tempting to just take advantage of the fact that no one is paying attention. Obviously people slack off in offices, but it’s a lot easier with remote work unless you have systems. It sounds like a problem that people moved away. That was a gamble they took. Yes, you might lose good people, but they might lose their job. They made that choice when they moved even though WFH was an emergency measure that leadership didn’t fully buy into. Regardless of what way this goes, clarity around expectations and setting up systems that actually work for whatever structure you go with is key. But that’s all on the CEO. This being said, the more I’m thinking about this the more pissed I’d be if I were the CEO. I made my expectations clear, and my middle management undermined me. It sounds like there are plenty of reasons this company isn’t that well run (working till 11pm?), but in a functional company you implement the processes that leadership wants and if there are problems with them you work in an iterative process to refine them. You don’t just be like, “Oh, CEO says this but I don’t like it so I’ll be really lax about it for years.” I think a lot of orgs definitely don’t know how to run a remote company, but I think that’s a bit of a red herring given how many of them don’t know how to run in-person companies either. Communication dysfunction, inability to keep on top of what staff are working on, making sure that people are productive, etc. were all recurring themes in letters published on this site pre-2020. Good companies don’t happen by magic, and bad management can certainly exacerbate the challenges of being remote, but I don’t think “Well, companies are bad at this!” is a reason for a company not to be remote. But if the CEO, the leader of the company, doesn’t want to learn how to run a remote company, that’s his choice? It’s not like a leader just suddenly has the skills and knowledge to run a remote company — those are skills they need to actually develop. It seems like people think there’s no difference, but there’s a huge difference and a steep learning curve. If leadership is like, “I am not interested in learning how to set up a well-run remote company and feel we’re most effective with facetime,” then he gets to make that decision. And if the middle management wants to fight for remote/hybrid, they should be focusing on what his concerns are about remote work and proposing systems that alleviate those concerns. This is also just intuition, but I also think that someone who’s not great at running a company is probably able to make it work a bit better in person than remotely, partly probably due to their comfort with the systems they came up in. Frankly there are other details in that make me think this isn’t a very well run company, there are clearly huge communication issues, and honestly hybrid is probably somewhat contributing to that. But the super long work days alone are a flashing red flag. He absolutely gets to make that decision, but that’s not what your top-level comment was about so I didn’t think it was necessary to address that. “But some companies are dysfunctional in any format” also really didn’t address the meat of what I was saying either, though. I actually really am not sure what your response had to do with my comment. My point is that running a company remotely requires specific skills and decisions, which is a reality that I rarely see commenters take into consideration when advocating for remote work. I think we’re just talking past each other, so I’ll leave it there. Personally, this long drawn out ambiguity and drama would drive me bonkers regardless of topic. Whatever the CEO chooses, and however the employees choose to react, there will be consequences. So just make the decision and see what the consequences are and then deal with them and move on. Maybe everyone quits. Maybe they don’t. Only one way to find out! I’m a manager, and I HATE hybrid. As far as I am concerned, it’s the worst of both worlds. (For context, I worked all-remote for most of the pandemic, then hybrid, then all-in-person, and now back to hybrid). All remote, people were in “remote mode” and stuff got done because that was the only way! Moreover, as a manager, my talent pool went wayyyy up because I could hire from anywhere across the country. All in-person, okay, it was largely back to the way things were pre-pandemic. Same old, same old. Hybrid? Setting aside the actual work schedule/ethic since that varies by employee and office culture, the system just isn’t set up to accommodate remote work as well as it was when we were all remote. Computer’s acting up? IT will tell you to bring it in on your next in-office day, and you’re fiddling until then. Don’t have a deep pool of people with the specialized skill set you need in the local area? Too bad, you can’t hire from further away because you can’t reasonably ask them to commute a four-hour flight 4 days a week. I work 100% remotely now and have for about a decade, but I’ve been working hybrid since the mid90s. It’s not as cut and dried as you portray, at least not in a functional company. Many, many companies have had successful hybrid environments for decades. I work 100% remotely for medical reasons and I now work at a company that’s 100% remote, but when I was physically capable, I found hybrid was often the best option (for me, 1-2 days onsite, 3-4 remote is perfect). Some of it depends on the specific tasks – quiet focused time can be difficult in a cube farm or open office, for example. Research showed that 80% of CEOs regretted forcing return to office policies. The ones that did it well actually worked with employees to make it manageable. The ones that regretted it used top-down ultimatums and found themselves faced with mass resignations. As other people have pointed out, the ones that have in-demand skills will be the first to go. The real question is, what is productivity like? If it has stayed stable or increased since WFH started, then forcing RTO with no corresponding increase in wages or benefits is going to be perceived as purely ego-driven and punitive and staff who can find other jobs will flee. This is exactly what commenters are missing. The issue about the pro and con of RTO vs hybrid vs WFH. The issue is the lack of clarity and facts about RTO in general and for this LW’s organization. Everyone has *opinions* about the so called mandate. There is no clear direction from the CEO who apparently is him/herself working from wishes and wants vs. facts and apparently little guidance on communicating the mandate and consequences for ignoring it. Get that, LW, and since you have skin in this game, get data and plan to mitigate impacts. Demand clarity, whichever way it goes. (Northwestern Mutual has entered the chat) Say what? Record earnings when they were completely WFH but still demanding RTO. Senior VP had some snarky comment about how people would have to do laundry on weekends instead of during workday. Always fascinating to wonder what research people are referring to when they say “research shows”! Enter “80% of CEOs regretted forcing return to office policies” in your preferred search engine and you’ll get a CNBC article of the same name from 2023, which links to the research within the body of the article. Amen. Seems like at the very least, the company should be getting what they “asked for”. Go to the office for your 8-5, take your actual lunchbreak, then go home. Don’t work until 11 pm, take your sick days and personal days, carve back some of that time creep that remote work allowed. And support your staff in this too. 100% this. Leadership doesn’t get to force RTO because “that’s the way it used to be” while also expecting the early morning or late-night work. I also work in a large international organization. Fortunately, our current CEO is not rigid in the ways described here. Unfortunately, I could see that changing depending on how US federal remote work policies change under Trump, because the US government is a major funder of our work. One thing I detect in this letter and in other international organizations with rigid in-office work requirements is an expectation of flexibility from staff without concomitant flexibility offered by the organization. Many US-based staff in international orgs start their work days between 6-8a to be available for calls with colleagues in other offices. Would this CEO agree to a policy where no US staf take calls before 9a Tues-Thursday? I think it’s very unlikely as that would not be in the interest of the organization. I agree with Alison on all these points! It’s the CEO’s call, but if they don’t enforce it, few are going to do it and those who do will be annoyed that so many others don’t. I’m in an office that is a long commute for me, where they literally don’t have enough desks or seats for everyone, and many were working remote before the pandemic (I started remote during the pandemic shutdown.) They also have way too few conference rooms and phone booths so people are shouting over one another on calls at the crowded desks. Yet every year or so they make some announcement that they want people to return to office, unless they were hired remote, or they live far away, or their manager allows them to stay remote, or they are feeling sick but not too sick to work… There are so many exceptions that it’s just annoying. I basically go to the office when I have rare meetings with someone who is in the office, otherwise I work at home because it makes more sense and I get more done. I wonder about the discussion on RTO: if a job can be 100% remote, what prevents it from being offshored or downgraded in pay? Why should I pay Manhattan rates if I can hire someone in Wyoming for less? While talent may be hard to find and could leave, the option of going into the office might become a key advantage for employees in the future. Additionally, those who dismiss the need for mentoring often overlook that layoffs can force someone to move companies. Not knowing who handles tasks in accounting highlights the benefits of being in the office. Many who excel at WFH have already gained momentum and can rely less on in-office benefits. Well, more people live on the island of Manhattan than in the entire state of Wyoming, so while in theory that works there’s a reason people pay NY rates. All kinds of hypotheticals work but not every notion pans out. No one’s dismissing the need for mentoring, but lots of people are saying it needs to be deliberate and structured, rather than haphazard and on the fly. If you don’t know who handles the tasks in accounting, that’s an issue of bad onboarding, absent process documents, and/or lack of documentation in staff manuals. It’s not because you weren’t sitting in an office. I have an ongoing job manual that I keep up to date and it always includes page detailing colleagues on other teams that I interact with, for what purpose, and how often so that when I eventually move on, the person after me knows exactly who to talk to and about what. It doesn’t have to be some unknowable mystery. Something that comes screaming through this letter is that the LW doesn’t want to RTO him/herself. I’d be shocked if their employees haven’t picked up on that and figured “Hey! LW is one of us! They probably won’t push back if we push the RTO policy to the limit. After all, they don’t like coming in, either”. Time to change that. As mentioned upthread, the CEO gets to make this call and it’s the LW’s job to enforce the new RTO mandate. It’s time for LW to stop ALL commiserating with their reports on this subject, and figure out how to implement that which the CEO has commanded from on high. When people know that their manager doesn’t like a policy, they feel more emboldened to push the boundaries of that policy. I’d also suggest thinking through ahead of time what constitutes an acceptable WFH day when it’s Tuesday – Thursday, and what does not, and talk that through with your team. Be completely frank – something like: “WFH on designated office days is allowed occasionally for life’s little emergencies like letting in a repairman or staying home when you feel a little under the weather. However, please know that WFH mid-week should be the unusual exception, not something you’re doing with any regularity. That vast majority of the time, I expect to see you in-office every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday unless you’re taking PTO”. Funny enough, LW here, I wasn’t the problem. My boss and I supervise everyone. Pre recent layoffs, it was 3 of us (another director). The other director unfortunately got let go and he absorbed her people (like +3). So he directly supervises the majority of people. HIS people were the ones not following the mandate the most at first. So the less he pushed his people, when he’s ABOVE me, the more I got confused how enforceable should I even be. Funny how that works typing that out now! Because also, outside my boss, despite me making my feelings known on the mandate, I follow it the most :) I’d often be alone in the office til EOD. I read an article about a recent return to the office mandate (I don’t remember if it was Amazon or not), and the comments the employees left on the Slack announcement. Many of the featured comments in this particular article were about not being able to come into the office due to not having child care and WFH making child care easier. Traditionally, aside from the pandemic and the random sick day, you aren’t supposed to have kids at home when you WFH full-time(I learned that here on AAM). And honestly, I’m not surprised we are seeing more strict in-office mandates. Exactly. I learned about the pre-pandemic childcare requirement here as well. If the LW’s workplace is representative of other companies, people are just flouting the in office days and doing what they like. I’m not surprised about the strict in office mandates, either. Like kids in a class, the people who abused the system are making the system worse for those who have been following the rules diligently. A lot of people are still stuck between a rock and a hard place. It’s still very difficult to find affordable childcare in many areas, and in some areas, consistent childcare just isn’t available for very young children. Of course, remote workers should have childcare in place so they can focus on their jobs, but the reality is that that just isn’t an option for everyone. So those folks are stuck in the sense that they can’t afford/access childcare but they still need their jobs. When my husband’s office declared a 2-day-per-week in-office hybrid, he was being slack about attending it. I told him to PLEASE straighten up and follow the mandate, because if people didn’t take it seriously, the CEO was going to get sick of the whole thing and make them 40 hours a week in person. It seems to have worked, people seem to be respecting it, and they’ve remained hybrid. There’s a huge potential for such a policy to be enforced on people that the CEO or some senior manager doesn’t like, and unenforced for the managerial favorites. I think the CEO should be forced to give unequivocal guidelines on how to deal with someone who doesn’t come in often enough, even if this person is totally beloved by all. A blanket policy that doesn’t acknowledge how stressful it is to do 10 PM or 3 AM or even 6 AM calls, and then also have to come into the office just like everyone else for a full day’s work, is wrong, imo. If I have such a call, I consider that a good reason to work from home that day (or the following). If the CEO doesn’t think so, they need to specifically address that point. I read on a forum recently from a person who stated categorically that they cannot return to the office because they will be killed while driving in traffic. That underlined for me one of the reasons I prefer my hybrid schedule. Being at home so much was reducing my resiliency for dealing with the world outside. Just chiming in for those of us who are not devoted to 100% WFH. We’re out here, and we’d love to go for lunch sometime. I work in mental health (I’m a psychiatric NP) and I see people— not a ton, but I’ve seen several— for whom WFH has drastically worsened their issues. “I can’t go back to the office because I’ll be too anxious” is an example. Prior to Covid, there were people who were forced to address their anxiety and learn to function, because they had no other options. Now, there is this option to retreat and hide, and for some people, it is devastating to their functioning. Your word “resiliency” is a succinct way of describing this. Yeah, I like my hybrid a ton. Quite similarly much of my social life (with two young kids) is meeting people for lunch on office days, coworkers or not because I work in Midtown. Yeah, hybrid once a week is perfect for me. I was 100 remote for about 18 months, went sporadically to the office when it was allowed again and have been going regularly for the past 2 years. I’m more productive at home but I enjoy seeing my coworkers. I find that really interesting, though I have the opposite experience. Working from home has increased my resilience to the everyday problems that life throws my way. Because my social battery isn’t drained from being in the office all day and my physical energy isn’t drained from commuting, I have more energy and emotional resources to deal with life. Do people not leave their homes to go places other than work? I truly don’t mean this to be snarky. It’s just so far outside my own experience. I WFH unless I’m doing work travel, but I go to activism-related meetings and protests, I go to the crafts studio where I’m a member, I go running, I volunteer at a food pantry, I go to ethnoreligious events, I go to medical appointments, I go to cafes and restaurants and friends’ homes. I’ve found that not having to deal with a commute and an office helps me deal better with the rest of life like HungryLawyer does, but that one will definitely vary from person to person. If my body hadn’t started throwing pain riots when I went to the office (multiple different reasons/sources), I’d still be willing to go, but I will say that commuting in rush-hour traffic regularly made my overall driving worse until after I stopped having to do it XD How do you separate that from the trauma of living through a global pandemic and being let down by our governments and society? There’s a lot less social trust than there used to be and it’s not due to WFH. I’m not understanding what’s not going great about this process, other than that it’s maybe too slow. Senior management has decided they want to employ a team of people who are willing to work from the office, and currently the company is shaking out who is willing to do that and who is going to leave. Having been involved in a return-to-work process, I’m pretty confident this is exactly what the CEO expected. OP doesn’t like what’s happening. That’s fair. But it’s going about how the company likely expected. A major issue we are facing in my workplace is the cost of maintaining a physical workplace when everyone is on a hybrid work schedule and our office is only significantly occupied 2 days per week. I totally understand why leadership is having trouble figuring out how to balance WFH while also justifying the half million a year our leased space costs. Especially as we are absorbing budget cuts due to changes in our core funding. I see a lot of scorn for CEOs/leadership and their inflexibility, some of which is probably well deserved, but think larger corporations and companies located in high COLAs are probably really struggling with this right now. In many cases it may not be really possible to cut down on space to allow for hybrid work and some cost savings due to the way the building is configured or where it is. And IME, telling people with offices that they work in a couple of days per week that their offices are going away because they aren’t used enough causes the opposite complaint. I don’t know what the right answer is here – I hope hybrid is here to stay and that we and other groups can figure out how to keep enough space to have the opportunity for regular in person meetings (I am so tired of Zoom although it’s so great to have it in the toolbox) while permitting a decent amount of WFH flexibility. Excellent points! It will be interesting to see how these things play out. I’ve seen some places say you have an allocated desk if you’re in 4 days or more, otherwise it’s hotdesking. There may be some reluctance at first but you can’t have it both ways and really, hot desking is fine for most people/roles, as long as you have a locker or storage to keep some things at the office This feels like a version of the sunk cost fallacy. You have a lease, so you’re going to be paying half a million a year whether or not you use the space, so management feels like they have to get their money’s worth, by having people in the office. But the relevant number isn’t that half a million/year: it’s that half a million, minus however much or little you’re spending specifically because people are working from home. An empty office doesn’t cost you more than it would if someone was sitting in there, using a computer or talking on the phone. There may be other reasons for wanting Fergus in the office, depending on the specifics of your work. If so, focus there: you can’t do hands-on lab work remotely, and that would be true even if the lab space was free. In my experience the problem with the leadership mandates is that they fail to clearly communicate what they expect the results to be. They need to provide a general goal that managers can filter and specify for their team’s roles, and that shows leadership understand how business gets done. Otherwise it’s cute that they say they want more collaboration … when teams are geographically dispersed anyhow. Yes, I agree–I think transparency on both sides is really important here. To the team, as Alison says, you can say, “Look, I know you don’t like it, but this decision has come down from the CEO and this is going to be the reality of working here. It is up to you to decide if you are willing to do that.” Likewise, I think it’s also worth telling the CEO, “We will lose people if we stick to this mandate. Are you comfortable with that?” I think WFH is mostly a huge “It Depends.” As someone in Tech: all of my teams are dispersed into multiple geographies. A mandate would mean that I drive to the office to have virtual calls all day long (on worse internet than I have at my home office). Not all teams are co-located or tied to the region. OTOH, my young-adult kids graduated during COVID and have worked mostly remote — office work would benefit from office-based career seasoning. My company has committed to never forcing us back full time, aside from occasional (like monthly) events. We can go in if we want, and I choose to because I really do work better from the office – I get distracted at home with my dog and so on. But anyway, the cat is out of the bag in this situation, and it’s technically the CEO’s call. There are not ZERO benefits to being in the office before people go there, it’s the mandate that’s cruel. Sorry you’re in this. It’s a boulder that’s all the way down the hill. I find this very frustrating as a remote employee. We are all able to WFH as much as we want and come into the office whenever is convenient. In the summer, I am there at least once every two weeks if not more. In the winter with weather and travel, probably more like once a month. However, some of the higher ups and HR are always saying they would love to see more people in the office for no other reason than “Vibes! Collaboration!”. We have employees who live in different time zones and an office in the UK at this point. I work with clients all over the globe and frequently spend most of my day on Teams calls. I am very lucky that I have an entirely separate office at my house (my house was built to contain a dentist office in the 60s) so it truly feels like I am “going to work” when I go there in the morning. In this situation, I think the manager has to be very clear about the mandate and that they will need to enforce it and let people make their decisions. For us the handbook states that WFH could be changed for anyone who lives less than two hours from the office. Are there any parameters to this mandate? Have they set any guidelines? It seems to me the real issue here is that there are no consequences for not coming into the office. My business unit it supposed to be in the office 5 days a week now, but I come in and it’s pretty clear that more than 50% of the people on my floor are not coming in. But you know what? The managers are not allowed to do anything about it. No consequences, no change. The OP’s CEO needs to state what the consequences are and enforce them, otherwise the managers have no power to enforce return to office. The issue isn’t trying to get the CEO to back down on return to office, the issue is to force the CEO to decide how failure to return to the office will be enforced. I’m starting to get a little worn out on the whole return to office debate. CEOs get to dictate what they want. In my case, a condition of my job is to come into the office everyday. I would prefer hybrid, but it’s not really an option. I like my job, I like the money I make, and if it requires being in the office 5 days a week, that’s the deal. (We aren’t unionized, so we lack negotiating power.) My company went hybrid at some point after lockdowns happened (I am not sure on timing as I came in during 2022). Sadly many people abused the hybrid format. If the bosses weren’t in they didn’t come in. Even if you were required to be in. I was hired in during the fall of 2022. And anytime my boss wasn’t in (he travels from office to office) few people were in. My department wasn’t alone in this. It was bad esp in the beginning bc there were days as someone brand new in the role where I was totally alone in the office. Yes I could reach everyone via teams, but honestly it felt a bit unfair I was the only one to abide by the rules. Not gonna lie, I see why lots of placing are enforcing this. If you have brick and mortar place that you “report” to I think the majority of people should prepare themselves to go back in. As much as it stinks. Honestly, it doesn’t sound like the problem is RTO, but rather being overworked and understaffed with poor workplace culture and then RTO on top of that. Going from the details in the letter, RTO is a late-landing straw, not the whole camel-load. In your position, LW, I’d work to rule while job searching. It’s tough out there sadly (LW here). “junior employees who are missing out on the learning by osmosis that happens when they share space with more experienced employees” I keep seeing this offered as a reason for RTO but I think it’s mostly BS. Or at least it’s heavily outweighed by the benefits of WFH for most professional office roles. When I was a “junior employee” long before COVID I don’t remember management caring about anything except me getting my work done and keeping the more senior employees happy. Oh gosh, it’s not at all! I have a new hobby where I go to classes 1-2 days per week. I learn so much from listening to and observing the people who have done it for 25 years even though they are often just talking about ways to improve their excellent work. You could literally never think of all the little things that make a good worker an expert. A hobby where you go to classes not the same as a job. The junior people in my team love being remote and all I got out of being in-office during the first half of my career was dealing with toxicity and being reminded constantly that I was a low-level peon. I can count the senior managers who took an interest in my growth on two fingers. I have opportunity to WFH some and I enjoy those days. I CAN be more productive and generally hold a few tasks that are more focus-intensive for those days. Having said that, the mandate is the mandate. There will likely be consequences when workers decide they want something different than in-office all the time. What I’d hope for as middle management is two things. First I think it would be helpful for the CEO to give a clear “why” for the return to office mandate. Are we more productive? Are we losing out on business because we can’t collaborate as easily? It can’t just be that Amazon is doing it. That doesn’t hold as much water with the workforce as something directly related to YOUR business. Second, he needs to be willing to empower managers to enforce this. If there isn’t a consequence, as there hasn’t been to this point, no one is going to take this seriously. The fact that the present return to office has been so sloppy and willy-nilly isn’t helping this either. CEO can dictate this. CEO also has to realize he may get to find out when he f*cks around. With RTO, I always want to ask is the CEO there full time as well? I guarantee they want butts in seats when they cruise through occasionally but mostly work wherever and whenever they want. This smacks as unfair to employees who have been productive at home. But also I know life isn’t fair and CEO’s always get the lions share. COVID changed expectations about remote work/telework, but before we were all sent home it was understood that telework was a privilege to be earned, not a right. I have argued that this is what we need to return to. If your people are getting their work done from home, and aren’t relying on people who are in to do certain parts of their jobs, they should be eligible to telework. But if your team is like mine, your high performers will still perform at home, the slackers will be slackers no matter where they are, but at least if they are in you can keep an eye on. I never had anyone telework full time, but there were a couple that did three days a week at home because they were very productive there. Again, I think I’d argue to the CEO for telework for those who earn it. Yeah. At my work we have one of those people who claim they can totally work fully remote…but at least once per day they are asking someone to find something for them in the office. They don’t want to admit it…but they need to come in. I work fully remote and it’s a big plus for why I continue to work at my current job, but I also think people have gotten very weird about WFH vs. in office. Yes, not commuting is great! I love the flexibility to work out in the morning and walk my dog, etc. However, on days that I do go into an office, it’s also fine. It’s nice to talk to other people and leave my apartment. It’s nice to have a routine outside of spending 98% of my time in the apartment. And if being 100% remote is your only priority, then you need to have a job that permits that. It doesn’t really matter (IMO) if the job can be done remotely if the CEO is saying they want people in office. Especially when people are flagrantly disregarding the hybrid RTO because they just don’t feel like being in-office! There are arguments above of “okay fine, the CEO gets to make that call and let the chips fall where they may if it’s the bad decision it seems to be”, and that’s LEGALLY true, but let’s put on our human hats here for a second and realize that they pushback is because these are HUMANS we are talking about, their livelihoods are hanging in the balance, and we all know that the workers of a company know how it runs much better than the CEO ever does and we have more than ample examples of examples screaming “STOP! That’s going to sink us all” while the CEO steered the ship right into the iceberg and drowned everyone. My point here is that the livelihoods of many people shouldn’t depend on the bad judgement of one mediocre person at the top who can’t manage effectively. A company that listens to its employees will be successful, not one that blindly follows its CEO. And now I open it up to all the mediocre bosses to comment and tell me how I’m wrong and they are right…. Livelihoods in the balance? Isn’t that rather dramatic? If someone doesn’t like the RTO mandate, they can go find a job elsewhere. That’s their choice. It’s also the CEO’s choice to require everyone in the office 5 days a week. I will say, it is WILD to see how much the opinion on WFH has changed among this site’s commentariat. I was laid off from a job of 13.5 years at the start of the pandemic. After being out of work for 4 months, I got a fully remote job for 8 months (laid off due to expected business increase not happening). I’ve been in office at current job for almost 4 years. Current company owners loathe WFH. Whatever. There are reasons I like being in the office, although I did the same job from home for 8 months during the pandemic. I’m not sure why everyone thinks they’re entitled to WFH after the pandemic ended. Some companies like it and downsized their buildings. But the absolute freaking out and losing it some people display due to RTO mandates? Headscratcher for sure. “we all know that the workers of a company know how it runs much better than the CEO ever does“ Sounds like you’re looking for an anti-work blog, not a career advice blog, Jan. Please rein in the snark. ??? No one is in danger of drowning here. I feel like you’re trying to imply that the LW or the others in the company have a *moral* duty to… do what exactly? Stage a mutiny and wrest control of the company away from the CEO? Over a RTO policy? The policy isn’t illegal, immoral, or dangerous. The absolute worst thing that could happen is that a critical number of employees leave and the company closes/dissolves. Except that’s not particularly likely to happen unless there are other reasons why the company is teetering. The LW referring to some abysmal working conditions might point to this, but if the WFH policy is literally the only thing that’s keeping this company from collapsing… that’s not exactly a good argument for trying to defeat the RTO mandate since that’s basically saying “Don’t rip the band aid off otherwise people might realize they’re hemorrhaging from where I keep stabbing them in their arteries!” What’s *most* likely to happen if the CEO pushes all this through is that a lot of employees will enjoy their jobs less. Some/many? of those will start looking for other jobs and will leave. They’ll be replaced – possibly with less competent/productive people but also possibly with just as competent/productive people who prefer working in an office. I’m curious about the people you say are too comfortable and abusing the system. Have they been spoken to about expectations at all? I work for a company that is largely in-office, but our department is more flexible than most. We had one guy who I think was abusing the system. He would often leave early. When I first started, I was taken aback when he told me that he doesn’t really ever use PTO, even though he goes on vacations and visits family in another state. He said that over the holidays he didn’t take any PTO because he “monitored his emails” while visiting out of town family. So basically the guy glanced at his phone every so often while hanging out with family/going on outings during the workday and put 8 hours of working time. Eventually his boss told him that if he was going out of town, he had to use PTO, and that he was expected to be in the office for 8 hours on his in-office days (remote work wasn’t fully revoked, but it had a lot more restrictions). He eventually left for a fully remote position. I hope he likes his new job better, but this is the type of person who spoils flexible work/hybrid work for the rest of us. This comment just summarized exactly why WFH is going away. As a manager, this is exactly what happens. It simply does. I have changed how I think about this in the past year or so. Previously I was vehemently opposed returning to the office full time, and while I still would prefer hybrid, working in the office full time isn’t a dealbreaker anymore. However, I came to my current employer during lockdown and was remote for the first 18 months. We now work 2-3 days in and the rest from home. If THIS employer tried to tell me to come back in full time, I would quit. There is no way I would ever go into the office full time here. But it wouldn’t be a dealbreaker in a new job, if I knew that was the deal going into it. I wonder how much of this is “I won’t go back to working full time in person” vs. “I won’t work THIS JOB full time in person when I have been doing fine hybrid/remote.” It’s a fair question. Part of the reason I don’t think my job should be fully in office is because I have a team across the US, so I would still be in virtual meetings all day. But the exact same job where everybody comes into the same office would be perfectly fine. I think this is actually a good point. I remember the phrase “a little change hurts a lot, and a lot of change doesn’t hurt that much more.” If I have to radically re-orient myself in my current job, I might as well look around and see if I can do better. They’ve lost the advantage of “devil you know / inertia.” Maybe I won’t find another job that’s fully remote either but I might well discover while I’m looking that I can get more money or a project that seems more exciting that the thing I’ve been working on for the last three years, and now have to keep working on from an office. I think for me it’s a little of both. I don’t want to do this job full time in person because I did it successfully fully remote. But knowing that my job is 100% computer based, I would also be annoyed to have another 100% computer based job in the future that required me to come in. It’s about the nature of the work for me, so I can’t see myself being fine doing hybrid or full-time in office ever again unless the nature of the work demanded that. Just for once during these discussions on RTO, I would love to see proof of the following: 1) everyone going to the office and just sitting on Zoom, not talking to any of their team members 2) CEOs continuing to work from their beach houses instead of in the office 3) CEOs not using any sort of reasoning for demanding return to office (because they’re all just doing it off of vibes, I guess?) A lot of AAM commenters just throw these things out but I’d love to know widespread these phenomena are. Or is everyone taking the same dozen examples and insisting that every RTO policy is like that? #3 certainly happens – the reason will be a vague “collaboration” or talk about the energy of the office and all the great brainstorming that will occur. The Amazon RTO was not based on data at all, just on “vibes” and “gut feelings”. There have been articles written about it. Google is your friend. Despite your Mr. Burns stereotype, CEOs are generally not making arbitrary decisions based on no data whatsoever. As to “it happens,” well, it’s a big universe, and undoubtedly you can find exceptions. But the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data”; they’re certainly not doing at *as a class*, at scale. #1 was the case in my company and I had to push for in-person meetings. If we’re going to be in the office, it doesn’t make sense to be Zooming, and if we’re worried about making each other sick, we shouldn’t be in the office. What kind of proof can we offer? We can’t share internal communications or photos of our offices. We can only share anecdotes about what we’ve experienced. #1 is me twice a week. Any meetings are virtual & my most substantive (live) interaction with a team member is at the end of the day when our admin says goodbye to me on their way out. As the LW here, I can tell you #1 super happens for our situation. My team is quite friendly, but they’re often stuck in meetings. Our CEO comes in 50% of the time himself, and sits on his phone in his office. If he’s not busy on his phone, he’s giving random projects that impede the paying client work. I’m the office admin/receptionist at a company that’s just done this and I’m of two minds. On one hand, I was constantly being made to pick up the slack for people abusing the hybrid system. People would flake out of coming into the office and opt to work from home at the last minute and then I’d be stuck redirecting all of their mail/onboarding their new hires/supervising complicated technical installations by third party contractors in their area of the building. On the other hand, we downsized to a smaller office during the pandemic and the new space can’t comfortably accommodate everyone at one time. The mandatory return to three days a week (with basically everyone choosing to come in Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) has been a logistical nightmare for me. Everyone’s already cranky about having to come in and I’m the closest punching bag. I literally feel sick about going into the office every morning and I don’t even get the benefit of two WFH days. Sorry, hit “Submit” too quickly. My point is that I think the issue with a lot of return-to-office policies is that they’re not made in consultation with the people most affected (i.e. low-level pink collar office grunts like me) and therefore are often done in a way that causes maximum inconvenience to everyone involved. This sucks and I’m sorry. I hope you’re given a chance to express everything you’ve experienced/observed to someone who can help make a change. This. You have grounds to push back on this, and if you’re coming to work feeling sick every day because of it, I think it’s probably a good idea that you do because you can’t continue like this. Do we work for the same company because this sounds startlingly similar. I’m sorry you’re in the same boat as me :( I work for a very large and bureaucratic organization (multiple business units & subsidiaries, dozens of folks that could be called “upper management”) that mandated a 3 day in the office week back when RTO was just a vague concept. My office/subsidiary resisted a long time, our CEO is very pro remote work, plus our work teams are split among 4 time zones so everything is happening on Teams no matter where your desk sits. Higher management began enforcing RTO across all offices in early 2023, so while we don’t like it, we’ve had to learn how to live with it and work around it. I have mandated that my team’s in office days are Tues-Thurs with the agreement that anyone can swap days if they need to, as long as I’m informed. I also know things may change for special circumstances. The overall company only tracks swipes in to the building. I figure, as long as our group average for days swiped in stays around 3 days per week, we should remain under the radar. This also means I can split days (half day in the office, half day at home) without anyone raising concerns. If there are big meetings or events in the office, I notify everyone I advance and strongly encourage attendance that day. Sometimes it sucks to be the bad guy when I don’t want to be there either, but if we can work within the rules and fly under the radar, while also getting our work done, then I think I’m meeting everyone’s expectations. at my job, the people who moved away from our city during the pandemic are allowed to stay remote but everyone who still lives here has to go in three times a week. if you don’t, you might get reprimanded by your manager, who works fully remote and you have never met in person. all of it is clearly just to justify their expensive office. make it make sense. Same at my employer. The division I am in has been more flexible and looks the other way (for now), but the inconsistencies are unfair to those stuck going in while their colleagues who moved get to remain remote and connect with those in-office via Teams. I’m one of the lucky ones who moved away. Honestly, if WFH were as great for the company and productivity as online communities claim it would be the new normal. Personal observation – only 10 to 15% of the workforce is professional and self-motivated enough to WFH, the rest just aren’t. And that’s okay. Given this particular situation, where the employees blew off a good compromise and are now looking at 5 days a week, my guess is that is will be years until they try WFH again, and are prepared to lose workers over it. Preach! Interesting, I’d say only 10-15% of professional class workers AREN’T cut out for remote work in my experience. Most of us have stakeholders, partners, coworkers, etc. who live in other places so we’re already “remote” even when we’re in the office. And all it takes to “try” remote work again is a manager or two deciding that they’re going to allow it or upper management deciding that it’s not worth enforcing anymore. Or recruitment/retention problems. But it IS the new normal for many jobs and workplaces. This trend started many years before Covid, the pandemic only accelerated it and made some work places that were unprepared or for whom it was unsuitable try do do it because there was no choice except shutting down altogether. Perhaps point out that staff won’t be working back to 11pm and putting in the extra. Who’s going to be able to work until 11pm say arrive home at 12.30am to be up and leaving by 7.30am to commute back in AND be productive! Discussions about to WFH or to not WFH are like discussions around American politics right now. Neither side is willing to even admit a tiny little bit that the other side might have good points, and both sides think the other side is idiotic/uneducated/too old/dangerous. I’m honestly tired of hearing about any of it, and I don’t understand how after five years of this we still have so much to say about it. It’s not like there’s been any massive revelations or breakthroughs. Anyway, OP, your CEO gets to make whatever rules he wants to, it’s why he’s the CEO. You would need to organize a big enough group with enough capital and craft a cohesive proposition as to how WFH would benefit him and the company to push back on his mandates, and even then you’ve got a 50/50 chance. If you can pull it off, great. If not though, you’ve got to first decide if this is a place you want to stay at. If that answer is still yes, then you have to hold your people accountable to the rules of the establishment whether you empathize with them or not. This is a great analogy “Neither side is willing to even admit a tiny little bit that the other side might have good points, and both sides think the other side is idiotic/uneducated/too old/dangerous.” This … is an unfortunate summary of the whole debate. Doesn’t fix anything, but here we are. I don’t think anyone on the “WFH side” refuses to acknowledge that there can be benefits to in person work. I think it’s the mandatory and pointless nature that people have a problem with. I work remotely 5 days a week but am forced to do so at an office 3 days a week for some reason. If I needed to be in person occasionally for good reason I’d be fine with that. I think most of us would be. Whereas the “RTO side” seems to base their entire position on maybe one potentially legit reason (collaboration) and the rest is just vibes and “well some people can’t WFH at all due to their nature of their job and you did it before so suck it up!” Even “collaboration” is vibes like 90% of the time it’s used. I think part of the issue here is that both sides are assuming what the other side thinks WFH/Remote work is a disability justice issue. Work already leans far far far towards arbitrary and nonsensical business “needs” at the expense of employee quality of life. We don’t need to encourage it by letting these RTO mandates be implemented without challenging them, or pretending that people who are advocating for the right for WFH are somehow entitled, elitist, lazy, antisocial, etc. I am multiply-disabled. If I had to work in an office, I wouldn’t be able to work. Because I get to work from home, I’m able to support myself, my husband and my son on my income alone. Commuting, not being in control of my work environment, spending energy on social interactions in office, are just some of the things that make working in the office impossible for me to maintain long term. Who is stopping people who want to work in the office from working in the office? No one. But plenty of companies are using RTO mandates to get rid of staff, to enforce archaic standards, to encourage unhealthy and unproductive management styles, etc. etc. etc. Nothing good for the working class comes from these mandates. I think that part of the issue is that WFH people are used to people demeaning our work and treating it as though it isn’t “real” work. The “essential” terminology during the pandemic exacerbated that (my answering a crisis hotline from home and helping homeless DV survivors apply for benefits/obtain housing and food/etc from home was not “essential to remain in person” but I would argue that it was pretty essential in that it’s work that needed to be done, and there was in fact heightened need for it during the pandemic). I’m used to having to defend my work as work, the dignity of my labor. I try to not dig in with blanket statements in the way you’re describing. Not all work is the same. Everyone should have good (safe, well-paid) working conditions, but that will mean different things in different jobs. But I do feel the need to assert the value of my own work in no uncertain terms, because it’s pretty common for anti-WFH people to demean it. Yeah, just like the people who call remote workers “entitled” because we chose careers that don’t require in-person hands on. Annoying. After 2020 – 2021 being WFH (with some, like me, going in about 1x a week to do things) our office went back with a mandated 3-2 hybrid schedule (3 in office) in January 2022 (with a three-month advance warning). There are very formal and strict rules around it which can seem unfair or antiquated on the individual level but work across the institution to make things fair. Our division has a rule that everyone is in the office on Mondays which is the day for internal meetings and this works really well for us. As someone in my industry for more than 20 years, this seems to be a good balance between work/life and the subtle benefits of in-office work, especially for new and new-to-the-industry employees. It’s not perfect, but as a manager I appreciate that the rules are strict – I can pretty easily point to them if anyone abuses the schedule. This is less about what’s “right” or “wrong” or how things “should” be but more about what IS. Then everyone can decide if they want to remain on the job or leave. Because you fill the role you do, you are committed to doing what is best for the company since the company is who pays you. I say all this as a junior employee myself who only WFH one day a week and sits in traffic twice a day. Since everyone on your team is an adult, they need to make adult, treat them as such. I feel like so much of the insistence on returning to office can be attributed to companies wanting to “get their money’s worth” on commercial leases. We had an office that, prior to COVID, most staff worked at home at least part-time, with many others only coming in for meetings. After COVID, no one returned to the office. When our execs realized that staff did not have a desire to return, and productivity had not changed, they quickly found another company to sublet our office space. It was around that time that I saw some numbers for how much we had been paying for the office. I was blown away! We were able to take the funds that had previously gone towards the lease and contribute them to some much desired employee benefits. When the lease ended, we did not renew, and there’s not been a single complaint to the best of my knowledge. Exactly. Commercial Real Estate is expensive. Until you can get that off your balance sheet, companies will insist on Return to Office. It doesn’t matter at all what employees want to do, or even if it’s better to work from home. Rule #1 of microeconomics: Ignore sunk costs. Nothing about whether employees are in the office or not changes the fact that the lease has already been signed and the future cash flow is obligated to it. Lease? How about if the company *owns* the building. That’s the instance with the office where I am. I think the outside of business hour calls are a distraction. If this business existed in the before times they surely navigated phone calls then. Is it nice to have more options? Perhaps (although for whom??? because separation of work and life is a good thing). I totally agree with Allison and the commenters about there needing to be consequences or not. Having an unenforced policy is the same as not having a policy. he certainly wouldn’t be the first CEO to cling to an old way of operating because that’s what he’s comfortable with, without recognizing that the workforce has changed, or that what technology makes possible has changed, or that what top talent in your field will demand has changed. Honestly, these folks, even the younger ones, need to retire. It’s not about age — it’s the inflexibility. I get that commercial rents can be steep, especially in larger cities, but if that’s the main problem, there has to be a solution. Move the office maybe — I don’t know. What I do know is that workers with in-demand skills will bail over stuff like this. I remember in early 2020 and even into 2021, there were so many articles about how there was going to be a reckoning in the workplace and things were going to permanently change, and I just had to side-eye it a bit because my experience was that senior leadership was mostly stuck in their ways and seemingly incapable of adapting to a new reality at the best of times. Everyone thought work-from-home was here to stay, but these leaders were just counting down the days that everything could go back to 2019, not finding a way to manage their workforce differently. Which is fine, that’s their prerogative and they can do whatever they want with their workforce, but I think anyone making that choice surrenders the right to ever be called innovative or forward-thinking as a leader ever again. I think what those back-to-2019 leaders don’t understand is that the burden of proof has shifted. Pre-COVID a leader resistant to WFH could always demand “more proof” that the employee would be just as productive, connected, etc. Well, 202o provided that proof and more. Senior leaders who don’t realize that and think that motivational poster slogans and declarations that “it’s time” and “COVID’s over” are going to be convincing or motivating are going to be disappointed, in the long run. There may not be an immediate exit, but there will be damage. Of course they can demand that their employees return to the office, but if they do not want to damage their credibility they will need to provide some actual justifications for why the employees need to come back. My first question is: Do you have flexible work hours? If not, bringing that in or codifying it (core hours, min hours per day max hours per day) could help maintain some of the value of WfH flexibility. Honestly, I’d try to get a different job. You’re tired, demoralised, unappreciated – leave. When you get a new role, encourage all your staff to brush up their resumes and interviewing skills to leave, too. Sometimes what is needed is “how about Go F Yourself?” for a person in the CEO’s position to understand that them *wanting* something doesn’t make it *important* or *valuable* to the business. In some cases that means they learn, in others they get replaced, in others they get outvoted on policies, and in others the business tanks because they have a shitty reputation and big staff loss. Truth hurts. My situation is complex. I do often think to myself that my junior staff would be better off elsewhere. I’m waiting for them to figure it out. The RTO mandate will make them think of that more quickly for sure. “I’ve never worked as hard as I’ve had to this past year, due to layoffs and terrible clients. It’s so demoralizing working until 11 pm sometimes and still be expected to be cheery the next morning in-office for the benefit of an out-of-touch CEO.” Sounds like your best bet for how to deal with this problem is to GTFO and let it be someone else’s problem. This is exactly what’s happening at my midsize government office. Three days butts in seats no questions or excuses. And the GM has forced all non union represented staff back in full time. I have a hybrid role often working in the field, have a company vehicle, etc. I am equipped as a field staff. I also am one of the folks who absolutely benefits from and is more productive doing remote work, and I am a leader in my department and highly productive, so it rots my socks that someone six managers above me who doesn’t even know what I do for the organization let alone my name should be able to dictate where I do my job. Meanwhile, all our team meetings are still on zoom because we have three conference rooms for 600 people, and they’re cutting our cubicles in half because they’re running out of space to put people. And yes, should the 5 day mandate come down, I will absolutely leave over this. They’ll lose an experienced project manager and changemaker with 22 years of experience. Until then, Allison is absolutely hitting the nail on the head – what is the consequence of ignoring in office mandates? I suspect I’ll be one of the first to find out. They can try me. At this point, it’s been a generation since remote work started, and 5 years since covid. Everyone has an opinion on WFH, it’s mainly based on their own personal experience, and it’s not changing. Counter evidence can be dismissed as unreliable, beside the point, or a price worth paying for the greater good. So let’s all move on. Literally, if the policy doesn’t fit the life you want. I actually think the truest and most important thing you said is this: “I don’t want to care about this.” Stop caring about it. It’s not your decision to make, and you’ve done what you can. Let it go. Tell your employees that the CEO has decided XYZ and HR or whoever has instructed that people who don’t follow the rule will be put on a PIP/fired. You know how the kids are into quiet quitting? Take a leaf from their book. Do your job, don’t stress about it. Easier said than done. And maybe start looking for a job? I’m sure you’ve considered it; this place sounds like it’s stressing you out in more ways than one. In the legal and security areas, there’s a view on how employees engage with regulation. Its very similar to how people view change. At the far-right, you have the champions. And yes, we want people to champion change because we like people to be active and accountable and all that. They see the value and care for it, and in championing they try to make other people see the value. But the middle of the diagram, the point that people need to meet for the change to happen, is not “acceptance”, is is “compliance”. It is okay for people to not want a change. It is okay for them to believe it is silly. It is okay for them to believe its not valuable. They just to have to it regardless. You aren’t actually here to change their minds. You do not need to care. You do not need to champion to make other people care. You just need to go back to the line of “we are required to work from the office. I am going to measure your compliance, and if you do not comply I will act accordingly. How you feel doesn’t change what we’re required to do.” Unpopular Opinion: people making no effort to comply to the RTO order should be put on a PIP and then fired if they don’t comply. Because THEY are ruining it for everyone. So many people are doing their best to keep the flexibility and a few selfish jerks shouldn’t be able to ruin it for everyone. Also as someone who has run the gamut between in-office hybrid and fully remote AND was unemployed for 9 months last year i will continue to scream till im blue in the face that this job market is horrible, the hiring process has been absolutely destroyed by AI and the only way you can get an interview is if you know someone… maybe. Please don’t lose your job over being stubborn about RTO. Now is not the time. I don’t know if it needs to be as strong as a PIP, but this manager seems to have decided that, having opted to allow her staff to do 2 days instead of 3 in office (And thus already bending the rules), she can’t do anything about people who bend the limit she DID set, and never show up, or can’t be reached. And she absolutely can! She’s a manager! This is an extremely timely question, on Tuesday we got an email that we NEED to be in the office for at least 3 days a week up from our 1 that we could skip with a reason. From what my division manager has said is that he will not be enforcing it for our division since we have proven time & time again that we can work remotely successfully. However for the next few weeks it would be best to be in the office more often. We work well doing 1 day a week in the office and coming in to the facilities as needed when our projects are being worked on the shop floors. The 3 days would be up to us to choose what days we want to come in and which of 2 facility we want to work out of. The biggest issue is that up until early Fall we were in the upstairs of our 1st, original, facility and were moved to a new smaller area in the 2nd facility (~1 mile away). Our projects are located between both facilities but more are being moved to the 2nd facility from what we have been told. When we were upstairs at the 1st facility, the division manager and lower project managers all had nice offices and the rest of us engineers had nice sized large desks. The new 2nd facility area has ‘breakout rooms’ which the managers claimed since it was the closest to an office, but they lack desks (have tables instead) and don’t have multiple monitor setups, only a large TV on the wall. We got much smaller desks that were meant to be hot swappable with no separations between them and no storage for our samples, test equipment, and catalogs we need to reference when doing our jobs, it feels like we are now in a call center instead of an engineering facility. We also have to travel with our projects, so there have been times (before 2020) that I was not in the office for weeks at a time due to working off-site when everyone else was in the office full time. The big boss (the one who demanded the change to a minimum of 3 days) still has his extremely large office in the 1st faculty, and I have only seen him at the 2nd location twice in the past 3 years since we had it. There is a large discontentment in our division right now but our direct managers don’t want to do this either, so it is nice for them to have our backs. I just wanted to suggest commenters think about how all this would read to someone lower-income who has to go into their workplace daily and WFH is *never* an option, such as grocery store workers, etc., those who were so essential during the pandemic. I usually don’t say “check your privilege,” but I think that certain applies in this thread. Not. Relevant. They chose their career/job. Those that work remote chose theirs. How many currently remote workers chose remote? I’d bet a lot of them just fell into it due to the pandemic and their employers not returning to the office. Doesn’t matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s $3 trillion run-up in market value in the two years since ChatGPT helped trigger an AI frenzy is bigger than any stock rally in history in such a short time span. But the landscape is now changing for the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that. Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam. “I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.” That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday. Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory. “Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.” Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago. That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year: AI Spending Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI. “At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares. Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology. So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth. “It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said. Competition Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024. Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia. However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore. “Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December. And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023. Valuation How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up. For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.” Top Tech Stories The US plans to unveil more regulations aimed at keeping advanced chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other producers from flowing to China, part of a flurry of measures introduced by the Biden administration during its final days in office. Elon Musk cheated Twitter shareholders out of more than $150 million by waiting too long to disclose his growing stake in the company as he prepared a takeover bid, the US Securities and Exchange Commission claimed in a lawsuit filed days before the Trump administration takes over. SpaceX launched a pair of commercial satellites carrying lunar rovers as competition intensifies in the private sector’s race to the moon. Alphabet Inc.

Estimates for California's devastating fires continue to grow with some estimates reaching as high ... [+] as $180 billion. (Photo by David Swanson / AFP) (Photo by DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks were mixed on Tuesday with the S&P 500 up just 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. Both the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The muted moves came following the release of the Producer Price Index, which showed slower than expected increases in prices. Tuesday's Core PPI was forecast to show an increase of 0.4% on a month-to-month basis, but the actual increase was just 0.2%. That number offered a preview of today's Consumer Price Index, which was expected to show core prices increased month-over-month by 0.3% and a yearly increase of 3.3%, according to Bloomberg. The actual numbers were slightly below those expectations. Month-over-month was up 0.2% while year-over-year, prices were higher by 3.2%. Turning to earnings, major banks are kicking things off this morning. So far, we've heard from JP Morgan who beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending that stock higher by 2% in premarket. Wells Fargo also beat on earnings. One standout metric was their investment banking fees which grew by 59%. Wells in not typically the first name that comes to mind when discussing investment banking, so this may be an area of growth to keep an eye on. But net interest income is the standout metric here for both banks. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo forecast strong growth for net interest income in 2025. Goldman Sachs also released their earnings in premarket. The company crushed expectations across the board. Goldman said it expected investment banking and trading fees to grow double digits in 2025. Lastly, Citigroup is out with earnings, issuing beats on the top and bottom lines. All four banking stocks are trading higher in premarket activity. A few other stocks in the news include Meta, Alphabet and Eli Lilly. Meta announced it will more aggressively manage out underperforming workers and as a result the company will cut 5% of its workforce in the U.S. As the job market is cooling, we're seeing the power pendulum swing back towards companies. This comes after a red-hot labor market was giving job seekers a significant advantage following Covid. Alphabet is being investigated by U.K antitrust regulators over how Google search results may affect competition. Lastly, Eli Lilly cut its fourth-quarter forecast citing weaker than expected growth for the company's insulin and weight loss drugs. However, the company did say they expect strong growth for their weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in 2025. Turning to the chip sector, the Biden administration announced it plans more regulations for advanced chips being produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and others from being exported to China. Another stock in the AI chip sector that's making news is Nvidia. Shares of that stock have fallen for the past five trading days and are down 12% from their highs, putting the stock in a correction. This is particularly noteworthy because Nvidia has been at the forefront of the stock market rally over the past couple years. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if this is simply some short-term profit taking, the beginning of a longer-term downturn for the overall market, or a changing of the guard and opportunity for another sector to lead the market. A few more odds and ends. After hitting a low of just over $89,000 on Monday, bitcoin is trading higher and looks set to make another run at $100,000. Oil prices remain within striking distance of $80 per barrel. As I've previously mentioned, so long as oil remains below $80, its impact on the economy is relatively muted. However, a break above $80 may prompt fears of a return of inflation. Finally, Forbes is saying the cost from the California fires may reach as high as $150 billion. This is simply a tragic story and one that, unfortunately, continues to unfold. For today, the story is a combination of earnings and muted inflation. The outlook for the banking sector, especially net interest income, is being buoyed by forecasts for fewer interest rates cuts by the Fed. Elevated rates mean more interest income. The outlook for rates should come as no surprise to regular readers of my column as I've been discussing it ad nauseam. Combine that with a weaker than expected CPI and you get stocks up nearly 2% in premarket trading. I would caution readers that this is just the very beginning of earnings season and there is a long way to go still. However, the start is looking pretty good and may be exactly what this market needs. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Accurate energy demand forecasting is critical for efficient energy management and planning. Recent advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets have fueled the development of machine learning models. However, selecting the most appropriate features to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness remains a key challenge. This study proposes an ensemble approach that integrates a genetic algorithm with multiple forecasting models to optimize feature selection. The genetic algorithm identifies the optimal subset of features from a dataset that includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal characteristics. These selected features are then used to train three base learners: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The predictions from these models are combined using a stacking ensemble technique to generate the final forecast. To enhance model evaluation, we divided the dataset into weekday and weekend subsets, allowing for a more detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted ten simulations and applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to the results. The proposed model demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 130.6, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.38%, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 99.41 for weekday data. The model also maintained high accuracy for weekend predictions, with an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This research provides valuable insights for energy analysts and contributes to developing more sophisticated demand forecasting methods.

In the modern era, accurate energy demand forecasting has become an essential component of efficient energy management. Energy consumption is rising for various reasons, such as population growth, increasing building energy needs, and expanding technological applications. According to the data presented in [1], global energy consumption is expected to rise by approximately 70% by the year 2040. This alarming figure has necessitated the development of advanced predictive models to forecast energy demand, which are crucial for optimizing energy use in smart cities, thereby making them more efficient and sustainable. Machine learning models have become increasingly popular due to advancements in computational techniques and the availability of large amounts of data [2]. However, a critical challenge in these models is the effective selection of relevant features that enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address this issue, we have implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal feature selection. The study first trains the model to determine the best features from the dataset with the help of GA; afterward, these features are fed into a stacking-based ensemble model for further training and evaluation. At its core, energy demand forecasting may be broken down into two distinct ways: traditional methods and more modern machine learning-based techniques [3, 4]. Conventional methods include statistical analysis, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (EA), and regression-based approaches [5]. These methods have proven effective for linear problems. On the other hand, machine learning methods are adept at handling non-linear scenarios. Notable among these are Random Forest (RF) [6], Decision Tree (DT) [7], and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [8], which have been utilized for energy demand forecasting, as discussed in recent studies. However, it is important to note that while machine learning models offer substantial advantages in time series prediction, they are also susceptible to limitations, such as the potential for becoming trapped in local minima, particularly if hyperparameters are not optimally tuned. Several diverse methods have been developed for forecasting future energy consumption, from the very short term (minutes) to the very long term (years) (weeks) [9, 10]. Accurately predicting energy demand is crucial; an overestimation can lead to unnecessary conversion of excess energy, which is costly in terms of time, money, and resources, while underestimation may result in blackouts from supply line overloads. Typically, forecasting is divided into three categories based on the prediction horizon: short-term load forecasting (from an hour to a week), medium-term load forecasting (from a month to a year), and long-term load forecasting (beyond a year) [11]. Prediction of short-term loads is a major challenge. Indeed, schedules may be created to determine the distribution of generating resources, operational limits, environmental restrictions, and equipment usage restrictions with the help of accurate and dependable predictions [12]. In addition, the power systems may be optimized more using these predictions for the expected load condition in the future. Key contributions of this paper are as follows: The evolution of the paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the related work of the study has been explained in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the methodology used in this study. The experimental setup for the training of our model is then described in Section 4. Our proposed framework is presented in Section 5. The obtained results are carefully examined and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents a summary of the key findings, discusses their implications, and suggests directions for further investigation. Electricity distribution networks are foundational to long-term prosperity and societal advancement. Power consumption forecasts must always be accurate and efficient when developing energy predictions for the dynamic electricity sector. In the dynamic electricity sector, power consumption forecasts must be both precise and efficient. Over recent decades, a myriad of methods for predicting future energy demand has emerged [13, 14]. Typically, these methods employ time series datasets of past energy usage to construct forecasting models [15]. The majority of the approaches presented for predicting a building’s energy usage may be broken down into two classes: statistical and artificial intelligence-based. For forecasting and analyzing energy use in the future, statistical approaches use the available historical data to build probabilistic models. ARIMA, ARMA, and ARIMAX are well-known statistical methods that have been used to predict future energy consumption. However, AI-driven approaches can improve forecasting accuracy due to their ability to identify non-linear trends in time series data [16]. Despite the widespread use of feature selection techniques like correlation-based, filter, and wrapper methods in research, there remains a significant opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated techniques to refine these predictions further. LSTM networks have demonstrated promising results in time series analysis [17]. Older variants of RNNs, such as Recurrent Backpropagation, require a very long time to learn and store the information over an extended period. To address these challenges, Hochreiter et al. [18] developed a gradient-based method called LSTM neural network [19], which is the extended version of a recurrent neural network. LSTM networks have both long-term memory and short-term memory, and it reduces the problem of exploding and vanishing gradient. Numerous researchers have leveraged the LSTM network to forecast energy demand. Bouktif et al. [20] integrated various machine learning models along with LSTM to develop a model for short-term load demand of energy. In another study, the authors [21] presented a statistical model, SARIMA, to predict hourly wind speed in the coastal area of Scotland. They utilized three-time series datasets collected from different elevations. The accuracy of the forecasting model can be enhanced by using a combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous models. Li et al. [22] considered this benefit and proposed a multi-energy forecasting method for energy systems using a fusion of a Convolutional Neural Network and GRU (CNN-GRU) with transfer learning on a parallel architecture. The performance of the model was further refined through hyperparameter tuning, leading to more accurate results. A summary of notable studies on demand forecasting is provided in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t001 Significant progress has been made in enhancing energy demand forecasting using deep learning models. However, a gap remains in optimizing feature selection within these models. To address this gap, we propose a two-tiered approach. The first step involves applying a genetic algorithm to identify and select the most influential features. In the subsequent step, we employ a stacking ensemble method that combines the strengths of multiple predictive models. This synergistic approach not only refines the feature set but also integrates various models to substantially improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts. Numerous studies have explored data-driven techniques due to their ability to predict loads and energy consumption across various scenarios [33]. The standard data-driven approach typically minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances to determine the optimal parameters [34]. A widely used method is linear regression [35], which identifies the best-fitting straight line across the training data. In addition to the linear model, ridge regression penalizes the extreme values of the weighted matrix to deal with multi-collinearity [36]. There has been a noticeable improvement in the development and interpretation of these linear regression models. An example of a non-parametric model is the K-nearest neighbor, in which the forecast is just the mean of all the neighbors [37]. With the optimal parameter settings, this method provides accurate outcomes for electrical load forecasting; it is also relatively easy to understand and implement in practice. Rather than relying on a single decision tree, which can lead to overfitting, ensemble models employ a network of decision trees to make predictions, such as additional trees and random forests. Gradient boosting further enhances tree accuracy by employing an ensemble of weak learners that assign greater weight to misclassified predictions [38]. The objective of this study is to develop an advanced method for predicting energy consumption. This is accomplished by integrating deep learning models using a stacking ensemble approach with a feature selection process optimized through a genetic algorithm (GA). With GA, our goal is to find the optimal Chromosome C*, that maximizes Fitness (C) as given in Eq (1) (1) Where C = [c1, c2, ……, cn] is the chromosome, and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. With stacking, our goal is to minimize the loss function using the feature subset X' chosen by the GA and forecasts generated by the stacking model given in Eq (2) (2) Here Mj(X') represents the prediction output of the j-th model, and S is the stacking layer function that aggregates the prediction from the individual models. In summary, the GA enhances the quality of the model input by optimizing the feature space, whereas the stacked model utilizes the advantages of numerous deep learning architectures to provide reliable prediction outputs. In this subsection, we outline the key challenges in energy demand forecasting and explain how our proposed method effectively addresses each challenge. The high-dimensional nature of datasets in energy demand forecasting presents a significant challenge in selecting the most relevant features [39]. This task is computationally intensive and often includes redundant or irrelevant features, which can degrade model performance. This study employs a GA to search for the optimal subset of features systematically. The GA uses a fitness function based on the inverse of Mean Squared Error to evaluate predictive accuracy given in Eq (3) (3) Where C is a chromosome representing a subset of features. A crucial challenge in energy demand forecasting is preventing overfitting by ensuring the model works effectively with unknown data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new data [40]. By using the GA to determine the most informative features, our approach improves the model’s generalizability. The high-dimensional feature spaces might result in longer training times and more resource use due to the computational complexity. This challenge is significant in practical applications where computing efficiency is the highest priority. Our genetic algorithm-based approach addresses this difficulty by decreasing the number of features. The GA progressively improves the feature subset, reducing input space that retains the most significant features. Let n be the original number of features and k the number of selected features after GA optimization, where k < n. In this section, we provide a concise overview of the methodologies employed in this study. This section presents an introduction to the basics of time series analysis. To get a more thorough analysis of time series analysis, we suggest reading [41, 42]. Time Series (TS) analysis is a valuable tool for studying energy demand patterns, which inherently vary over time due to their time-dependent nature. It involves applying statistical or artificial intelligence methods to predict future trends by analyzing previously collected information. A time series composed of P real-valued data points a1, …., aP each ai (where 1 ≤ i ≤ P) signifies the value recorded at the time i. The task of time series forecasting can be described as predicting future values az+1, …. az+k based on the preceding a1, …, az values (where z + k ≤ P). The goal here is to reduce the difference between the forecasted value and the actual value az+j (for 1 ≤ j ≤ k). In this context, ‘z’ represents the historical window, indicating the number of past data points considered for making predictions, and ‘k’ denotes the prediction horizon, which is the extent of the future we aim to predict. Time series analysis has been applied in a wide range of real-life applications such as Anomaly detection [43], financial indices [44], Healthcare [45], Weather prediction, and energy consumption [46]. In contrast to traditional approaches, which focus on parametric-based models, namely auto-regressive, Moving Average, and structural TS [47], the Artificial intelligence-based model offers purely data-driven approaches. GA are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics [48]. With this technique, our goal is to identify the subset of features that contributes the most to the predictive power of a given model. In this study, we employed the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library, which provides a flexible and customizable framework for creating genetic algorithms. Below is a detailed description of the GA process for feature selection. Let C = [c1, c2, ……, cn ] be a chromosome, where n is the number of features and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. The fitness of an individual is evaluated based on the performance of the model using the selected subset of features. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the fitness metric presented in Eq (4). The goal is to find the optimal chromosome C* that maximizes Fitness (C) Formally: The steps employed for determining the best features are shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g001 The GA identifies the best subset of features from the dataset, which includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal features, by exploring various combinations to maximize predictive accuracy. The GA reduces redundancy and noise by choosing only the most relevant features, resulting in more accurate and robust model training. This optimized feature set enhances the model’s performance, allowing it to generalize better from training data to unseen data, as shown by improved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Furthermore, reducing the number of features decreases computational complexity, leading to faster training times without sacrificing accuracy. Ensemble models have gained popularity in recent years mainly because of the great outcomes they produce on various tasks, such as classification and regression issues [49]. These techniques include the combination of multiple models of learning to enhance the performance of each model individually. Ensemble learning was first explored in the 1990s when it proved that many weak learners could be turned into strong learners. Typically, two stages are involved in this process. Initially, a variety of base learners are developed from the training data. Subsequently, these learners are combined in the second stage to create a cohesive prediction model. This results in multiple forecasts derived from individual base learners being merged into a more effective composite model, which typically outperforms each of the base models. Consolidating several effective individual models into a single enhanced model usually results in greater predictive accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and stacking are the three most popular and well-known fundamental ensemble approaches [50]. In bagging, multiple models are created, with each model’s results given equal weight, and a voting method determines the most common outcome. For regression, the mean of predictions is typically used. Boosting, similar to bagging, differs by assigning varying weights to models, with the final result being a weighted vote. In regression contexts, this means a weighted average. On the other hand, Stacking employs different algorithms for model building, followed by a combiner algorithm that uses these models’ outputs to make final predictions. Any ensemble approach can be used as the combiner in stacking. Ensemble learning techniques have been applied in various time series forecasting methods, including energy demand. Zhang et al. [51] introduced an extreme learning machine (ELM) method utilized in the electricity market. Tan et al. [52] combined wavelet transform with ARIMA and GARCH models for price forecasting in Spanish and PJM electricity markets. In another study, authors [49] developed an ensemble model using Bayesian Clustering by Dynamics (BCD) and SVM, which was tested on New York City’s historical load data. Later, Tasnim et al. [21] created an ensemble framework based on the cluster for predicting wind power, employing regression models on wind data from various Australian locations. LSTM is a specific form of RNN structure developed to tackle the challenge of the vanishing gradient problem and efficiently capture the patterns in sequential data [53]. This is achieved by utilizing a specialized gating mechanism that effectively controls the transmission of information within the network. A standard LSTM unit has three primary gates, as shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g002 where w and b are weights and biases and ⏀ represent activation function, which is sigmoid in our study. Uf is a weight matrix associated with the forget gate. Unlike standard LSTM, BiLSTM is able to learn from both the past and future as processes input in both directions. This feature enhances its capability to model sequential dependencies in language processing tasks. BiLSTM involves adding an additional LSTM layer that processes the input sequence in reverse. The outputs of both forward and backward layers are then merged using techniques like averaging, summing, multiplying, or concatenating. The unrolled BiLSTM structure is presented in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g003 The forward and backward propagation output of the above diagram has been shown below: Eqs (11), (12), and (13). Where x, h, and c are the input state, hidden state, and temporary state. The GRU model demonstrates superior computational efficiency by employing a lower number of training parameters. As a result, memory utilization and training times are reduced. The simpler architecture, consisting of two gates, Eqs (14) and (15), reduces the possibility of overfitting on smaller datasets. Moreover, the GRU shows improved stability during the training process, requiring reduced fine-tuning for hyperparameters. Fig 4 shows a simple GRU network. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g004 Update Gate (Zt): (14) Reset Gate (Rt): (15) where W are the weights, and σ represents the activation function. ht-1 are the hidden states. The stochastic nature of deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and GA, where random initializations and training processes can lead to variability in performance, makes it crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of our results [54]. We conducted repeated simulations to address this, running each model 10 times with different random seeds. We recorded the performance metrics for each run, including MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Eqs (18)–(21) provide the equations for these metrics. To statistically compare the performance metrics across different runs, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This non-parametric test is suitable for comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test does not assume normality, making it a robust choice for our analysis [55]. This test works by ranking the absolute differences between paired observations, assigning ranks, and then computing the sum of ranks for the positive and negative differences. The test statistic W is the smaller of these sums. The p-value is derived from the distribution of W under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the paired samples. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is calculated as follows: We collected the dataset containing information on net demand and consumption in the UK, covering the period from 2020 to 2023. While preparing the data, we apply techniques to handle missing data points, which are represented as NaN or null values within our dataset. To impute the missing values, we calculate the mean μ and median σ, that can effectively transform a feature set X from X = {x1, x2, …., xn} to , where x’i = xi if xi is not missing, and x'i = μ or σ otherwise. There are three categories of data transformation that are typically utilized in the neural network. In this model, we used linear transformation Eq (16), which scales the data either into (0 to 1) or (-1 to +1) range. In order to account for any differences in data behavior, the dataset is analyzed by classifying it according to temporal patterns, specifically by differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The entire dataset is divided into two parts. 80% of the data was chosen for training, while the remaining 20% was used for validation. Validation data is further refined by dividing data into four distinct samples (S1, S2, S3, S4), enabling a comprehensive evaluation that enhances the robustness and generalizability of findings. The dataset contains a total of 43 features, out of which, after applying GA, we got the four highly correlated features with the target feature for the training for our model. We have done exploratory analysis on these features to get better insights about the data. We separate a single feature on which we wish to make the prediction. In our case, it is Net Demand. We need to scale this feature, so we used the MinMaxScaler library of Python. The dataset did not contain any missing values. The two-month training graph shows a strong daily cyclical pattern with daytime peaks and nighttime drops, as shown in Fig 5. Energy demand ranges between 17,500 and 35,000 daily, showing no long-term trend. The graph’s density shows high-frequency data collection, providing an in-depth view of energy consumption trends with potential outliers from demand drops. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g005 We further illustrated the variations in net energy demand over weekdays and weekends in April and May 2023. It is possible to see a pattern of highs and lows that repeats itself every day, with times when demand rises and times when it falls. Demand changes a lot during the week, with higher levels of consumption during the day and lower levels of demand at night. This repetitive behavior can also be seen on the weekends, but the volume isn’t as strong. This could be because people use the system differently when they don’t have to work during the week Fig 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g006 Additionally, we used box plots to examine the distribution of energy generation features between weekdays and weekends. The visual representations shown in Fig 7 clearly illustrate a noticeable difference in the core tendencies and variabilities of the two temporal segments. The interquartile ranges shown indicate a greater level of uniformity in energy production patterns on weekdays compared to weekends, especially in the ‘GENERATION’ and ‘FOSSIL’ categories. Outliers, identified by the data points located outside the whiskers of the box plots, were present in both categories, indicating occasional deviations from the usual energy production levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g007 In this study, we have adopted a stacking approach for the regression problem, considering it the most appropriate, as discussed in [56]. The general structure of this method is illustrated in Fig 8. To define the stacking ensemble scheme more precisely, given P distinct learning algorithms Mh, for k = 1 to P, and the data pair 〈a, b〉 {a = (a1, …., az) representing the recorded z values and b = (az+1, …., az+k) k values to be predicted}, let , (for h = 1 to P, j = 1 to k) be the model generated by Mh to forecast az+j. The function gj, which combines these models for prediction, can be a standard function developed through another algorithm utilizing a machine learning system. The predicted value is then calculated using this method, Eq (17). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g008 In this work, we have employed and optimized various hyperparameters, such as Epoch, which represents a complete iteration of training data. Dropout mitigated the issue of overfitting. The learning rate refers to the pace at which the model updates its parameters during training. Batch size, on the other hand, represents the number of samples processed by the network at each iteration. The hidden layer, positioned between the input and output layers, determines the number of nodes it should contain. In order to optimize GPU utilization, we have implemented a batch size of 12. Additionally, we have chosen a dropout rate of 0.2 to mitigate overfitting. The dropout rate is 0.2. By removing 20% of the nodes in the hidden layer, we effectively minimize the occurrence of overfitting. The learning rate should not be very low; hence, the learning rate is adjusted to 0.1. After all these adjustments, we achieved a reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) to a level below 0.01, as shown in Fig 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g009 The efficacy of our study was evaluated using several variables [57]. The following procedures were used for each, and we have shown in these equations in Eqs (18), (19), (20), and (21) The accuracy of a model is calculated from MAPE. Our proposed method includes a multi-step process that starts with data preparation and culminates with evaluating the predictions. Technically, a common preprocessing formula for data preprocessing and feature selections is presented in Eqs (22) and (23), Here, D is the original dataset, Dp is the preprocessed dataset, and ∅ is the preprocessing function that includes data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and temporal feature extraction. Here Fs is the set of selected features, and GA is the Genetic Algorithm applied to Dp for feature selection. We deploy three base deep learning models, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, which we have already discussed in section 3.3. The LSTM model is adept at capturing long-term dependencies, the BiLSTM model leverages information from both past and future time points, and the GRU model efficiently models short-term dependencies shown in Eqs (24)–(26). Here, ht represents the hidden state at time t. The hidden states of each base learner are combined using a stacking ensemble approach with a linear regression meta-learner presented in Eqs (27) and (28), respectively. Here, H is the concatenated hidden states from each base learner, is the predicted energy demand, and β0, β1, β2, β3 are the coefficients learned by the meta-learner. When the whole procedure is expressed as an equation, it can be written as in Eq (29) (29) Fig 10 demonstrates the entire process of the proposed framework. The model comprises several stages. A thorough preprocessing procedure is applied to the dataset, which includes data cleaning to fix errors, data transformation to organize the information for analysis, variable standardization to make them more comparable, and temporal feature extraction to take advantage of trends that change over time. After the preprocessing is completed, a genetic algorithm is then used for feature selection. This computational evolution approach uses mutation and crossover to enhance the prediction skills of the feature set population, mimicking natural selection. The whole GA process is shown in Fig 1. We evaluate the fitness of each feature set based on how well it predicts energy use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g010 In the model implementation phase, three separate recurrent neural networks—GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM—are trained as the base models using the features that GA selected. We used a stacking ensemble approach to best use each neural network’s capabilities. A meta-model is trained in this ensemble to merge the forecasts of the GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM basis models into a single, more precise prediction. In the last stage, statistical matrices such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are used to measure the accuracy of forecasts and conduct a thorough evaluation of this composite model’s performance. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through multiple metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Detailed mathematical formulations for these evaluation metrics are provided in Section 4.6. In the dataset analyzed for this study, two distinct energy demand patterns were identified, as shown in Fig 6. The first pattern is associated with weekends, where a notable decrease in energy demand is observed. In contrast, the second pattern corresponds to weekdays, characterized by a consistent increase in energy demand. The data was systematically categorized according to these patterns, and the model was then trained to handle them effectively. The results of this comparative analysis are displayed in Fig 11 for the weekday pattern and in Fig 12 for the weekend pattern. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g012 After training the architecture presented in this study using the data patterns illustrated in Fig 6, we first tested the model on the training dataset. The outcomes of this test are detailed in Table 2. To further our objective, we then evaluated the model’s performance using a hidden validation dataset from the energy demand data. The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t003 An additional performance assessment was also conducted by dividing the entire validation dataset into four distinct samples. The model’s performance was then re-evaluated on each of these samples separately. The outcomes of these evaluations are documented in Fig 13 and Table 4. Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t004 In the final analysis, individual models using LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM architectures were developed for the identified demand patterns. Their comparative performance is illustrated in Fig 14. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g014 In Table 4, we provide a comprehensive evaluation, presenting the overall performance scores of all models across the four validation samples. Deep learning models are inherently stochastic, which means that they can produce different results on different executions. To demonstrate the reliability of our proposed model, we executed the entire program ten times. For each run, we recorded the error metrics, as shown in Tables 5 and 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t006 To determine if the differences in performance metrics across different runs were statistically significant, we applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results are summarized in Table 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t007 The p-values indicate whether there is a significant difference between the models’ performances over multiple runs. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant difference. In this case, the p-values for all comparisons (Ensemble vs. LSTM, Ensemble vs. BiLSTM, and Ensemble vs. GRU) across all metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are 0.001953125, which is significantly less than the 0.05 threshold. This demonstrates that the ensemble model consistently shows a statistically significant improvement in performance over the individual models. The prediction accuracy criteria for assessment are schematically shown in Fig 15. Most of the error lies around zero. Therefore, mathematical findings confirm the predicted accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g015 The findings indicate that the Stacking-GA model consistently achieves better results compared to the separate deep learning models in all criteria during both weekdays and weekends. In Sample S1 on weekdays, the Stacking-GA model had the lowest MAE (494.62) for weekdays Fig 16(A), and MAE (534.25) for weekends Fig 16(B), which indicates its improved predictive accuracy compared to the solo models. Similarly, the observed trend is stable in all samples, suggesting that the ensemble technique successfully captures the fundamental patterns in energy consumption. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g016 The RMSE values, which indicate the level of volatility in the predictions, drop in the following order: LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and Stacking-GA. This further highlights the resilience of the ensemble approach. Furthermore, the MAPE shown in Fig 17(A) and 17(B), and RMSE shown in Fig 18(A) and 18(B) provide additional evidence supporting the enhanced precision and dependability of the Stacking-GA model. The performance difference amongst the models is particularly evident on weekends, possibly indicating the enhanced challenge of predicting energy demand during these periods due to less predictable consumption patterns.

RMSE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g018 In summary, the Stacking-GA model demonstrates a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to individual deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. Due to the stochastic nature of these models, we conducted repeated simulations, running each model ten times with different random seeds and recording the performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) for each run. To ensure the reliability of our results, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare the performance metrics across the different runs. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results, with p-values of 0.001953125 for all comparisons, indicate a statistically significant improvement in the performance of the ensemble model over the individual models across all metrics. The enhanced performance in energy demand forecasting is likely attributed to the combination of feature selection, ensemble learning, and the incorporation of a Genetic Algorithm. The ensemble deep learning framework proposed in this study has significant implications and potential applications in real-world energy demand forecasting scenarios. It provides accurate and robust forecasts, which are crucial for various stakeholders in the energy section. The ensemble framework, which combines the LSTM, BiLST, and GRU models, improves the accuracy of energy demand predictions. Better accuracy is crucial for utility firms, grid operators, and policymakers to make well-informed choices about energy generation, distribution, and management. Our method is adaptable to various forecasting horizons, whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term. This adaptability makes it suitable for different applications, such as day-ahead forecasting for grid operation, week-ahead forecasting for maintenance scheduling, and long-term forecasting for infrastructure planning. The use of a GA for feature selection allows the framework to handle complex and high-dimensional data efficiently. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data from smart meters, weather stations, and other sources need to be processed to generate accurate forecasts. With developments in real-time data collecting and processing technology, our ensemble framework may be integrated into smart grid systems to give real-time energy demand forecasts. This has the potential to increase energy distribution efficiency and reliability while also making it easier to integrate distributed energy resources. This research presents a significant advancement in energy demand forecasting by introducing an innovative stacking ensemble approach. The integration of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM networks, underpinned by a genetic algorithm for feature selection, marks a novel methodology in addressing the complexities of energy demand prediction. We have also utilized the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for statistical validation and ran the simulations ten times to ensure our results hold up. The performance evaluation was conducted using three key metrics: RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. To ensure the model’s robustness against the variability in energy consumption patterns, the data was segmented into weekday and weekend categories for analysis. The results from the validation data highlight the model’s exceptional precision, with a weekday performance marked by an RMSE of 130.6, a MAPE of 0.38%, and an MAE of 99.41. For weekend projections, the model maintained its accuracy, recording an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This level of precision indicates the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complexities of energy demand patterns. Additionally, The use of a genetic algorithm for feature selection has proven to be a key factor in the model’s success. It efficiently identifies the most influential predictors, improving the model’s performance. Furthermore, The stacking-based ensemble model, integrating multiple deep learning techniques, showcases a robust framework that outperforms traditional single-model approaches in forecasting accuracy. The study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of feature selection in machine learning but also offers practical implications for energy analysts and policymakers. Enhancing the accuracy of energy demand forecasts aids in efficient energy management and planning, which is crucial in the context of growing energy needs and sustainability challenges.

Title: Meta's performance-based cuts could kick off a wider trend in tech

Full Content:
Hello there! Business Insider's Alistair Barr thought he was doing the right thing when he discouraged a colleague from joining a little-known startup back in 2016. Turns out he was wrong. Really wrong. The startup was OpenAI, and the former colleague, who thankfully didn't listen, is now an AI billionaire. In today's big story, Meta is looking to quickly get rid of low performers with companywide cuts as it prepares for what Mark Zuckerberg says will be an "intense year." What's on deck Markets: The saga of finding Jamie Dimon's replacement takes another twist. Tech: Microsoft employees across multiple divisions have been laid off. Business: President-elect Donald Trump announces plans for an external revenue service. But first, on the chopping block. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tired: Move fast and break things. Wired: Move fast and get rid of underperformers. Two years after Mark Zuckerberg's famous "Year of Efficiency" the Meta CEO is ratcheting things up a notch. The tech giant announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce with a focus on the lowest performers, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann and Hugh Langley report. Based on Meta's most-recent earnings report, that would amount to about 3,600 roles. In a memo to staff, Zuckerberg said the company is entering an "intense year" and the decision was made to "move out low-performers faster." So how does Meta plan on doing that? Jyoti and Pranav Dixit got their hands on an internal memo from a human-resources executive explaining how the job cuts will work. The key is reaching a 5% non-regrettable attrition rate this year. In case you don't speak HR mumbo jumbo, that describes workers Meta wouldn't mind losing. To get there, Meta managers will need to identify 12-15% of employees with performance ratings of "Met Most Expectations" or worse. Those who receive ratings of "Met Some" and "Did not Meet" will definitely be fired while those with a "Met Most" rating will be further evaluated by a director and VP before a decision is made. They won't have a lot of time to do it. Employees based in the US will find out about the cuts by February 10. Meta employees had plenty of questions about the strategy. Some got behind the idea. One wrote on an internal message board viewed by Jyoti and Hugh that "there is a need to raise the bar and I absolutely support this." Others, however, weren't as optimistic. Some wondered how — dare I say — efficient the process would be. The process is "marginally better than 'monkey's throwing darts,'" another employee wrote. Like it or not, it might be here to stay. An internal FAQ document viewed by BI hints that performance-related layoffs could become an annual tradition at Meta. The bigger question is whether the approach catches on at other companies. You could argue Zuckerberg's 2023 efficiency push kicked off a wider trend. (Or maybe it was bound to happen anyway.) Regular performance-based cuts aren't the standard in tech like they are in other industries, but they also aren't unheard of. Amazon, in particular, has leaned on performance-improvement plans in recent years. 1. Crypto might be a lot of things, but a currency isn't one of them. For all the attention digital currencies like bitcoin have gotten over the years, the likelihood they'll replace money (as some predicted) still seems farfetched. BI's Adam Rogers writes about how crypto has just become another way for people to gamble. 2. JPMorgan and BlackRock shake-up their executive ranks. Daniel Pinto, the bank's president and COO, will step down in June and plans to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, currently a co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, will replace Pinto as COO. The promotion isn't about CEO Jamie Dimon grooming a successor, though. Piepszak doesn't want the top job, leading to more questions about Dimon's succession plans. Meanwhile, the race to succeed another Wall Street titan — BlackRock's Larry Fink — took a turn with the departure of Mark Wiedman, who was widely viewed as a top candidate for the job. 3. What the Los Angeles wildfires mean for the economy. AccuWeather estimates the total economic cost could reach $275 billion. Goldman Sachs says it could rank as one of the costliest natural disasters as a share of GDP in US history. However, the bank isn't concerned about higher insurance costs meaningfully impacting inflation. In the meantime, here's a rundown on who could foot the enormous bill. 1. TikTok's fate hangs in the balance. US users are flocking to the Chinese app RedNote, and TikTok Shop sellers are testing out other e-marketplaces. Selling the app to an American owner isn't out of the question, though — there are reports that Chinese officials are considering an eleventh-hour sale to Elon Musk. MuskTok? Sure, why not. 2. Apple takes a hit despite launching AI iPhones. The tech giant had a standout 2024 with the debut of Apple Intelligence and the Vision Pro. However, its global market share of smartphone sales slipped due to the iPhone losing ground to competitors and its new AI feature not being available in Greater China — one of the company's major markets. 3. Exclusive: Layoffs sweep Microsoft. Employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming faced job cuts, two people familiar with the matter told BI. The layoffs are separate from the recent cuts targeting low-performers within the company, which BI previously reported. 1. Justin Baldoni's New York Times lawsuit could hinge on an emoji. The "It Ends With Us" director accused the paper of taking his publicists' quotes out of context. He said the paper omitted an emoji — an upside-down smile — that would've made it clear his publicist was being sarcastic, not serious. 2. Trump's got tax plans, but Congress holds the strings. The president-elect vowed to create an "external revenue service" to collect tariffs and revenue from foreign nations on Day One.

Posted on January 15, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Are you looking to build your website but don’t know where to start? In 2025, do-it-yourself web design will be more accessible than ever, offering cost-effective solutions, complete control over the look and feel of your site, and the chance to learn valuable new skills. However, taking the DIY route requires a time commitment and a willingness to learn. In this post, we’ll provide some helpful tips to guide you through the process, from planning your site’s structure to optimizing it for search engines. We’ll also introduce you to the top tools, like Divi, to build a website independently. Let’s get started. In this section, we’ll outline several key tips to help you create a successful website. These tips cover everything from planning and platform selection to design principles, user experience, content creation, and basic SEO. Following these guidelines, you’ll be well-equipped to build a professional and effective website, even with limited design experience. Before you dive into do-it-yourself web design or choose a platform for your website, you have to start with a solid plan. This crucial step will save you time, prevent potential headaches, and ensure your website does what you want it to do. Think of it as the blueprint for your website. Three key steps are defining your website’s purpose and goals, defining your target audience, and creating a basic outline. First and foremost, define your website’s purpose and goals. Decide your website’s goals by asking yourself a few questions. Do you wish to sell products or services, share your expertise or thoughts, generate leads, or provide information? Clearly defining your purchase will help guide you on the design, content, and overall strategy. Every website should have its niche, so spend time figuring that out before doing anything else. Another important part of the planning stage is defining your ideal customer. Are you looking to target users by demographics (age, location, gender, etc.), interests, or needs? Knowing your audience will help you choose appropriate content and images. Let’s face it: a website targeting younger adults will likely have a different look and feel than one targeting senior citizens. Finally, create a sitemap or basic outline of your site. A sitemap is a visual representation of your website’s structure and hierarchy. It maps out all of the pages on your site and how they connect. Creating a sitemap helps you organize your content, visualize the user experience, and help search engines understand your website’s structure. Take a look at the example sitemap flowchart below. As you can see, it does a good job of showcasing how users will use your site. By starting with a well-defined plan, you’ll set yourself up for success as you progress through the stages of do-it-yourself web design. With a plan in place, the next decision you’ll need to make is choosing the right platform for your site. There are two main options: website builders and content management systems (CMS). Understanding their differences is essential for making the best choice for your needs. Website builders like Wix or Squarespace, are user-friendly platforms designed for beginners with little to no design experience. They offer drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-designed templates and typically serve as an all-in-one platform with hosting included. Content management systems, like WordPress, are more powerful platforms that provide much more flexibility and control over your website. While they may initially require a slightly higher learning curve, they offer significantly more options and the ability to scale as your site grows. While website builders offer a good starting point for simple websites, we strongly recommend WordPress for its versatility and long-term potential. WordPress is an incredibly powerful platform that can create virtually any type of website, from blogs to business websites to e-commerce stores. Its open-source nature, vast community, and extensive library of themes and plugins make it the most flexible and scalable option for do-it-yourself web design. While learning may require more effort, the long-term benefits and control you gain are well worth it. The rest of this post will focus on tips and tricks for building a website with WordPress. Get WordPress Selecting the right hosting provider is an important decision that can directly impact your website’s performance, security, and overall success. A hosting provider stores your website’s files and makes them accessible to visitors. While there are several hosting types, each caters to different needs and budgets. In do-it-yourself web design, picking the right host is one of the most important decisions you can make. You might choose several types of hosting providers, including shared, VPS, managed, and cloud. The one you decide upon depends on the type of website you want now and in the future. To help you decide, here’s a brief overview of each hosting type and who it is best suited to: As the most affordable option, shared hosting shares server resources (RAM, CPU, and storage) with many other websites. It’s suitable for small websites with low to moderate traffic. Remember that performance can be affected if other websites on the server experience a spike in traffic or resource usage. A virtual private server (VPS) provides a virtual server that is separated from other users on the same physical server. It gives you more control over resources and better performance than shared hosting. VPS hosting is a good option for websites that require more resources and server customization. Managed WordPress hosting is specifically optimized for WordPress websites. It includes automatic updates, enhanced security, caching, a content delivery network (CDN), and a staging environment. Managed WordPress hosting is great for WordPress users who want to simplify website management and need enhanced performance. Cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected servers to host your website. It offers excellent scalability, reliability, and uptime. If one server goes down, another can take over, ensuring your website never goes down. There are a few factors to consider when choosing the best hosting provider. First is your website’s size and traffic requirements. Shared hosting might be a good fit for a small website with low traffic. However, as your website grows, you may need to update to a more robust solution, like VPS hosting. This decision is an important one in the process of do-it-yourself web design. You’ll also need to consider your level of technical expertise. VPS may be the way to go if you’re comfortable with server management. However, if you prefer a more hands-off approach where everything is handled for you, managed WordPress hosting is a good option. For those new to do-it-yourself web design, managed hosting can simplify the process. Finally, you have to consider the cost. Shared hosting is the most affordable option, with VPS, cloud, and managed all starting around the same price point. Choosing the right hosting plan for your budget is key for do-it-yourself web design projects. We recommend two good providers based on performance, reliability, customer support, and value for the money: SiteGround and Cloudways. SiteGround is known for its fast servers, customer support, and WordPress-specific features. They offer managed hosting plans with automatic updates, daily backups, a CDN, free SSL, and much more, starting at $2.99 monthly for the first year. After that, you’ll pay around $18 monthly, which is still a great deal for everything you’ll get. Get SiteGround Another great option is Cloudways. They offer managed cloud hosting, allowing you to choose from cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google. They provide a user-friendly interface for managing your server and offer features like caching, staging, robust security features, and the ability to scale your server with the click of a button. If you want a host that will grow with you, Cloudways is the perfect option. Get Cloudways Once you’ve settled on hosting, the next step is to choose a theme. WordPress themes dictate your website’s overall look and feel, influencing its design, layout, and functionality. While WordPress offers an extensive library of free themes, we strongly recommend a premium theme, like Divi, as the ultimate solution for do-it-yourself web design. Divi is more than just a theme; it’s a powerful page builder that allows you to create websites without coding. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, the Visual Builder, thousands of pre-designed layouts, and extensive customization options, making it the perfect tool for beginners and do-it-yourself web designers. Divi stands out from other WordPress themes for several reasons. Its Visual Builder lets you see your designs in real time as you create them. Drag one of Divi’s 200+ design modules onto the page, adjust its nearly unlimited customization options, and see the results instantly. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ In addition to building your site with design modules, Divi offers Divi Quick Sites, which allows you to create your site from a collection of pre-made starter sites or through an AI-generated site, thanks to Divi AI. Provide a short description of your site, and Divi will build it in minutes. Every Divi Quick Site has all content, web pages, images, global styles, and a menu. It’s a quick way to create a beautiful website in a short amount of time with limited effort. Divi gives you complete control over every aspect of your site’s design. You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and more. You can also create dynamic templates for your header, footer, blog posts, and more, thanks to Divi’s Theme Builder. This level of customization allows you to create a unique and professional website that reflects your brand, attracts new customers, and encourages them to act. If you plan to sell products and services on your site, you’ll benefit from Divi‘s built-in support for WooCommerce. Divi comes with 20+ Woo modules that allow you to customize every step of the purchase process, from the product to checkout. Combining the power of Visual Builder, Theme Builder, and WooCommerce, you can easily design and build stunning product, shop, and checkout pages. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ By choosing Divi, you’re not just choosing a theme; you’re choosing a complete website-building platform that allows you to create beautiful, functional websites without coding. It’s also one of the most cost-effective solutions you’ll find. For just $89 per year, you can build unlimited Divi websites and manage them through Divi Dash, Divi’s all-in-one site management tool. Divi Dash allows you to manage all your websites, their software, and clients in one convenient location. Get Divi User experience (UX) should be front and center regarding do-it-yourself web design. UX refers to a user’s overall experience while interacting with your website. It involves everything from how easily users can find information to how enjoyable their interactions are. A positive user experience increases engagement, higher conversion rates, and improved customer satisfaction. On the other hand, poor UX can lead to frustration, abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand. Several key factors contribute to a positive UX, so we’ll focus on navigation, mobile responsiveness, and page load speed. Effective navigation is the backbone of a good user experience. It allows users to find what they are looking for easily. Here are some tips for creating clear and intuitive navigation: Mobile users expect a seamless experience on their devices. A responsive website provides just that, making it easy for them to browse your content, navigate your site, and complete desired actions. There are some SEO benefits to responsive design, too. This is because Google uses a mobile-first algorithm that prioritizes mobile-friendly sites when displaying search results. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you are responsible for all aspects of your site. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ As mentioned, using a good WordPress theme like Divi can give you a tremendous edge in this department. Divi is inherently responsive, meaning any website built with it will automatically adapt to different screen sizes. For even more control, you can use the responsive controls built into Divi to make the necessary design tweaks to make it perfect. Ensuring your site loads fast is another key principle of UX design. Slow loading times can lead to frustration, high bounce rates (users leaving your website), and negatively impacting your search engine rankings. To help you keep your site running smoothly, consider using a fast hosting provider like SiteGround. In addition to hosting, there are a few other ways to ensure your site loads quickly for your users, including: While Divi provides the tools to build a website easily, understanding fundamental design principles is crucial for creating a visually appealing and effective website. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you take on the entire design process. Design principles use elements like color, typography, and images to create a cohesive look and feel. Stock photo subscriptions can be expensive. Thankfully, there are several free stock image sites you can use to build your website: Divi AI offers a compelling alternative to traditional stock photo platforms. It can generate unique, custom images based on text prompts. This means you can create images that perfectly match your content and brand without relying on generic stock photos. Divi AI can save you time and money while ensuring your website has relevant images and vectors that engage users. One of the best aspects of Divi AI is that there are no limitations on how many images you can generate. This starkly contrasts with other AI generators that provide a credit-based system for creating images. With Divi AI, you can generate as many as you’d like and never worry about running out of credits. Divi AI is offered as a companion product to Divi. You can sign up for access starting at $16.08 per month. Get Divi AI Regarding do-it-yourself web design, the adage “content is king” remains as true as ever. While a visually appealing site is important for attracting visitors, the content keeps them engaged and coming back for more. High-quality, relevant content is the foundation of a successful website, driving traffic, building domain authority, and achieving your online goals. Here’s why high-quality, relevant content is so important: If you’re looking for an easy way to write SEO-optimized content for your website, Divi AI can help. Divi AI is more than just a website and image generator. It can create content, too, making it a great tool for the do-it-yourself web designer. While it doesn’t replace the need for strategic thinking and human oversight, it can be a powerful tool for streamlining content creation and ensuring basic SEO elements are in place. You can provide Divi AI with text prompts related to a topic, including relevant keywords, the tone of writing you’d like, and even the content length. The AI then generates content based on input, incorporating the keywords you specify throughout the text. Divi AI will create headlines, body copy, product descriptions, and more. Another critical aspect of do-it-yourself web design is learning some basic search engine optimization (SEO). When someone searches for information related to your business or website, SEO helps ensure your site appears as high as possible in the search results. Increased visibility can increase your website’s organic (non-paid) traffic. SEO is important for a few reasons. Aside from increased visibility, SEO helps you attract users actively seeking information or products related to your business. Websites that rank high in search results are perceived as more credible and trustworthy, giving customers peace of mind to interact with or purchase from you. SEO is also a very cost-effective form of marketing. Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cheaper way to drive traffic to your site over the long term. Here are some fundamental practices that every do-it-yourself web designer should understand: Keyword research involves identifying your target audience’s words and phrases when searching for information related to your business. Tools like Semrush, KWFinder, and SE Ranking can help you find relevant keywords. Understanding what people are searching for allows you to tailor and optimize your content to the right people. On-page optimization involves optimizing elements within your website itself. This includes key areas like title tags, meta descriptions, URLs, and content. During your keyword research, you’ll want to select a primary keyword. Opt for relevant keywords with high search volume and aren’t overly competitive. Choosing a highly competitive keyword can cause you to struggle to rank high in search results. Once you’ve selected a relevant keyword, include it throughout your content (page or post). Include it in the page or post’s title, the URL (permalink), and the meta description. A word of caution, though: avoid keyword stuffing. Using your chosen keyword too often throughout your content can lead to poor placement in SERPs, loss of credibility, and poor user experience. Lastly, assign images to your posts and pages, and add alt text. Another effective way to boost your SEO is through link building. This involves acquiring links from other reputable websites and blogs that link to your website. These links act as votes of confidence and can significantly improve your search engine rankings. Building high-quality backlinks requires effort and strategy, focusing on earning links from relevant and authoritative sources. Thorough testing and feedback are critical before launching your new website, especially for do-it-yourself web design. This step helps identify and fix user experience, functionality, or performance issues. Launching a website without testing is like releasing a product without quality control – it can lead to frustration for users, damage your reputation, and limit your site’s success. Testing allows you to catch and resolve potential issues, including: Several tools can help you test your website, including browser developer tools, Google PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix, and more. Most modern web browsers like Chrome and Safari have built-in developer tools to help you test responsiveness, spy console errors, and performance. Similarly, tools like Google’s Mobile Friendly test check your site for responsiveness and recommend improvements. Finally, you can use Google Page Speed Insights, GTMetrix, or Pingdom to analyze your website’s performance and provide detailed reports on page load speed and other core web vitals. These tools are invaluable resources for anyone engaged in do-it-yourself web design. Another important part of the testing process is to gather feedback about your website. Ask friends, family, or colleagues to test your website and provide honest feedback. Remember that most of your friends/family will need guidance on what to look for, so provide them with a list of questions to answer. Start with simple questions: Encourage them to be as specific as possible when answering. After all, their perspective can help you identify issues you might have overlooked. Creating a website has never been easier or more rewarding. It’s a chance to express your creativity and gain valuable new skills. From initial planning and choosing the right platform to focusing on user experience (UX) and search engine optimization (SEO), you have access to everything you need to build a strong online presence. Powerful tools like the Divi theme and its innovative AI companion, Divi AI, empower anyone to create professional websites with stunning visuals and SEO-friendly content. With these strategies and resources, you can successfully embrace do-it-yourself web design and quickly build your website. Explore plans, pricing and features.

Title: 6 Foods You Should Be Buying in Bulk, According to an Expert

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Rigetti Computing (RGTI, Financial) shares shot 48% higher on Tuesday after B. Riley reaffirmed the 'Buy' rating and raised the price target to $8.50 from $4.00. It comes on the heels of the company's renewed hopes of commercializing the quantum computing sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Those gains illustrate investor confidence in Rigetti's both intermediate and long-term potential, even given recent market volatility driven by comments from Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) CEO Jensen Huang about the 'very useful' prospects for quantum computers. Regarding Rigetti, "the key driver here is that they have overlooked technical things that are really important," said Craig Ellis of B. Riley, an analyst who cited the scalability of quantum systems for high-value workloads that simply aren't accessible by traditional technologies. Ellis noted that Rigetti's equity capital raises in the fourth quarter of 2024 clearly alleviated prior cash sufficiency concerns, allaying a huge hurdle for the company's growth. Rigetti's investment appeal was also strengthened by his highlighting the company's position as a could-be leader in government-related quantum computing adoption. The analyst acknowledged technical scale-up hurdles and long delays to profitability and countered that rising interest in so-called frontier technologies beyond artificial intelligence could drive up Rigetti's growth. We also pointed to key factors to watch in the years ahead, which included the maturing of the quantum ecosystem and more commercial engagement. Rigetti's strong showing comes as broader quantum computing stocks rebound from a period of under pressure over the past few years. This progress could put the company in a strong position to become a key player in the fast-developing quantum world. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

US stock futures inched higher on Wednesday ahead of crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets, while investors waited to find out whether big bank earnings will live up to high hopes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose roughly 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) nudged 0.1% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) added about 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. The markets are bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool. It will be a crucial test of whether an inflation resurgence is a risk to the US economy as investors debate the Federal Reserve's moves on interest rates in 2025. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Traders now see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June hovering around 40%. The CPI report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show annual headline inflation at 2.9% and a monthly rate of 0.4%, up from November's levels. A strong reading could restart the selling in stocks and bonds that has marked the start of 2025. Meanwhile, investors are also waiting for quarterly reports from big Wall Street banks to kick off earnings season. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country’s largest bank, is expected to report that it notched its second straight year of record profits and show that earnings in the fourth quarter jumped. Updates from BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also on the docket.

Title: Morgan Stanley: “[TSMC’s] Customers Like AMD And Broadcom Are Releasing CoWoS-S Capacity Due To Weaker Demand,” Allowing NVIDIA To “Convert This Capacity To CoWoS-L For GB300A Production”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few days, the proverbial waters have become quite murky due to the lack of visibility over TSMC's supposed travails related to its bespoke wafer-level system integration platform, CoWoS. Now, however, analysts at Morgan Stanley have stepped up to offer some much-needed clarity on this topic and its implications, if any, on NVIDIA's product roll out. As per a recent report by The Information, NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers purportedly continue to face overheating and glitching issues, apparently prompting the chipmaker's mega customers, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, to pare their respective Blackwell orders. The report went on to note that Blackwell's woes stem from the "way [those] chips connect," alluding to a possible flaw within TSMC's bespoke advanced packaging solution, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), which enables the integration of multiple chips into a single package. This report struck a nerve with investors, especially as NVIDIA had declared back in 2024 that it was able to rectify Blackwell's performance-related teething issues by implementing minor changes to the photomask, a specific template that is used to create patterns on chip wafers. However, soon after, DigiTimes calmed perturbed investors by leveraging its internal sources within TSMC to report that, contrary to The Information's report, TSMC has "maintained" its existing Blackwell orders, negating the rumored decrease in orders from NVIDIA's mega customers. Morgan Stanley’s view on TSMC’s CoWoS order fluctuations highlights that some customers, like $AMD and Broadcom, are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand. $NVDA, however, has stepped in and requested $TSM to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.… https://t.co/jneCfh0goi — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 15, 2025 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh note, shedding some much-needed additional light on this topic. According to the Wall Street titan, some TSMC customers, including AMD and Broadcom, "are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand." This aligns with a separate note penned by Nomura, which notes that NVIDIA "could slash CoWoS-S orders from TSMC and UMC by up to 80% in 2025 due to weaker demand for Hopper platform chips." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's Hopper chips utilize TSMC's CoWoS-S tech while the newer Blackwell chips leverage the global chip fabrication giant's CoWoS-L packaging tech. Coming back, Morgan Stanley then goes on to note that, in light of CoWoS-S capacity cancelations, NVIDIA "has stepped in and requested TSMC to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production." Morgan Stanley also declares: "Despite these shifts, TSMC’s overall CoWoS demand remains steady, with a slight potential increase in GB300A production later this year." This means that The Information's report might have been partially correct: there have been order cancelations at TSMC. However, as clarified by Morgan Stanley, the cancelations only affect orders that leverage TSMC’s CoWoS-S packaging technology and that NVIDIA's Blackwell orders likely remain unaffected.

Title: Hold onto your current job if you want to keep working remotely
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-hybrid-work-from-home-jobs-persisting-fewer-new-roles-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-15T09:15:02Z

Americans who want to keep their work-from-home arrangements may need to cling to their jobs. Corporate giants like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan have notified employees they must return to the office five days a week this year. This comes as the share of remote and hybrid postings on job platforms has ticked down in recent years — which has made landing one of these roles more difficult. As of November, the share of postings on Indeed for remote and hybrid jobs had declined to 7.8% from over 10% in 2022, according to the platform's data. On LinkedIn, the share of remote or hybrid postings had declined to roughly 21% as of December, down from 26% two years prior. But remote and hybrid jobs haven't faded away. In December, roughly 23% of US workers worked from home at least part of the time, up from about 19% two years prior, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, about 10% worked completely from home. "We keep hearing stories that 'work from home is over,' and while, yes, it is true for some firms, others must be doing the reverse," Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist and cofounder of the remote-work-research website WFH Research, told Business Insider. Bloom's research has found that the share of paid full days worked from home in the US has been fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bloom and other economists told BI that the divide between remote or hybrid job postings and work-from-home rates suggested that some employers could be prioritizing in-person hires while letting some of their existing employees continue working more flexibly. They said this strategy could allow companies to boost their in-office attendance without drawing the ire of employees who've grown used to a remote or hybrid arrangement. "We know that companies frequently make exceptions to return-to-office mandates for employees to avoid losing them, so policy changes might affect new hires more than incumbent employees," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told BI. This approach would allow workers to retain their flexible work arrangements — but make it more difficult for them to snag a remote or hybrid role at another company, Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn's Economic Graph Research Institute, told BI. "If you already have a job and you are grandfathered into this flexible work, you're maintaining it in a lot of cases," Kantenga said. "Companies are using those new positions to roll that flexible work back a little bit, but they're not necessarily rolling it back for the workers who already have it." Even if more businesses prioritize in-person hiring, it could take awhile for work-from-home rates to fall significantly, Lisa Simon, the chief economist at Revelio Labs, said. That's because hiring, layoffs, and resignations have slowed, which means that "very few people have actually changed jobs in the last two years" and businesses haven't added many new workers who would be subject to recent RTO mandates, Simon told BI. However, the modest share of available remote or hybrid jobs could be somewhat misleading. Simon said that a slowdown in hiring for white-collar roles — where flexible working arrangements are more common — could be pushing down remote and hybrid job postings. Additionally, Bloom said some companies might not want to commit to a flexible working arrangement in the job posting but could ultimately allow the employee to work from home at least some of the time. "They don't want to repeat the 2021 mistake of promising generous work from home only to have to painfully reverse this later," he said. Bloom added that for some roles — like university professors — working from home on days when they don't have classes is a norm of the job. However, a job posting might not classify this position as remote or hybrid. Pollak said remote and hybrid roles are generally underrepresented in job postings because they tend to have lower turnover than the typical in-person job. "A hotel may replace its entire staff of janitors three times a year but only replace its remote customer-support staff every two years," she said.

Title: Washington Post in CRISIS: Resignations, retrenchment and revenue slump

The Washington Post (WaPo) suffered a $100 million revenue loss in 2024, primarily due to a massive decline in digital readership, dropping from 22.5 million daily users to just 2.5 to three million. In response to financial struggles, WaPo laid off approximately 100 employees. The paper also experienced significant staff resignations, including high-profile editors and columnists, following the decision not to endorse Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. The publication's credibility and influence have been severely eroded by internal conflicts over editorial decisions such as not endorsing Harris, which led to a loss of 250,000 paid subscribers. Bezos's decision not to endorse Harris, which he defended in an op-ed, sparked a significant exodus of long-time staffers further damaging the publication's reputation and newsroom. WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability.

WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability. The Washington Post (WaPo), once a bastion of American journalism, finds itself in a state of unprecedented decline as it grapples with a staggering $100 million revenue loss in 2024 and a near-collapse of its digital readership. WaPo's struggles are emblematic of a publication caught between shifting political tides and internal turmoil. During the peak of the 2024 presidential election, the newspaper's website averaged just 2.5 million to three million daily visitors â a stark contrast to the 22.5 million daily users it boasted at the start of the Biden administration. This 87 percent decline in digital traffic has had a devastating impact on the paper's bottom line, with subscription and ad revenue plummeting by $100 million in 2024 alone. The resulting loss of revenue has forced WaPo to lay off roughly 100 employees this month, marking yet another chapter in its ongoing financial and editorial crisis. The layoffs impacted about four percent of the publication's workforce and primarily targeted business divisions. (Related: Washington Post to lay off nearly 100 employees in latest round of cuts.) A WaPo spokesperson said the publication "is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." They added: "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The paper's woes were further compounded when it lost 250,000 paid subscribers in a single blow after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intervened to block an endorsement of outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. The decision not to endorse Harris, a move that broke with decades of tradition, sparked a wave of resignations and internal dissent. Bezos defended his decision not to endorse the Democrat in an October op-ed, writing that "presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election." Later, the Amazon founder insisted that his refusal to back Harris "was the right decision" he was "proud" to have chosen. WaPo faces credibility crisis with staff resignations While Bezos defended his decision not to endorse Harris, the WaPo newsroom did not take too kindly to it. Many longtime staffers left the paper including Robert Kagan, the paper's editor-at-large. Kagan, the husband of former Department of State official Victoria Nuland, stepped down in October. Several staffers followed suit and handed in their resignation letters. Managing editor Matea Gold and reporters Josh Dawsey, Michael Scherer, Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager jumped ship and joined other mainstream media publications. WaPo was also rocked by two resignations this month. Columnist Jennifer Rubin announced her exit just days before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, lambasting the paper for failing to uphold its journalistic mission. "Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy â Donald Trump â at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracyâs survival and capacity to thrive," Rubin wrote in her resignation letter. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned after WaPo refused to publish her satirical cartoon depicting Bezos and other Big Tech figures groveling before Trump. These departures have left the publication's newsroom and editorial sections severely depleted, further eroding its credibility and influence. WaPo's decline is a cautionary tale for legacy media outlets navigating an increasingly polarized and fragmented media landscape. Once a symbol of journalistic excellence, the paper now struggles to retain readers, revenue, and relevance. Its slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness," rings hollow as WaPo itself teeters on the brink of irrelevance. Whether Bezos can steer the publication back to stability or whether it will continue its downward spiral remains an open question. For now, WaPo's future looks as uncertain as the democracy it claims to defend.

Corporate media lays off hundreds of journalists and employees. Sources include: TheNationalPulse.com FoxNews.com MSN.com Brighteon.com WaPo's struggles are emblematic of a publication caught between shifting political tides and internal turmoil. During the peak of the 2024 presidential election, the newspaper's website averaged just 2.5 million to three million daily visitors â a stark contrast to the 22.5 million daily users it boasted at the start of the Biden administration. This 87 percent decline in digital traffic has had a devastating impact on the paper's bottom line, with subscription and ad revenue plummeting by $100 million in 2024 alone. The resulting loss of revenue has forced WaPo to lay off roughly 100 employees this month, marking yet another chapter in its ongoing financial and editorial crisis. The layoffs impacted about four percent of the publication's workforce and primarily targeted business divisions. (Related: Washington Post to lay off nearly 100 employees in latest round of cuts.)

January 14, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

Read more Gold prices steadied in yesterday’s session, as market participants digested latest US inflation data as well as a report on President-elect Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs. US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today. Updates regarding a ceasefire deal yesterday between Israel and Hamas capped some gains for precious metal, any further updates on the same could weigh on prices. Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 9.33.07 AM.jpeg The Nifty’s bounce yesterday has created a “bullish harami” formation given the Monday drop which is similar to what was seen on January 7 and means that bulls have to push the index through 23340 for a larger advance. The 17th to 23rd January time window is nearing, so support in the 22830 - 23000 area and resistance in the 23355 - 23470 zone will be watched closely. While our prop oscillators on the daily and the weekly continue to be bearish, the former has now entered oversold territory. Any extension of yesterday’s rebound needs to hold the Monday low of 23047.

This measure follows reduced Russian aluminium imports, which fell to 6% of total EU aluminium demand in 2024. While U.S. and UK bans have intensified the supply shift, the EU seeks alternatives from Middle Eastern producers like the UAE and Bahrain. The news initially pushed LME aluminium prices to a one-month high of $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50, reflecting market uncertainties. * AARTIIND * ANGELONE * BANDHANBANK * HINDCOPPER * LTFIN * RBLBANK Optiemus: Company partners Taiwan-based KunWay Technology to Drive Drone Manufacturing Localization in India.

In the US, Producer prices increased 0.2% mom (+3.3% YoY) in Dec-24, below 0.4% in November which was the biggest gain in five months, and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.4% YoY). Meanwhile, the core PPI was unchanged, following a 0.2% rise (+3.5%YoY) in Nov and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.8%YoY). On the fiscal front in the U.S. government posted an $87 billion budget deficit in December, reduced partly by a shift of benefit payments into November but capping a record $711 billion deficit for the first three months of the 2025 fiscal year, On the domestic front, India’s wholesale prices increased by 2.37% yoy in December 2024, accelerating from a 1.89% rise in November, slightly above forecasts of a 2.30% gain. This was due to faster rises in manufacturing prices amid a softer fall in fuel prices. Primary articles saw faster growth (6.02% vs 5.49% in Nov), and manufacturing prices accelerated to a 23-month high (2.14% vs 2.00%). In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said. The government may also raise the allocation for production-linked incentives for the textile sector to around 600 million rupees from 450 million rupees for the current fiscal year, the source said. Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY). NFO Period: 16th January –30th January, 2025 Bengaluru, January 14, 2025: Groww Mutual Fund has introduced the Groww Nifty India Railways PSU ETF, aiming to offer retail investors the opportunity to invest in the Indian Railways ecosystem, a fundamental pillar of India’s infrastructure. The NFO period of the scheme is from 16-30 January, 2025 This ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Nifty India Railways PSU Index -TRI, comprising Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) essential to the railways sector, spanning infrastructure, financial services, logistics, and technology. Capitalizing on India’s Growth Story* Indian Railways is critical to the country’s transportation and logistics ecosystem, with a vast network spanning 68,584 km and over 7,325 stations. It facilitates seamless transportation for 6.7 billion passengers annually—equivalent to the world’s population—and handles 27% of India’s freight movement. The sector is undergoing a significant transformation, supported by a record ₹2.52 lakh crore in government capital expenditure for FY 2024-25. Initiatives include the transition to safer, more efficient rolling stock, station upgrades, high-speed rail projects, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions like solar installations, aligning with sustainability goals while reducing operational costs. In adherence to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, Punjab National Bank (PNB), nation’s leading public sector bank, urges its customers to update their “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information by 23.01.2025 to ensure smooth functioning of their accounts. This is applicable only for those customers whose accounts were due for KYC updation as of 30.09.2024. As part of the KYC compliance exercise, PNB customers are requested to provide their updated information like identity proof, address proof, recent photo, PAN/Form 60, income proof, mobile number (if not available) or any other KYC information at any branch. It can also be done through PNB ONE/Internet Banking Services (IBS) or registered e-mail/post to their base branch by 23.01.2025. Failure to update KYC details within the stipulated time may result in restrictions on account operations. “The WPI inflation expectedly rose to 2.4% in December 2024 from 1.9% in November 2024, while printing slightly lower than ICRA’s estimate (+2.6%). The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

Today's revolutions in mobile computing get all the glory, but the best desktop PCs endure. Whether for high-powered gaming, rendering complex 3D scenes, or crunching data-drenched spreadsheets, the best desktops still do it better. At PCMag, we've tested thousands of desktops since our beginnings in 1982, and our analysts and editors represent more than a century of experience in desktop testing and reviews. We use standardized methodologies to measure CPU and graphics performance against relevant comparison PCs and assess all models on design, usability, upgradability, connectivity, and more. Our reviews encompass business PCs and workstations, gaming PCs, all-in-ones, and even mini PCs. Our current pick for the best mainstream desktop PC for most people is the 2024 Dell XPS Desktop for its budget-to-high-end configurations and expansive, high-style case. Below, see the rest of our always-shifting recommendations, followed by a deep-dive buying guide on everything to factor into your desktop purchase. With the highly versatile XPS Desktop 8960 for 2024, Dell remains a top dog of desktops. Dell configured our review unit as a high-end tower with lots of graphics oomph, which ripped through just about every benchmark we put it through. With an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card inside, it's also ready to ramp up for game time. However, we also picked it for its versatility in configurations. Starting at just $800, this desktop shows impressive range in the kinds of customers it can serve. If you desire a high-end desktop for more than gaming, stop looking: The latest Dell XPS Desktop is here. Not only is it ready for just about any task you can throw its way, but Dell's XPS Desktop case also leaves room for a decent amount of upgrades and an ample port selection. It's also available in far more affordable configurations, opening this product up to aspirational upgraders who want to start small. What is the price of the Dell XPS Desktop 8960 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Acer has developed a bit of a value dynasty for itself, with the previous title holder's direct successor now atop our list as the best desktop for most people. The Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 takes what the 1760 model accomplished and levels it up with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor inside paired with 8GB of memory and the same 512GB SSD capacity. With the Aspire TC-1780-UA92, Acer stands above every budget tower we’ve tested since. Its sub-$600 starting price nets you plenty of power, space for upgrades, and modern amenities like a front USB-C port and card reader, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, and dual HDMI ports for two monitors. Yet again, anyone seeking the best PC for their family or household with a tight budget will be served well by this Acer model. Its value-oriented array of components continues to be better than what we see from most budget PCs, and it includes features found in high-end machines not too long ago. Expect this Acer tower to be a reliable daily driver for years after purchase. What is the price of the Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? MSI handily took the budget gaming rig crown with its Codex R2 model, a sub-$1,000 desktop with modern features, competent performance, and lots of room for expansion. The Codex nails all of the criteria we value in entry-level gaming PCs, particularly allowing you to invest in the product down the line with upgrades to core components like the CPU and GPU in addition to memory and storage. It's also competitively priced for the hardware it houses, able to serve up 1440p performance for less than a grand. Budget-bound PC gamers who don't want to sacrifice performance and get more out of their new gaming desktop than their 1080p or 4K console setup can muster should seriously consider the MSI Codex R2. This is one of the most affordable entries into 1440p gaming that we've seen, making it an instant recommendation for frugal buyers. What is the price of the MSI Codex R2 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Known primarily for its high-performance components and gaming PC cases, Corsair's years-old foray into complete systems has resulted in one of the best PCs we've seen for compact gaming. Don't be fooled by this diminutive desktop's dashing wood-paneled design: The Corsair One i500 packs an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU that topped our benchmark charts, thanks in no small part to its high-efficiency, liquid-cooled parts inside. Plus, the One i500's components are all upgradable despite its small frame, even the GPU, though you'll need to mail in the tower for that. To get so much power out of such a space-friendly design, we think that once-a-generation process is worth it when the RTX 4090 eventually gets surpassed. Anyone looking for the best desktop for compact gaming and having the cash to make their dream come true should consider the Corsair One i500 before looking further. If you don't like the wood paneling, Corsair sells a metal-paneled version to match your aesthetic. Also, despite this PC clearing $3,000, you might be shocked to learn it's better-priced than most gaming rigs housing an RTX 4090. What is the price of the Corsair One i500 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Skipping the M3 generation of processors proved well worth it for Apple's miniature Mac. The latest Mac mini takes on Apple's M4 processors to incredible effect, particularly in the M4 Pro we tested for our review. The M4 Pro Mac mini blew away like-configured mini desktops and challenged workstations several times its size in some tests. This is before even getting to Apple's redesign, which introduced more ports and better cooling. Whether at its starting budget-priced configuration or tricked out to get serious work done, the new Mac mini is a no-brainer. What's so impressive about the new Mac mini is its ability to serve widely different audiences. It's one of the best budget desktops, starting at just $599 with the M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. At $1,399, it becomes a pint-size M4 Pro powerhouse ready to compete with legitimate workstations. You don't see that kind of value versatility in most desktops. What is the price of the Apple Mac Mini M4 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Versatility is king when recommending a PC to all sorts of general users, and it doesn't get much more adaptable in the desktop space than the HP Envy Move. This all-in-one is designed to move around the home, with a lightweight design that includes a handle and self-deploying feet. It can be used in any room as needed with relative ease, thanks to the included keyboard with a built-in touchpad, and even an internal battery for a few hours off the charger. The Move includes a capable 13th Gen Intel processor, a bright 23.8-inch 1440p display, and a decent webcam, so as to not diminish its capacity as a normal desktop. The reasonable pricing helps, too. If you're a casual, everyday user looking for an all-in-one desktop, you should be happy with this one. For those of you who may not make extensive use of the mobility, we'd still recommend it as an effective general-use AIO. For those who may want to move it around the house or office, it's painless to do so, and various family members can enjoy it for a range of tasks. Just note that the performance doesn't hit the higher end of some more potent AIOs, if that's what you need. What is the price of the HP Envy Move in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? You won't find a huge swath of business-focused AIOs, but HP's EliteOne 870 G9 is the best in class right now. Its sharp professional design and quiet operation are an ideal fit for an office, while its excellent performance and clear webcam can produce what you need to work effectively. Its speakers are loud, and the base stand features wireless charging, as a bonus. A hearty collection of ports rounds out this well-balanced machine. AIOs are not always the most cost-effective solution versus more traditional PCs, so from that perspective, you may consider towers and standalone monitors for fleet deployment. You can service the tower separately from the monitor, should one go bad, while everything is tied together here. If this design still makes more sense for your business, though, the included 1080p webcam is a big plus for home or office workers, as is the support for Windows Hello logins. What is the price of the HP EliteOne 870 G9 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Asus' NUC 14 Pro is the best current mini PC overall, carrying Intel's NUC torch into the future. This mighty little puck is ready for desks at home or in the office, with specific models featuring an Intel Core Ultra chip with vPro security for added peace of mind. With a comprehensive set of options for connectivity and upgradability, not to mention mounting hardware for stowing behind a monitor, this NUC revival is the most impressive mini PC we've reviewed in some time. This next NUC fits for anyone looking to fill a home office or cubicle with a tiny but punchy PC that can drive through basic productivity work. If you're seeking a PC that can disappear easily into a desk setup and accept upgrades to maximize its effective life, seriously consider the Asus NUC 14 Pro. What is the price of the Asus NUC 14 Pro in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? While we tested it at a much more potent configuration, Dell's Precision 3680 starts at a much more approachable price. This is an incredibly scalable workstation since its case needs to accommodate all of those possible levels of performance, and it features options for error-correcting-code (ECC) memory, which is essential for work in industrial control applications, critical databases, and infrastructural memory caches where data errors can be much more dire. What makes the Precision 3680 so easy to recommend is that it's applicable to many tiers of professional computing work, from an entry-level workstation to a top-tier tower of power ready to churn intense rendering and AI workloads. This desktop's effectiveness and value depend significantly on how you configure it for your computing needs before checkout, which puts a lot of power in your hands. What is the price of the Dell Precision 3680 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? This is one of the most potent mini desktop workstations we've tested, with impressive performance from a 3.9-liter chassis. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF got on this list by achieving the diminutive size we look for from mini PCs without compromising too much on speed. Given the desktop's small size, we also appreciate the antenna-free Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios. This desktop also starts at less than $1,000 and can scale up far past what our review configuration provides—a major plus. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF is another highly scalable workstation, though it's a much tighter affair inside. You could upgrade this desktop for at least another generation. ECC memory helps future-proof the system and makes it capable of working in industries with zero tolerance for data corruption. What is the price of the Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? To help you make the best decision in your search for the best desktop, we've gathered a list of the most frequently asked questions surrounding the topic, as well as a few more unsolicited but helpful facts to inform your choice. Below that, you'll find a condensed list of the above recommendations for easier spec comparisons. We've reviewed an impressive variety of the best desktops above, right? We don't deny that a laptop or tablet is a better pick for people who depend on business travel or whose computing consists mostly of basic surfing and typing from the living-room couch. But desktops are often the best choice and the best value for small offices, families, creative pros, gamers, and tech tinkerers. While the best desktops don't come in as many distinct form factors as laptops, you'll find lots of variation in computing power and room for upgrades and expansion. The key is to spend as little as possible to get exactly what you want or need out of your next desktop computer, whether that's a suitable budget buy or a high-power PC with a price tag to match. Reliability is a nebulous concept when it comes to computers: It could mean consistency of performance, or it could also mean the strength and support of its warranty, just to name two interpretations. Certain brands have developed reputations for reliability, namely computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. But no single brand can lay a blanket claim to any such title. Since that might not be the most satisfying answer to such a question, we also have our Readers’ Choice coverage of the desktops category, which polls readers like you to determine widely held opinions on the various desktop options out there. Once you have winnowed down models based on other, more solid criteria, the wisdom of the crowd might help you develop an idea of the most reliable brands to count on in your search for the best PC for you. One of the best desktops' most alluring promises is the value they deliver. With desktop PCs and their components, your money simply goes further. Instead of buying a $700 laptop with a competent Intel Core i5 or Ultra 5 processor, you can get a $700 desktop with a more powerful Core i7 or Ultra 7 CPU and maybe even a dedicated graphics card. You can find complete mini PCs for super light work and display-signage tasks for less than $400 and perfectly serviceable small towers for $300 to $600. Gaming desktops with dedicated graphics cards start at around $700. You can also find all-in-one desktops, with the display and all of the computing components built into a single device, starting at around $400. The thing with desktops is that opting for a cheap one does not carry some of the same risks you'd face with a like-priced laptop. A $250 Black Friday special or a steeply discounted refurbished desktop could perform just fine for basic computing, and you wouldn't need to worry about the wear and tear on cheap materials that you might with a laptop of a similar price. That inexpensive laptop would be subject to the vagaries of daily commuting and the occasional drop from a coffee table. The desktop, in contrast, would need to stay put and just work. At the top end of the market are business workstations, tricked-out gaming rigs, and magnificently engineered all-in-one PCs that cost several thousand dollars. Not only will a $3,000 gaming tower provide immense computing power today, but it should come with so much room for expansion and potential for upgradability that its useful life will be far longer than any laptop. And that's before you even delve into the wild world of custom PCs: automotive-grade paint jobs, liquid cooling, and fanciful lighting and wiring. IT-manageable, security-conscious business desktops—most of them nowadays made by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own pricing dynamic and tend to cost more, all else being equal. That's because of their premium warranty or support plans, as well as the possible addition of enterprise-specific silicon focused on manageability or security. Sometimes, part of the cost premium of business desktops reflects the PC maker’s guarantee that it will stock replacement components and upgrades for that line of machines for a fixed future period. That allows IT pros to count on the ability to continue servicing a fleet of a given business machine over that period. The Mac versus PC debate is one of the oldest in modern technology, and we're not going to pick a side or try to settle that particular religious war here. But if you're not wedded to one or the other by years of habit (or the peripherals and software you own) and are open to switching, here's a quick rundown of your choices. Windows 11 is the latest iteration of Microsoft's operating system. Most people typically rely on desktops that use it and previous versions of the OS, so you'll be assured of the best compatibility and the widest selection of third-party software. Desktops running Windows are also readily available below $500, making them attractive to casual users, families looking for a second PC, and bargain hunters. Macs are an excellent choice if you're already in an Apple-centric household since macOS is seamlessly compatible with iPads and iPhones. You can also send and receive messages on any device connected to your iCloud account. However, the cost of entry will be higher than with the least expensive PCs. Google's ChromeOS is a viable alternative to Windows and macOS, but desktops running it (called Chromeboxes) are rare and best suited to niche uses like powering a restaurant menu display. A fourth option is to buy a desktop with no operating system at all and install an open-source one of your choosing, such as Ubuntu Linux. We don't recommend going this route unless you're technically savvy, willing to experiment, and OK with fixing software compatibility issues and other quirks. Macs and Windows PCs are available in all three of the major desktop form factors: mini PCs that can fit on a bookshelf, sleek all-in-ones with built-in (and usually high-resolution) displays, and traditional desktop towers that are bulky but have room for more expansion. These three forms each have strengths and weaknesses, and none of them is an obvious best choice for everyone. You'll have to choose based on what you plan to do with your desktop and where you plan to put it. For truly cramped quarters, light workloads, and people who love the efficient use of space, a mini PC could be the best choice. They come in sizes ranging from tiny sticks not much larger than a USB thumb drive to small-form-factor (SFF) towers that may be nearly a foot tall but have compact footprints. The smallest sizes have the benefit of disappearing behind an HDMI-equipped monitor or TV, and they contain a processor, memory, storage, and ports to hook up keyboards and mice. They're economical and power-efficient, and they can serve as adequate web browsing or multimedia viewing platforms. But know that the models at the truly tiny end of the scale have no room for adding extra internal components, and their preinstalled parts are usually difficult or impossible to upgrade. Regardless, you can find a fair mix of what qualifies as mini PCs that can be customized or upgraded with better components. They're bigger than the "stick"-style PCs but much more flexible and expandable. Traditional tower desktops are capable of even more flexibility but also bring a lot more bulk. Nowadays, the differences between midsize and full-size towers are less well-defined, and some of the new PC case designs—from cubes to glass boxes—defy easy categorization. Still, nearly all desktop towers have generous amounts of interior space and full-size (a.k.a. ATX) motherboards, so you can install one or more (sometimes, many more) secondary storage drives, more RAM in empty slots on the motherboard, a video card if one isn't installed, and in some remote cases, even a second graphics card for extreme gaming or graphics-accelerated tasks. (Note that not all desktop mini towers and towers can take a graphics upgrade. That is where reviews come in.) An all-in-one (AIO) desktop is quite a different animal from both of these form factors. An AIO can save you some space since the display is built in. An AIO's value proposition comes down to space saving and whether you are shopping for a desktop display simultaneously. Though you can find budget AIOs with basic feature sets, lower resolutions, and non-touch screens, many new models include touch-enabled screens, and some AIO panels have exceptionally high native resolutions of 4K (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) or even 5K (5,120 by 2,880 pixels). Touch displays make them excellent choices for watching movies or serving as a multimedia hub in the kitchen or other public areas of your home, though the absolute highest resolutions target content creators rather than consumers. With a few exceptions for business-oriented models, you will give up a lot of room for expansion in an AIO versus a traditional desktop tower. Cracking open an AIO for an upgrade or fix, while not impossible, is a bigger deal than opening the side of a desktop tower. Apple's recent iMacs are particularly difficult to open. One of the main benefits of a desktop tower is that it will use a desktop-grade CPU. That may sound obvious, but it's a key distinction. AMD and Intel, the two biggest makers of PC processors, provide desktop-class and laptop-class chips to system manufacturers, but often, the CPU model names are similar and tricky to tell apart. For example, you will see Intel's Core i7 in laptops and desktops, but having a "true" desktop CPU versus one made for a mobile device makes a big performance difference. A desktop CPU gives you more power for complex content-creation work, PC gaming, or math and scientific projects. Faster processors with four, six, eight, or even as many as 18 cores will benefit software written to take advantage of the extra cores. The desktop version of a given CPU will consume more power and generate more heat than versions designed for laptops, which must be incorporated into environments that have less thermal and power-delivery leeway. A desktop CPU also has greater wiggle room to incorporate a key feature, multithreading, that allows each of the CPU's cores to address two processing threads at a time instead of just one. When engaged with suitably equipped software, multithreading (which Intel calls "Hyper-Threading") can deliver a major performance boost. The best desktop chips may require liquid cooling systems, limiting their use to high-end towers with lots of interior space. Processors in these families are specialized and expensive, and you’ll only want them if you have specific software needs that you know, explicitly, can leverage their higher base and peak clock rates, as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not casual purchases. Conversely, many AIOs and mini PCs use the same efficient, cooler-running types of CPUs that you'll find in laptops. Intel typically labels these mobile-first chip designs with a CPU name containing "U" or "H," whereas most desktop chips instead have a "T" or a "K" or just a zero at the end. A mobile CPU might have the same number of processor cores as its desktop counterpart (four- and six-core chips are common in both), but its maximum power consumption will often be far lower. Also, the typical base and boost clock speeds may be lower, and the chip may not support multithreading. Regardless, many desktop PC buyers will be fine with these lower-powered CPUs for everyday work and a little more. For a typical tower using a true desktop-grade CPU, mainstream users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful choices, but overkill for most folks who aren’t serious PC gamers, intense multitaskers, or prosumer video or image manipulators. If CPU power is critically important, though, these should suffice. The Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series are worthwhile only if you know too few cores or threads are holding back your workflow, or you have extreme needs in terms of internal storage (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources). Again, see our deep dive on desktop CPUs to understand the nuances of these higher-end choices. Look out for Intel "Arrow Lake" Core Ultra processors to start hitting desktops soon after their launch in late 2024. These are the first Intel desktop chips with neural processing units for dedicating AI crunching. All computers have a CPU, but most laptops and many cheaper desktops don't have a dedicated graphics processor or GPU. Instead, their display output comes from a portion of the CPU, a slice of silicon known as an integrated graphics processor (IGP). An IGP is fine for basic tasks, such as checking your email, browsing the web, or even streaming videos. Doing productivity work on an IGP is completely within bounds. Indeed, most business desktops rely on IGPs. In any case, an IGP is not the answer for anyone who wants to run intensive 3D games, render architectural simulations, or perhaps train an artificial intelligence algorithm. These situations—especially games, but often pro-grade apps, too—can benefit from more muscular graphics. Times like these call for a graphics card, which will bring its own GPU to the game, and the most powerful of these are found in the best PCs for gaming. Choosing a graphics card is a complex affair. Gamers should consider the capabilities of their monitor first. A 4K monitor or one with a high refresh rate (144Hz or greater) will require a profoundly powerful GPU (or occasionally even two GPUs) to display games at the monitor's maximum potential. If you're just looking to do some middle-of-the-road gaming on a 1080p monitor (and not looking to win any professional esports crowns), a mainstream card will do just fine. Meanwhile, creative professionals and other power users should consider the graphics-acceleration recommendations of the apps they plan to run, using the software maker's system requirements as a guide. Graphics-accelerated video rendering or AI programs can benefit from the same types of GPUs as intensive 3D games. Professionals eyeing workstations will want to consider Nvidia's RTX A series lineup or AMD's Radeon Pro models. Check out our deep-dive guide to graphics cards for much more on the nuances of today's video cards. While powerful CPUs and GPUs are mostly relegated to desktop towers, nearly every desktop form factor can handle copious amounts of storage and memory. This is thanks to the advent of higher-capacity memory modules, especially solid-state drives (SSDs). The latter take up vastly less space than the spinning hard drives of old. It's still possible to find desktops with only spinning hard drives, but we recommend avoiding these and choosing an SSD as the main boot drive whenever possible. Some desktops feature a single-drive combination of an SSD and a hard drive. A "true" SSD is the only way to go as a boot drive today, though, considering how far prices have dropped in the last couple of years. A single 500GB or 512GB SSD is fine for most users. A 250GB or 256GB SSD is also a common size for a boot drive these days, but it's a little tight if you store much locally. Anyone with large media and game collections will want to consider several terabytes of storage across multiple drives. Consider choosing a fast SSD as the boot drive and one or more large-capacity but slower hard drives for bulk storage of capacity-sapping video or games. A typical configuration in this case is one 512GB SSD and one or more hard drives with at least 1TB of space on each. Such a setup can be more affordable than you might think—an SSD plus one hard drive is sometimes seen on under-$1,000 desktop towers. If you think you'll add storage later, consider how many expansion bays your desktop has. A combination of two or more 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch bays should be enough, as these can accommodate any type of traditional SSD or hard drive. You'll also want to ensure your desktop has at least one M.2 slot to accept a PCI Express SSD as the main boot drive since that will enable the fastest throughput speeds. The boot drive will come as an M.2 drive in most new systems. These drives are quite small, the size and thickness of a stick of gum. While a desktop's SSD stores your data, its system memory (or RAM) works with the CPU to run apps and helps define its capacity to multitask. Memory capacities of 8GB or 16GB are fine for most users, and these are the most common configurations on entry-level or midrange desktops of all forms and sizes. Few people will see much benefit from memory amounts above 16GB, but you'll find exceptions. Gaming PCs above the budget level should have at least 16GB of RAM, and 32GB is a prudent upgrade for esports hounds who want to play and simultaneously edit and stream in-game footage. Finally, assuming your professional software can address higher memory amounts, professional workstations should have at least 32GB of memory with error-correcting code (ECC) capabilities to keep everything running smoothly. In that case, you'll want to follow the software maker's guidance. You might be able to excuse a relative lack of input and output ports on a sleek AIO. The screen and speakers are built-in, and you'll likely use a wireless keyboard and mouse, anyway. But mini PCs and desktop towers need the right selection of ports. At a minimum, they'll have to connect to a display, speakers or headphones, and a power source. On all but the absolute tiniest mini PCs, you should look for at least three USB 3.0 (or higher) ports, at least one of which should be the newer, oval-shaped Type-C variety if you have any compatible peripherals that plug directly into that kind of port. Future-proofers will want to seek out USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 options, which both use the Type-C standard with increased speeds and bandwidth. Expect to see the even-faster Thunderbolt 5 standard pop up more in the future, as Apple's Macs have already adopted it in their desktops featuring M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. You'll also typically find an HDMI output (and perhaps another video output or two, such as DisplayPort or VGA), a 3.5mm audio jack, a connector for an external Wi-Fi antenna, and a receptacle for a physical lock. Note that some mini PCs use scaled-down "mini" versions of HDMI or DisplayPort, which require a different kind of input cable or a dongle. Make sure the machine's video outputs are compatible with your display and its cabling. Larger tower PCs will have many more ports, providing support for pretty much any peripheral you need to connect. Expect six or more USB ports, for starters. On larger towers, one or two of these should support Thunderbolt over USB-C. Also, a given: an Ethernet jack for wired networking and multiple DisplayPort and HDMI jacks on the dedicated GPU for connecting one or more external monitors. Note that a tower with a graphics card may also have video outputs that stem from the motherboard, but you should only use the video outputs on the GPU. Many towers will also have multiple audio ports, including possibly an optical output and ports for individual speaker channels in a surround-sound setup. Make sure that these match up with any gear you may have; the number of surround-sound jacks can vary depending on the PC and its motherboard. Note that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, while reliably present on even the cheapest laptops and many smaller desktops, is not a given on larger towers. High-end workstations and gaming desktops sometimes have a second Ethernet port for doubling network bandwidth or for always-connected redundancy, while business desktops sometimes include legacy connectors such as VGA video outputs, PS/2 peripheral ports, or serial ports. The throwback-style ports are included for people who still need to use them with older, specialized hardware such as point-of-sale scanners or industrial equipment. Of course, you can buy dongles and adapters for these special port needs, but the possibility of having them built in is a key benefit of choosing a desktop over a laptop. When evaluating a desktop, beyond looking at what ports are present, also evaluate where they are. Are they easily accessible? Towers tend to have a few commonly used ports on the top or front (usually a headphone jack and a few USB ports). Some AIOs, in contrast, have some of their key ports hidden behind the stand in hard-to-reach places. Some buying concerns, no less crucial than the ones above, apply only to certain types of desktops. For instance, deciding on a screen size and type is critical for AIO shoppers. A touch-enabled display with support for in-plane switching (IPS) to widen viewing angles is welcome for an AIO that serves as the family's calendar or photo album, but know that touch support is not currently available on Apple's iMacs. Give some deep thought to the screen resolution, whatever the panel size. A 4K or even 5K resolution makes for a breathtaking screen, especially one that's 27 inches or larger, but such resolutions often add significantly to the price. As a result, you may want to settle for a screen with a full HD or 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution and spend money to upgrade other components instead. Also, look for multiple cameras, one facing the rear, that could make an AIO a smart choice, say, for an ID-card printing station. Fan noise is also a consideration with AIO since their computing components will be on your desk instead of hidden underneath it. The best desktop towers have many idiosyncrasies. Enthusiasts who like to tinker with components but aren't interested in building their own best PCs from scratch will need to pay special attention to the number and type of expansion bays and how easily they can access power and data cables. They should also check the maximum wattage rating of the power supply unit (PSU) and whether the case has the clearance for bigger coolers (or the mounting points for liquid cooling gear) if they plan to add a more powerful CPU later on. A low-wattage PSU, such as a 300-watt model used in a desktop with integrated graphics, might preclude adding a graphics card later on without upgrading the PSU, too. Note also that some ultra-budget desktop PCs use low-wattage, custom-design PSUs that can't support a graphics card and also aren't easy to upgrade due to their use of nonstandard connectors on the motherboard side. Again, this is where a careful reading of reviews comes in. Desktop towers and mini PCs also require separate speakers or headphones to deliver audio. If you don’t already have them, you'll have to spend extra money to buy some, and in the case of dedicated speakers, they'll take up room on your desk. For people who don't care as much about audio quality and just want loud enough audio to hear family members on the other end of a Skype call, the built-in speakers of an AIO should work just fine. There is no single best time to buy for most people in the market for an inexpensive desktop tower. While traditional sale holidays such as Black Friday can net you the odd bargain, when you find a system whose features, price, and performance match what you're looking for, take it home. However, people who need copious amounts of CPU or GPU muscle (and who have a clear idea of what hardware moves the performance needle with the apps they use) should pay attention to PC-component release cycles. Traditionally, Intel has announced new desktop CPU generations once a year, with the new chips showing up in PCs in the fall or early in the holiday shopping period. (This has shown more variance in recent years.) New graphics card releases are less frequent and depend on the vagaries of technical advances—Nvidia's highly successful GeForce GTX 1000 series, for example, was the cutting edge for several years before the first GeForce RTX cards were announced. Keeping track of PC component release cycles helps you become aware of what's new before you buy and also what is going off-market. For shoppers seeking maximum value or on a tight budget, getting a desktop based on a discounted last-generation (but still powerful) CPU or GPU can be the way to go. Meanwhile, shoppers looking for an all-in-one PC should pay attention to Apple's announcements. Many other manufacturers copy—and, sometimes, improve upon—the field-leading designs of the Apple iMac. Since you won’t be lugging a desktop around nearly as much as you would a laptop, it’s less important to handle the chassis and test-drive its build quality in the store before you bring it home. Still, if the desktop comes with peripherals included, it can be helpful to type a few lines and move the mouse around in the store. Setting eyes on an all-in-one desktop is more crucial than with a typical tower desktop or mini PC. The screen is an integral part of what you are buying, and eyes-on time matters, especially if you’re not well-versed, say, in the differences between a 24-inch and 27-inch panel or a 1080p screen versus a 4K one. If you limit yourself only to the selection at your local electronics outlet, though, you’ll miss out on many excellent desktops. Some configurations can be exclusive to a single reseller, such as Best Buy, Costco, or Walmart. Other merchants, such as Micro Center, frequently have in-store-only deals that aren't available anywhere online. This is where return policies come in handy. If you find the best desktop for you online but can't test drive it locally, a seller with a liberal return policy is your best friend. Just make sure you've got adequate time to return it if it doesn't work out. Most desktop makers provide one-year warranties on parts and labor, with extensions available for as many as five years at an additional charge. Before you pay to extend the warranty, though, check your credit card account benefits guide—your issuer might cover mishaps for a short period after you buy a new product and possibly extend the manufacturer's warranty, too. (For example, many MasterCard accounts include a doubling of the standard warranty period, up to one year.) If your card issuer doesn’t cover you and you plan on keeping your desktop for several years, look into the cost of added coverage. Some manufacturers and resellers offer a wide range of extended warranties; expect to spend $100 to $300 for one of these options. Our rule of thumb is that if a warranty costs more than 15% of the desktop’s purchase price, you're better off spending the money on backup drives or services that minimize downtime and protect precious data that you can't replace. Many people considering desktops in the $200-to-$500 range should also consider a refurbished machine. In certain circumstances, they can be excellent values. Large corporations lease fleets of desktops for a few years at a time, after which third parties refurbish them and provide them for resale on eBay and via retailers such as Best Buy, Newegg, and TigerDirect. To find these systems, search or filter the product category pages for "off-lease" or refurbished systems. These refurbished PCs are often surprisingly cheap ($150 to $250 is common), and many are desktop towers, so they're easy to upgrade or service if a component goes south. They do come with drawbacks. Their components are usually several years behind the cutting edge, they may be in imperfect cosmetic condition (some refurbishers grade condition on an A-B-C scale), and different refurbishers can have varying levels of attention to detail. Still, refurbs can be a fine option if you're looking for a cheap desktop to stow in a cabinet or under a desk, used to check your email and calendar. Just be sure to buy from a seller with a reasonable return policy in case you get a dud. Armed with all of the knowledge and decision points above, you're almost ready to shop. The final consideration is how well a desktop PC performs. We review dozens of PCs every year, evaluating their features and testing their performance against peers in their respective categories.

Title: Accounting rule changes have turned Bitcoin from risky venture to corporate must-have – Bitwise

According to Matt Hougan, the demand from this companies could impact the Bitcoin market in a positive and significant way. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan believes that companies adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets are no longer an anomaly but a burgeoning megatrend that could transform the crypto market this year. In a recent memo to clients, Hougan highlighted that MicroStrategy has been making the headlines with its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy. The company has acquired approximately 257,000 BTC, more than all the Bitcoin mined last year, and plans to raise an additional $42 billion to continue its purchases. Hougan noted that the trend goes far beyond MicroStrategy. As of Jan. 14, 70 publicly traded companies, including household names like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre, hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies hold 141,302 BTC combined, while private firms such as SpaceX and Block.one have disclosed at least 368 BTC in holdings. According to Hougan, the game-changer is the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) introduction of ASU 2023-08. This rule allows publicly traded companies to mark Bitcoin holdings to market value, enabling them to record profits when Bitcoin’s price rises. Previously, Bitcoin was treated as an “intangible asset,” forcing companies to write down its value if the price fell but not allowing them to recognize gains when it increased. With reputational risks declining and the accounting landscape more favorable, Hougan predicts an explosion in the number of companies buying Bitcoin. He estimates that the current count of 70 could grow to hundreds, even thousands, in the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, Hougan argues that companies buy Bitcoin for the same reasons individuals do. Some see it as a hedge against dollar depreciation, others as a speculative asset to boost stock prices, and others as a signal of innovation to attract customers and talent. While motivations vary, he believes the influx of corporate demand has the potential to drive Bitcoin prices significantly higher, particularly as major players like Meta and others contemplate entry. Hougan concludes the document by saying that retail investors don’t need to understand why every company is buying Bitcoin. Instead, they should ask themselves where this demand is heading and what it means for the market.

Title: Microsoft lays off employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming — separate from performance cuts

Microsoft is laying off employees across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, according to two people familiar with the matter. A Microsoft spokesperson said the layoffs were small but didn't specify a figure. They also said the layoffs were unrelated to the job cuts Business Insider recently reported, which were targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the people familiar with the matter said employees started receiving notifications on Tuesday about layoffs in Microsoft's security unit. The group is run by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon, who stunned the industry when he left for Microsoft in 2021 to lead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for every employee. The change followed years of security issues at Microsoft, including what the Department of Homeland Security called "a cascade of security failures" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. The company also made security a core priority on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews. "If you're faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to Microsoft employees last year.

Title: The Best Wireless Earbuds, Tested For Months By Our Tech Editor

Time Published: 2025-01-14T21:03:30Z

As the tech editor at Forbes Vetted, wireless earbuds need to tick a few boxes to earn my recommendation: They need to have great sound, stellar noise cancellation, a long battery life and intuitive controls. And since they always come with a carrying case, they should be portable and easy to locate if you happen to lose them around your home or office. The catch? After testing 19 pairs over several months, I found that there’s no one-size-fits-all best wireless earbud for everyone (more on that below). My personal top pick is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds, which combine incredible audio quality and noise cancellation—by far the best of all the pairs I tested. But, they’re not going to be everyone’s favorite for a couple of reasons. abc The Bose are pricey, and in addition to the almost-$300 cost, you have to pay an extra $49 if you want a wireless charging case. Further, the battery drains after just a few hours. So if you’re not keen on spending hundreds on a pair of earbuds or you value battery life as a top priority, there are plenty of other worthy options. My top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, can get you pretty great sound for less than $80. Others, like the premium Denon PerL Pros, use AI to enhance audio based on your ear shape. Based on rigorous testing with 19 sets over several months, here are my picks for the best wireless earbuds for 2025. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 6 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 8.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The noise canceling of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is unparalleled. During my testing, there were multiple times that I didn’t hear my husband approach until he tapped my shoulder. Subway rides also were also muted and I could enjoy reading my Kindle Paperwhite in near silence, quite a feat considering how screechy New York City public transit can be. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds feature an oval-shaped eartip for ergonomic comfort. While the equalizer adjustment controls aren’t too detailed (you can change the earbuds’ frequencies for bass, mids and trebles for up to six levels in either direction), they get the job done, and it’s not fully necessary to adjust them at all. I found myself only tweaking them a bit to enhance the bass, since the audio quality is so good out of the box. And if you find yourself swapping between your laptop and phone regularly, they support multipoint connectivity. All said, there are a couple drawbacks that left me less than enthused. For one, the battery life is relatively short; I wore them on a transcontinental flight and used them in the airport, thinking I would get a full six hours with ANC on—but I heard the dreaded low battery notification mid-flight. It’s not the end of the world—a quick 15-minute charge gets you another two hours in a pinch—but it’s a big enough drawback that if you want long-lasting earbuds, look elsewhere. Secondly, the case is a bulky beast that does not offer wireless charging, and you need to pay an additional $49 for a wireless charging case. I personally find this insulting, considering the already-costly $299 sticker price. Ultimately, I chose Bose’s QuietComfort Ultras as my top choice based solely on sound quality, and yes, it’s that good. Finally to clarify, the brand has wireless headphones with the same name, so keep this in mind when shopping to avoid confusion.

Battery life: Up to 44 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IP55 | Drivers: 10.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The OnePlus Buds 3 feel like a dark horse winner as my best budget pick, but after extensive testing, they’re truly the best if you’re mindful of your spending. The earbuds come with touch controls, which is mostly fine, though during testing I learned the hard way not to apply a lot of pressure. If you do, the earbuds shift in your ear canal. They won’t fall out–they were quite secure in my ear–but it can be annoying. A simple tap or gentle long press is all you need to control them. If you’re not an iPhone or OnePlus phone user, then the app may also give you pause. The Hey Melody app for Android users doesn’t get as deep into the frequency weeds as other earbud apps, like the Denon PerL Pros. Still, it does a solid job of delivering the basics, including four listening profiles and the ability to create a custom profile via five different frequency settings. The OnePlus Buds 3 have a sleek design that fit snugly and comfortably in my ears. Looking past the app, though, the price/value ratio on these earbuds wowed me. The audio felt detailed and rich, especially once I turned on OnePlus 3D Audio (the brand’s version of spatial audio). I also completed a sound test profile to help finesse my listening experience, which enhanced some areas that I felt were lacking. They simply have no right to sound as good as they do, with some of the details in the mids layering nicely compared with other competitors in this price range. Could the audio be better? Absolutely—the bass in particular could be stronger. But at that point, you’re looking at spending three figures on the Bose or the Denons to get that high-quality deep bass. These earbuds cost around $70, and for the price, you get pretty darn good audio.

Battery life: Up to 26 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP57 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro wireless earbuds don’t offer the single best audio quality, and the ANC isn’t the absolute best on the market. But when I’m heading into the subway, or when I’m about to hop on a plane, they’re the pair I always take with me. I’ve had them since July’s Samsung Unpacked, and after testing them for several months with my Android device, they’re my top pick for the category because they represent the best combination of ANC, audio quality and more for Android users. Yes, they mimic the Apple AirPods’ design—that’s something the company caught flack for at the initial launch. But that design wears comfortably in my ears and I can keep them in for long hours without my ears feeling itchy, a problem I experience with most wireless earbuds. The Samsung Buds 3 Pros look similar in design to the Apple AirPods, but they're built for Android ... [+] users. Go to the app to adjust your ANC levels. There you’ll also find a few audio presets, including balanced, dynamic and bass boost. Personally, I found dynamic to be the most effective, but your mileage and preferences may vary. Other useful features include 360 audio which aims to place you in the middle of the action, and you can also turn on head-tracking if that suits you. Songs like Florence and the Machine’s “King” and “Cosmic Love” sounded rich and detailed. I typically test audio for the balance of the harp in the latter against the rest of the instrumentals. While further into the song, the harp was hard to distinguish, it’s still good enough for most needs. With many earbuds offering touch controls, the physical buttons feel like a boon in a sea of accidental touches, something that I’ve had happen more times thanks to my bushy hair. I’ve also felt the advertised battery life—around 7 hours—is good. Because they pair best with Samsung phones and I use the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I can open the settings and see the battery life at a glance from the Bluetooth display. But that leads to another caveat: Android versus iOS. If you have an Android phone, particularly a Samsung device, these earbuds integrate just fine. If you have iOS, though, you may have a problem, as Apple users don’t have access some of the Wear app integrations—and to an extent, this affects Google Pixel users, too. But if you have an Android phone—and ideally a Samsung—these are the earbuds to get.

Battery life: Up to 20 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP54 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: While the AirPods Pro 2 provide high fidelity audio and the new Hearing Aid features, if you don’t want all the extras, the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC (active noise cancellation) should be at the top of your list. They feature Apple’s signature sleek design, but what you don’t get is the silicone ear tips (which tend to deliver a more secure fit). If you’re not a jogger or if you’re not worried about an adjustable fit, this won’t matter much since I found they stayed firmly in my ears during my testing, despite my initial fear that they would fall out. One of my biggest surprises during testing was just how good the audio quality is despite the modest price tag. Could they sound better? Probably. But I pitted them against two earbuds—the Denon PerL Pros and the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8s—and I struggled to hear any audio quality differences among the three. That speaks pretty well about the audio fidelity that these affordable AirPods can output. It wasn’t until I tested this pair on Florence and The Machine’s “Cosmic Love” that I spotted some subtle differences in the mids and basses. Even then, if you’re not actively listening for audio details, you’re probably not going to notice. You won't find silicone ear tips on the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC. The ANC on them is also surprisingly good, but again, you’re not getting those silicone ear tips so don’t expect the best ANC that Apple has to offer. Apple’s ANC has a mode called Conversation Awareness that automatically adjusts so you can hear what’s going on around you when it detects that you’re talking to someone. It was great when I worked at home and wanted to tune out the schoolchildren in my neighborhood. But there were moments when I was listening to music and it registered my husband speaking with his parents in the same room and randomly subdued my audio when it registered that as a conversation. As for its battery life, it’s on par with Apple’s claim of four hours with ANC on, based on my testing. It’s not the best by far, but if you’re a casual listener, odds are you won’t be using them for more than four hours at a time, anyway.

Battery life: Up to 40 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 10mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: I’ve tested countless earbuds, but it’s not every day that I find a pair whose sound sets a new bar for audio quality. That’s exactly what happened when I tried the Denon PerL Pro wireless earbuds. Yes, they look like giant discs and feel a little unwieldy in my ears. But in my estimation, the audio quality is comparable products in the $300 price range. The Denon PerL Pros have a unique build. Interestingly, Denon refers to the earbuds’ ANC as the Immersion mode, and the earbuds “scan” your ears to customize the way it interacts with your ears. It sounds cool, and if you don’t want more control over your personalization, you can, but I don’t recommend it—the scan works just fine, and it’s designed for audiophiles that want to tinker with every single frequency. Once I’d completed the scan and switched to this mode, my audio was something of a mixed bag. Ashnikko’s songs sounded bass-heavy, while Florence and the Machine’s catalogue sounded incredible. I could hear every layer with clarity, even with the bass feeling overpowered during “Dog Days Are Over.” I also cross-tested with two other Florence songs, “King” and “Cosmic Love,” and found that for once I could clearly hear the bass on the former and every pluck of the harp on the latter. It was simply delightful. Remember when I mentioned they look unwieldy in my ears? They dwarf my ears when worn. However, there are some minor caveats to consider before splurging on these. They look like giant discs stuffed into your ears, and for those who thrive on subtlety and sleekness, that may be off-putting. The other issue is the “Immersion” ANC mode: You can’t control it. I’ve found in my travels that the ANC could be improved, as it’s not the strongest compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultras or even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

Battery life: 10 hours (without ANC); 40 hours with case | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: When the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds launched, I took them on two flights to test them for my full-length review. Even after returning home, I found myself skipping my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset in favor of these earbuds. SteelSeries nailed the comfort level right off the bat, offering three ear tips sizes to suit most needs, and the design fits snugly in my ear. Another key feature I appreciate is the physical button controls. It may sound surprising considering the industry shift to touch controls, but it’s a huge factor on why I keep coming back to these as my main gaming headset. With them, there are no accidental touches if you brush your hair behind your ear during gaming. SteelSeries products, including the Arctis GameBuds, offer a special EQ software called Sonar. Typically installed on a PC, in this case, it’s in the form of an app. This creates a caveat for gamers, though: no multipoint connectivity. Still, I appreciate that I can use either Bluetooth or 2.4GHz (with a dongle) to connect to my devices, including my beloved Nintendo Switch. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds feature physical buttons. The Arctis’ audio for music is quite good, but its real claim to fame is its gaming audio. You get spatial audio for gaming in a compact, portable package. It’s good enough that when battling in Far Cry 6, I can still hear movements clearly on one earbud versus the other. I can also hear the direction enemies move from—that’s very important as a gamer, and props to SteelSeries for factoring it into this compact package. As earbuds, this pick doesn’t quite rival the best gaming headsets if you want a truly immersive experience. Also, the battery life is underwhelming at 10 hours, as opposed to gaming headsets that can pack in 20 hours—and as much as 300 hours—of use before needing a recharge. But in the realm of wireless earbuds, 10 hours is impressive, especially since most of the picks on my list can only go up to six or eight hours before requiring a recharge. All in all, given their price and the audio quality, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are an incredible product that I find myself using almost daily. A quick note: If you plan on using these with your PlayStation, you’ll want the PlayStation model. It’s an important distinction to help get the most out of the gaming features available on these earbuds.

Battery life: Up to 7.5 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm (unconfirmed) | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: The Bose Ultra Open earbuds combine two features that are essential to runners: A comfortable, nonslip fit for hours of comfortable wear, and an open audio environment that lets you hear the world around you through your music. The earbuds clip onto your ear helix (you know, the outer, curved part of your ear) so you can wear them for hours in comfort. While I didn’t personally test this pair, they were (and continue to be) a top contender chosen by Forbes executive editor Dave Johnson, who has extensive experience testing, writing and editing in the tech world. “They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and they stay doggedly affixed to my ear no matter what I’m doing,” he says, adding that he uses them regularly in his workout routines. “Traditional earbuds, like the Apple AirPods Pro, tend to work themselves loose when I’m working out at the gym and I always need to fiddle with them to keep them from falling out while jogging on the treadmill. That’s no longer a problem with the Ultra Open.” That said, the audio is where the Opens begin to lose some of their appeal, and for audiophiles, you’ll want to decide whether it’s worth that ever-so-slight downgrade. During testing, the earbuds held up really well against the competition. “The sound is rich and full, with excellent spatial audio, and I can still feel the bass even though a lot of it is just radiated away into the air around my ears,” shares Johnson. But, it’s important to note that the bass doesn’t quite hit the same as compared with other earbuds, especially when compared to its sibling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras. The battery life is also surprisingly stellar for a first-gen design, which wowed our testers. “I think Bose expects you to just leave these things clipped to your ears all day long, and the respectable battery life lets you do that,” says Johnson. He regularly enjoys more than 7 hours of continuous runtime with spatial audio off (it dropped to around 4.5 hours with spatial audio on). And, if you’re running low on battery, the accompanying case gets him an additional two full charges, too. Be sure to take a look at the new chilled lilac color, a Bose website exclusive; if I had to relive my life, I would have sprung for those pastel hues. Soundcore Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: This year at CES—an annual, world-renown tech exhibition—an Anker PR rep handed me this pair of Soundcore AeroClips, telling me they had just launched and to take them for a spin. An offshoot to Anker, Soundcore is a budget-friendly line that promises to deliver big sound for less. I tossed them on my ears and essentially wore them nonstop for a few days, wearing out the eight-hour battery life to get a sense of how they performed. The Soundcore AeroClips are comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their ... [+] bulk. I was tickled pink by how delightful I found these open ear wireless earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their bulk, which was surprising; unlike the Bose Ultra Opens, which are my “best open ear” pick, the AeroClips “clip” onto your ear helix (although, I also felt they rested on my ears a bit). I did note that sometimes I needed to adjust them with my glasses on, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Bose still takes the cake in comfort, but I didn’t mind wearing these for many hours. I was also very pleasantly surprised with the audio on these, but there’s a caveat: Soundcore offers a Soundcore Signature preset that I find abysmal at best. As a classically trained musician, I believe music should be balanced and clear so you feel like you’re smack dab in the action; too much bass, and it gets muddy, whereas an emphasis on treble frequencies can leave your audio sounding tinny. The Signature preset across a few Soundcore models varies greatly, and on the AeroClips, there was virtually no balance whatsoever. But, not all is lost here. I found the cinematic sound I sought with the Classical preset, which is the one I would recommend using. if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget, this pair is hard to beat. Ultimately, open ear wireless earbuds at this price shouldn’t sound this good, but Soundcore pulled it off—and kudos to them, because I’m impressed. Soundcore put a lot of thought and consideration into the AeroClips, and it shows in these earbuds. You’ll have to wait a bit to get them as they begin shipping January 22, but if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget—specifically if you want buds to use while running in the park , letting you listen to audio while also hearing outside noises—this pair is hard to beat. While my top picks represent some of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, many others didn’t quite make the cut. Below are 11 more models I tested, plus reasons why they didn’t earn a spot on this list. Anker Soundcore C40i ($90 at Amazon): I wanted to love the Soundcore C40i wireless earbuds, and if budget is your priority for open ear wireless earbuds, these are the pick for you. But I found the audio quality to be lacking. It’s good enough for runs and general gym activities, but if you spend an extra $30 for the AeroClips (which made it on this list), your ears will thank you. OnePlus Buds 3 Pro ($99 at Amazon): The OnePlus Buds 3 Pros are pretty darn good, but they don’t fit into any specific category. Like my top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, they use the Melody app if you’re not a OnePlus or iPhone user, but it’s still a worthwhile pick. That said, if you’re a OnePlus user, it’s worth the upgrade to the Buds 3 Pro over the Buds 3. Audio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2 ($149 at Amazon): The ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds excel at one thing: battery life. They can last up to 15 hours with ANC on, 25 without, and you get an extra 40 hours with the charging case. The audio, however, felt a little too muddy for my taste despite fiddling with the EQ. It’s still pretty darn good though, and most users will be happy with this pair. It’s also hard to argue with another huge boon to their build: physical buttons, which are quickly becoming a relic in earbud designs—I personally love this choice. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 ($320 at Amazon): I wanted to love these earbuds—they were on par with the Denon PerL Pros during my testing. However, both managing editor Emmy Favilla and I both had connectivity issues with two separate review units during our testing. For the price—the highest of any I tested at $399—that’s unacceptable. If you can stomach that, you may have to put them back in the case once or twice before they work in your ears, then they’re a good choice. Sony LinkBuds ($178 at Amazon): These were also a near miss. They feature a new, innovative design with ear tips shaped like a comma. However, I found them uncomfortable in my ears even after adjusting and swapping ear tips multiple times. Despite deep testing the audio features, I found the audio quality lacking, and I had concerns over the case’s longevity; it felt cheaply built. Simply put, while they’d be great for teens, as an audiophile, I wasn’t a fan. JLab GoPop ANC ($30 at Walmart): I loved these earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long periods, and the charging case is tiny and features a built-in charging cable. My problem? At the loudest, they’re not very loud in my ears, and many of the songs I listened to lacked bass even with the bass boost turn on. Still, for the price, these would be a great choice for teens who want decent audio without a sky-high price tag. JLab JBuds Mini ($40 at Amazon): For their tiny size, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the power behind the JLab JBuds Mini Wireless Earbuds. That said, I found that I needed the largest size for one of my ears, otherwise the earbud felt too loose; your mileage may vary, and they may not fit if you have larger ears. They also don’t come with ANC—only passive noise cancellation. I still had to turn the earbuds down to hear my husband during walks in the local park, so while not the strongest, it does reduce some sound. One thing to note: During testing, I noted that on windy days, the Bluetooth connectivity frequently cut out, which is why they didn’t make my best budget pick. Baseus M2 (out of stock): The Baseus M2s are really comfortable in the ears and for the price, the ANC is surprisingly very effective. I found myself tossing these in my ears fairly often at my desk to tune out the school next door to my house over others due to how effective it was. However, the audio for music doesn’t quite match up to its competitors. It’s great for podcasts and audiobooks, though, and its price is very attractive. Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro ($199 at Amazon): During testing, Favilla noted the Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro felt comfortable to wear over long periods of time, and taking calls felt seamless. The sound quality is on par with the previous generation, and they paired almost instantly with a Google Pixel 7 Pro. Google did a stellar job upgrading its ANC from the previous generation, too. Marshall Motif II ANC ($150 at Amazon): The Motif II ANC earbuds sound pretty great, and packs punchy basses and high trebles for an enjoyable listening experience. But upon further testing, the noise canceling and construction could be improved. Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 ($200 at Best Buy): The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds have some of the best ANC in the business, with a solid audio profile, to boot. They’re so good they nearly eliminate airplane engines in flight. Unfortunately, Jabra announced this generation is the last in its consumer line it will produce. More concerning, Jabra only guaranteed updates for two years. With most earbuds lasting much longer than that, I can’t fully recommend a short-lived product. To find the best wireless earbuds on the market, I put over a dozen pairs to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Sony and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test. The best wireless earbuds should feel sturdily built, with a sleek design that feels comfortable in your ears. After all, if you’re wearing them for an extended period of time, you shouldn't feel any discomfort. I also evaluated the design based on wireless charging versus wired only, case bulk and more. No matter what genre you’re listening to, your audio quality should have a reasonable balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each pair of wireless earbuds across a variety of songs, and I considered whether ANC and spatial audio changed the overall sound quality. Some of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of wireless earbuds include: When you’re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested these earbuds for 30 minutes each, logging battery light percentage at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this with the ANC on versus off to get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims. I’ve been involved in tech journalism for over five years, including more than a year as the consumer tech and electronics editor at Forbes Vetted. In addition to working with home entertainment, such as testing the best gaming TVs and the best TVs for bright rooms, I have also tested most of the latest smart wearables currently on the market, from the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova GameBuds and more. In my time testing wireless earbuds, I focus on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual folks who want a no-frills set of earbuds for occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum. For this story, I focused on various features each pair of wireless earbuds offered as they applied to work, travel and more everyday scenarios. I evaluated a slew of features on each pair, including audio quality, software integrations, ANC and more. I also made sure to test each earbuds for a minimum of 10 hours to dive into the finer details each pair offered. I also carefully reviewed the software for each pair of wireless earbuds offered to determine which had the best balance of features and price. When I’m not testing the latest audio equipment, I’ve spent plenty of time testing the newest mobile devices. I’ve deep-dived into the Apple ecosystem with the iPhone 16 Pro and reviewed plenty of Android devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Google Pixel 8. Most recently, I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro. I added two new recommendations: the Anker Soundcore AeroClip earbuds as the best budget open ear pick and the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds as the best gaming earbuds. I also added notes on three other contenders that didn’t quite make the cut.

Title: Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos Are All Headed to Trump’s Inauguration
URL: https://gizmodo.com/musk-zuckerberg-and-bezos-are-all-headed-to-trumps-inauguration-2000550103

Full Content:
It should come as no surprise at this point, but NBC News is reporting that Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos will all be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. What do all of these tech leaders have in common? They have all publicly come out with varying degrees of support for Trump’s incoming administration, and all three have donated money to his campaign or the inauguration. It represents a major pivot from Trump’s first time in office when the tech industry kept its distance from him and eventually booted him from their services altogether following the January 6 Capitol riots. Zuckerberg in particular has gone from having a quite acrimonious relationship with Trump, who threatened him with prison over his stance on moderating conservative content, but now feels better about him as Zuckerberg has promised to loosen content restrictions on Meta’s platforms, gotten rid of the company’s DEI programs, and put in place an outspoken Republican to lead its policy arm. Bezos, as the owner of the Washington Post, regularly received barbs from Trump his first go around and saw the possibility of USPS prices charged to Amazon being raised in retaliation for his newspaper’s coverage. Meta and Amazon have both donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and Elon Musk of course aggressively spent money campaigning for Trump’s re-election. He will be helping to cut government spending through DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, and has been looking to hire more figures from tech to staff the initiative. According to NBC, the three tech leaders will be seated “on the platform near cabinet officials and elected leaders.” What is perhaps most notable about Silicon Valley’s pivot towards Trump is just how out in the open it all is. Whereas in the past an investigative journalist might have needed to do some digging to discover pay-for-play schemes, none of the tech leaders here are hiding what they are doing. They are pulling out all the stops to get on Trump’s good side, prevent any attacks he might bring, and perhaps get preferential treatment for lucrative defense contracts. This despite the fact that tech employees tend to be much more liberal than their employers. But these leaders must figure the pros of supporting Trump outweigh the cons. Especially now that the tech industry has gone through massive layoffs in recent years, rank-and-file engineers do not have the power they once had.

Title: Meta Cuts 5% of Workforce to ‘Move Out Low-Performers,’ Zuckerberg Says

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting 3,620 jobs Another day, another round of big changes at Meta: The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting roughly 5% of its workforce — or 3,620 employees — as it looks to “move out low-performers faster,” according to a memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was obtained by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Zuckerberg said the cuts are coming after he “decided to raise the bar” on performance” at his company. “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,” Zuckerberg said. The 40-year-old Meta founder said employees who are laid off will be notified starting on February 10. Meta’s headcount at the end of September, the most recent period data is available for, was 72,404. Zuckerberg’s memo on the job cuts adds to a busy start to 2025 for the company. Notably, Meta ended its third-party fact checking operation last week, with Zuckerberg saying the move was about “restoring free expression” on Facebook and Instagram, where he said the fact checkers had made “too many mistakes” in recent years. Meta will be rolling out a new feature similar to X’s Community Notes, Zuckerberg said. On Friday, Zuckerberg compared the fact checking operation to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984,” while appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast. He added the Biden Administration “basically pushed” the company to censor certain topics, including what the government felt was COVID-19 misinformation. And in other Meta news, the company announced it was ending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs on Friday. Meta’s stock price is up 1.1% on the year to $596.27 per share.

“Very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away,” Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote presentation at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week. His comment sent shockwaves through the quantum computing industry, with shares of leading companies like Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum and IonQ plummeting between 30 and 50 percent. These companies’ CEOs were quick to defend their industry in a bid to win back investor confidence. Thank you for signing up!

He is ‘dead wrong’ about D-Wave,” Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave Quantum, which develops quantum computing systems, told Observer. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. Our (D-Wave) systems are performing scientific computations on important problems that are not solvable by even massively parallel GPU systems.” D-Wave uses quantum annealing, an approach that excels in solving specific computational optimization problems. This method is particularly useful for materials simulation, scheduling and logistics applications. “Commercial quantum computing is already here,” Baratz added. For example, Canada-based Pattison Food Group reduced an 80-hour scheduling task to 15 hours using D-Wave’s technology. Another client, NTT DOCOMO, Japan’s largest telecom provider, slashed the time to optimize network resources from 27 hours to just 40 seconds. Quantum computing CEOs are also talking up their companies’ revenue and profit prospects. D-Wave estimated its 2024 sales jumped 120 percent from the previous year. IonQ, which makes quantum computers, predicts it will turn a profit on more than $1 billion in sales by 2030, CEO Peter Chapman wrote in a blog post on Jan. 10. Quantum computing relies on qubits—units of data that can exist in multiple states at once—and holds the potential to quickly solve calculations that would take even supercomputers a thousand years. Exciting recent developments include Google’s Willow chip, which solved a random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark problem in just five minutes. RCS, one of the most challenging benchmarks for quantum computers, would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years (1 followed by 24 zeros) to solve, Google claims. However, showcasing potential is different than consistently solving problems. “Quantum systems are highly susceptible to environmental noise, which can disrupt quantum computations. Nick Harris, CEO and co-founder of Lightmatter, an Alphabet-backed photonic computing startup, told Observer. “The breakthrough of Google’s Willow chip does not apply to all quantum computing hardware platforms, and the reality today is that scaling up is nowhere near a given.” Other major challenges include scaling qubit systems while preserving their coherence and connectivity, as well as improving qubit fidelity. “Even with error correction, individual qubit operations still carry a non-zero error rate. Reducing these errors further is essential for achieving reliable computations,” Harris explained. The quantum computing industry is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company. However, Huang’s remarks brought that lofty vision back down to earth. Huang predicted it would be 15 to 30 years before quantum computing is commercially viable. Daniela Herrmann, co-founder of Dynex, a quantum-as-a-service company, partially agrees with that assessment. “Huang’s extended timeline reflects the broader understanding of the challenges in achieving fully developed quantum systems, but it doesn’t fully acknowledge the progress being made by existing quantum-inspired applications,” Herrmann told Observer. She noted that Huang’s remarks seem to keep the spotlight on initiatives like Nvidia’s CUDA-Q, which is yet to solve real-world problems at scale. Quantum computing companies, including Phasecraft, Zapata Computing and Algorithmiq, are making notable strides in developing algorithms that can leverage the limited capabilities of existing quantum hardware. Moreover, advancements in quantum computation optimization are also being spearheaded by the University of Chicago and Stanford University, with recent initiatives focusing on optical computing and exploring its applications in quantum technologies. “Advanced language model A.I. tasks that previously required extensive resources are now being completed with 90 percent less computational overhead,” Herrmann said. “Many tangible business cases don’t necessarily require a universal (gate-model) quantum computer to provide advantages,” Anders Indset, chairman of Njordis Group, a VC firm investing in quantum technology companies, told Observer. “Recent sharp dip seems more like a near-term market correction than a final verdict on quantum’s future. ” Indset believes that Huang’s own economic interests in the field could influence his desire to slow down potential competitors. “While Jensen Huang’s caution may reflect the tough realities ahead, history shows that breakthroughs can come faster than expected,” he said. “A.I.’s voracious need for compute resources is pushing the industry to explore new hardware frontiers—quantum included. Once quantum machines achieve a certain threshold, they could supercharge A.I. by making specific training or inference tasks dramatically faster.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX) on ValueInvestorsClub by RugPull1995. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SNX. The company’s shares were trading at $115.50 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $132.84 on Jan 13. A technical analyst using a cloud-based analytics dashboard for financial services. SNX operates as a distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology (IT) ecosystem. The company offers personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and accessories, printers, supplies, and endpoint technology software; and data center technologies, such as hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers, technology software, and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. It also provides systems design and rack integration, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assembly. SNX is the leading IT distributor in North America and Europe, with a global market share of 16%. While growth in this segment has stalled, Hyve, a business that manufactures servers, storage and networking equipment for hyperscalers, has tremendous potential. 40% of Hyve’s business comes from Meta and there is potential to strike a deal with Oracle in the next year. The cloud capex for Meta and Oracle are projected to be 13% and 32% from 2024 to 2027 and will have a direct bearing on Hyve’s business. With increasing geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, it provides more business opportunities as mega players like Meta, Microsoft and Amazon look to build onshore capabilities. This segment offers a higher margin and a better growth prospect compared to the distribution segment. The core business is also expected to witness an up-cycle from 2025. The demand for PCs during Covid surged due to work-from-home requirements. The average life of these PCs is 5 years, making 2025 the terminal year that would prompt users to buy new PCs. The fundamental logic can be applied to servers, network equipment and storage as well but with a slightly wider timeline i.e. 2020-2022. The stock trades at 10x its 2024 EPS and 8x based on its 2025 EPS estimates. Separately valuing Hyve at 10.5x its EBIT multiple and 9x for SNX’s other business yields a fair value of $157, implying a potential 19% upside with low risk. While we acknowledge the potential of SNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Predicts XRP, Solana ETFs Will Attract up to $8,000,000,000 Each: Report

JPMorgan Chase expects that potential Solana (SOL) and XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could see multi-billion dollar inflows. VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel reports on the social media platform X that JPMorgan says SOL and XRP ETFs could attract up to $16 billion in total. “SOL & XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) Could Attract $3-8bn Each: JPM ETP assets ($108bn) make up 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap ($1,874bn) after the ETPs’ first year of trading; likewise, ether ETP assets ($12bn) have a 3% penetration rate of the total Ethereum market cap ($395bn) within its first 6 months since launch. When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3-6bn of new net assets and XRP gathering $4-8bn in net new assets.” Last year, the chief executive of VanEck said that a Solana ETF could only be possible if the Republicans won the US Presidential Election. And last winter, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it “makes sense” for an XRP ETF to eventually be approved. “I think it makes sense that there will be other ETFs. It’s sort of like the earliest days of the stock market – you don’t really want exposure to one stock, or one company, you want to typically think about diversifying risk and what have you. I think we will see other [crypto] ETFs. When we will see them is hard to predict. The sad reality of what we saw with the Bitcoin ETF is [it happened] only because the courts forced the SEC’s hand, and really [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler’s hand.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Redshinestudio/Sensvector Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

The cuts to the software startup come despite record growth in the solar industry last year. Is laying off 350 people, or one-third of its headcount, after Amazon’s bid to acquire the Roomba-maker shuttered. Longtime CEO Colin Angle has also stepped down. Is reportedly laying off 700 workers, or around 1% of its staff. This comes after the company had a significant reduction of 10% of its workforce in 2023. Is reportedly planning to cut around 20% of its staff in the next few weeks. The company announced similar cuts in October, when founder Ryan Petersen returned as CEO and slashed its workforce by 20%. Is laying off 1,900 employees across its gaming divisions following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Blizzard president Mike Ybarra announced he will also be stepping down. Is cutting about 400 jobs, 7% of its workforce, as the food delivery startup seeks to bring further improvements to its finances ahead of a planned IPO later this year. Laid off dozens of workers, according to sources familiar with the decision. The autonomous vehicle technology company has since confirmed that about 3% of its workforce has been laid off. Will lay off 9% of the company’s workforce, affecting about 1,000 full-time employees. In a blog post, the company also plans to cut contract roles in the coming months. Announced it intends to offer voluntary buyouts or job changes to 8,000 employees amid restructuring. Laid off 20% of its staff, affecting 282 workers. In a blog post, Co-CEO Pedro Franceschi said that the company is prioritizing “long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains in our comp structure.” Eliminated around 60 jobs across the U.S. in Los Angeles, New York, and Austin in addition to layoffs in international markets. The affected roles, according to NPR’s initial reporting, are largely in sales and advertising. Is cutting 90% of its employees as it shuts down its online used car marketplace and shifts resources into two business units: one focused on auto financing and the other on AI-powered analytics. Is laying off 11% of its workforce, affecting about 530 employees, as the company focuses on “fewer, high-impact projects.” The League of Legends maker is also sunsetting its five-year-old publishing group, Riot Forge. Is eliminating 13% of its global workforce, affecting 1,650 employees, in a restructuring effort aimed at cutting layers of management. Will eliminate 100 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch, as part of a restructuring effort in its creator management and operations teams. Is laying off “hundreds” of employees in its advertising sales team, according to a leaked memo. The cuts come a week after the company did sweeping layoffs across its hardware teams. And more layoffs will come throughout the year, as CEO Sundar Pichai told the company in a memo obtained by the Verge. Reportedly laid off a “sizable” number of employees January 12. The game developer studio was acquired by Borderlands maker Gearbox in 2022. Is going to lay off employees in 2024, TechCrunch exclusively learned, with the total impacted employees potentially reaching as high as 20% of the animation studio’s 1,300 person workforce. The cutbacks come as Disney looks to reduce the studio’s output as it struggles to achieve profitability in streaming. Is laying off 5% of its workforce, citing an “increasingly challenging landscape,” according to a leaked memo obtained by Business Insider. Is laying off 17% of its staff, impacting 170 people. In an internal memo obtained by the Verge, Discord CEO Jason Citron blamed the cuts on the company growing too quickly. Laid off hundreds of employees across its Google Assistant division and the team that manages Pixel, Nest and Fitbit hardware. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are also exiting. Is laying off “several hundreds” of employees at Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo obtained by TechCrunch. The cuts come days after the 500 layoffs at Amazon’s Twitch. Is reportedly laying off 500 employees, 35% of its current staff, amid a continued struggle to achieve profitability in the face of rising costs and community backlash. The pending layoffs come after hundreds more employees were laid off in 2023. Confirmed to TechCunch that layoffs, conducted in December, had impacted 14 employees, accounting for 60% to 70% of the company, according to multiple sources. Confirmed it cut 10% of its contractor workforce at the end of 2023 as it turns to AI to streamline content production and translations previously handled by humans. Will cut about 10% of corporate roles as it goes through a restructuring plan following Anushka Salinas’ planned resignation as operating chief and president at the end of January. Is reducing its workforce by about 25%, or 1,800 people. The video game engine maker went through three rounds of layoffs in 2023. Laid off two-thirds of its employees as the German startup, which built collaborative presentation software, looks to pursue a “completely different path.” CEO and co-founder Christian Reber also stepped down. The AI and biomedical startup reportedly cut 17% of its workforce January 8, citing “shifts in the economic environment,” in a LinkedIn post announcing the layoffs. Eliminated 38% of its staff January 8 as the online retail logistics company follows up after conducting layoffs in September 2023. Announced January 8 it is laying off 28% of its staff, or 154 workers, as the small modular nuclear reactor company shifts its focus to “key strategic areas.” Is reportedly laying off 15% of its workforce focused on computer vision for retailers. Is shutting down at the end of 2024 after a 12 year run. The design collaboration startup was once valued at nearly $2B. Is laying off nearly 20% of its workforce as it tries to maintain its battle with Nielsen over media measurement. CEO Ross McCray stepped down from the company. Is laying off roughly 15% of its staff, totaling 60 employees. The Israel-based unicorn reportedly plans to move some impacted employees into other positions at the company. Laid off its entire 200-person workforce January 2 after attempts to raise more capital failed, TechCrunch exclusively learned. The mass layoff comes just seven months after the startup acquired rival Zencity. Topics Audience Development Producer Cody Corrall is the Audience Development Producer at TechCrunch. Based in Chicago, he previously ran social media accounts for BuzzFeed News and WTTW’s daily flagship program on PBS, “Chicago Tonight.” When they’re not tweeting, Cody can be found yelling about vampires on the Into the Twilight podcast.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI GPU Export Control Rules Likely To Tighten Under Trump Admin, Says Analyst

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Biden Administration's sweeping set of new rules that restrict AI chip sales to countries not aligned with US national security interests are unlikely to be watered down by the incoming Trump Administration, believes a Taiwan-based semiconductor analyst. The export control rules, which came soon after the CES conference in Las Vegas and amidst a fresh set of media reports outlining troubles with Blackwell GPU supplies, drew a sharp backlash from NVIDIA. The company, which commands an effective monopoly over the global AI chip supply chain, called the new export control rules an attempt to "undermine" American technology leadership by placing control of semiconductor exports in bureaucratic hands. The Biden Administration's latest rules divide the countries to which NVIDIA's advanced AI GPUs can be exported into three categories. The first is a list of nations that are either aligned with US national security objectives or are not a threat to the US. These countries can secure the chips without any hindrance. The second category consists of hostile nations such as Russia and Iran, which are completely barred from procuring either US-origin GPUs or AI software. Finally, the third category limits countries such as India from importing large amounts of GPUs without scrutiny. These nations will be able to import 1,700 GPUs without regulatory scrutiny, and they are designed to prevent the targeted countries from building large-scale data centers capable of advanced defense research. The rules also limit key AI software parameters, such as model weights, from being disclosed to nations. NVIDIA's response to them was hard-hitting, as it characterized the rules as threatening to "to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide." NVIDIA admitted that the new rules will not come into effect until 120 days but cautioned that they were already "undercutting U.S. interests." However, despite NVIDIA's praise of the previous Trump presidency in its comments, one analyst believes that the export rules are only set to tighten during the incoming administration. Sharing his thoughts on X, Taipei-based financial analyst Dylan Nystedt outlined several factors that make it unlikely that the issue "might go away under President Trump." He believes that the reality might be different, and "If anything, the rules are likely to become more extreme over time, not less." He starts off by sharing comments made by TSMC's founder, Dr. Morris Chang, in 2023, where he shared his thoughts and remarked that globalization is dead. Dr. Chang had made similar remarks in 2022 and saw a media mogul agree with him. In his 2023 remarks, the former TSMC boss had also supported American policy objectives of slowing down China's progress. Nystedt also believes that supercomputers are helping adversarial nations such as China and Russia to develop advanced military technologies. He outlined, "Supercomputers have already helped Russia and China develop hypersonic missiles, better jet planes and engines, improved nuclear modeling, more." As a consequence, the analyst outlines that the fear among Washington policy circles is that "AI will be able to help adversaries build far better weapons than engineering and design software has already done." He also shared a highly circulated image of a purported Chinese sixth-generation fighter aircraft prototype that appears to rival Northrop Grumman's Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. According to Nystedt, NVIDIA is misguided in its criticism of the US government. He concludes by outlining that "In its [NVIDIA] zeal to drive computing forward for the good of mankind, it forgot evil exists in the world." Nvidia is unlikely to see any change to the new US export rules on ‘AI Diffusion’ unveiled Monday (1/13). It is not an issue that might go away under President Trump. It is a US National Security issue.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks climbed during Tuesday morning trading after plunging earlier in the week. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock was up by almost 30% on Tuesday morning, while Quantum Computing (QUBT) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) saw shares up by around 17% and 15%, respectively. IonQ (IONQ) shares climbed by around 2%. The stocks fell slightly closer to noon, with Rigetti up by around 13%, D-Wave up by around 9%, and Quantum Computing up by almost 6%. IonQ shares fell by more than 2%. Both D-Wave and Rigetti saw shares fall by more than 25% during mid-day trading on Monday after Meta (META) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts on quantum computing’s potential in the near future. During an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, which was published Friday, Zuckerberg said he sees the technology’s usefulness a “decade-plus out.” “I’m not really an expert on quantum computing — my understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Quantum Computing shares fell by around 23%, while IonQ stock was down by more than 12% mid-day Monday. The previous week, the stocks also tanked after Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang shared similar sentiments that useful quantum computers are decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang said he sees the chipmaker, a major player in the artificial intelligence boom, playing “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, which will be able to quickly solve problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to complete. After Huang’s comments sent stocks falling, D-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said the Nvidia chief “has a misunderstanding of quantum,” in a statement shared with Quartz. “While he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,” Baratz said. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.” For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Title: I've had Costco's executive membership for 17 years. My family swears by these 11 products for easy dinners.

Time Published: 2025-01-14T16:48:02Z
Full Content:
I've been a Costco executive member for about 17 years now, and I rely on the warehouse chain when buying groceries for my family of four. Our executive membership is a huge help for saving money. Although it costs more than a standard Costco membership, we get an annual 2% back on eligible purchases. For us, it pays for itself and then some every year. Here are Costco meal staples I buy for prepping dinner for myself, my husband, and our two teens. Prices may vary by location. My family prefers thighs to breasts as they're more flavorful, easier to cook, and often cheaper. So, we stock up on Kirkland Signature boneless, skinless thighs and freeze whatever we don't use right away. We often grill them, slather them in mayonnaise to make family-favorite Parmesan-crusted chicken, toss them into soups, or chop them up for stir-fries. At Costco, we head to the meat counter and ask the butcher if we can buy the 10-pound tube of ground beef. We prefer this over the smaller package trays on display in the meat section, mostly because of the price. On a recent trip, the tube cost $4.39 a pound — 10 cents cheaper a pound than the other packages of ground beef available. When I pack this for freezing, I squeeze portions straight from the tube into my vacuum-sealing bags, which is much easier than picking chunks out of the foam trays. We usually pick up a 24-ounce Earthbound Farms organic Caesar-salad kit for $9. It pairs nicely with grilled chicken or steak and a baguette for a light but pleasing dinner that requires little effort. On a good day, our kids prep the salad and my husband grills the meat we add to it. On movie nights, I make homemade pizza. I already prepare my own dough and sauce, so I want my cheese pre-shredded. I like using Kirkland Signature shredded mozzarella because it's dry enough not to bog down a pizza. I pick up the 5-pound twin pack and break the bags into pizza-night-sized portions that I freeze until I'm ready to use. Kirkland Signature spinach-and-cheese ravioli are handy when I want to toss together ravioli pomodoro in a flash. These are also good for ravioli "lasagna," where these replace typical noodles as a shortcut to save time and use fewer ingredients. I love Garofalo tricolor organic pasta and can sometimes get six 1-pound packages for $10 at Costco. The colors and shapes are fun, and the pasta is delicious. I use the noodles to make all sorts of dinners, from cacio e pepe to pasta Bolognese. I can get 60 Trident fish sticks for $15 at Costco, and they're super convenient when I don't feel like cooking a full meal. I pop these babies in the oven, then pair them with frozen fries, peas, and tartar sauce for fish and chips with little-to-no effort. We usually pick up a 2-pound bag of Kirkland Signature raw, tail-on shrimp for about $12. I like to pair the shrimp with fries and roasted vegetables for a low-effort meal. The kids usually mix up cocktail sauce to go with the shrimp, too. The Kirkland Signature Normandy vegetable mix is hard to beat at $11 for 5 ½ pounds of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. If freezer space is low, I break up the large bag into smaller packages. Fortunately, frozen vegetables can be used in so many ways. I put them in soups and pasta primavera. I've also leaned into treating veggies like meat, so I toss them in olive oil and spice rubs and roast them as a side. Lotus Foods organic millet-and-brown-rice ramen noodles are one of my favorite gluten-free finds at Costco. We tried them after learning about my daughter's gluten allergy, and I like that the noodles have a texture our whole family enjoys. We make a lot of soup dishes in the winter and these noodles never disappoint, whether we're using them in khao soi or ramen. They're a great deal at Costco, too. We pay $9 for 30 ounces of noodles, which works out to 30 cents an ounce. At our local grocery store, these can cost $7 for a 10-ounce package — or 70 cents an ounce. My husband has fallen in love with quinoa, which works for me because I hate rice. This grain serves as a nice base for a lot of our meals that typically use the former. I buy the 4-½- pound bag of Kirkland Signature organic quinoa for $9. It lasts us a while and we've learned this is way cheaper than buying quinoa at our local grocery store.

Title: The Pokémon TCG Is In A Bad Situation, And The Pokémon Company Has To Step Up
URL: https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920
Time Published: 2025-01-14T15:35:00Z
Full Content:
Update: 1/15/2025, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a statement from The Pokémon Company International regarding this situation, which is reproduced in full below. In it, the company states that it is attempting to print more cards for the sniped sets, as well as promising restocks on the Pokémon Center websites in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The original story follows below, with the statement added at the bottom. The Pokémon trading card game (PTCG) is in a really big mess. And once again, it’s because it has become too popular for its own good. If you were hoping to pick up some product from the forthcoming Prismatic Evolutions special sets, well, good luck to you. And March’s just-announced Journey Together set? Pre-orders sold out in literal seconds. Whether it’s because of scalpers, a sudden new tidal wave of interest via Pokémon TCG Pocket, or evil space spiders, The Pokémon Company International desperately needs to react, and fast. I first noticed something was wrong the day that Prismatic Evolutions went up for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone. The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point, it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong. For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly. So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, often get the jump on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy. I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.” Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable immediately, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker. I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed. So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back. So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400, while others are selling their pre-orders of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart. What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, like 2023's 151, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s Pokémon TCG Pocket, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now. You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when Pokémon GO caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves. Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly caused Japan to sell out of all Pokémon cards, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English. The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game. And secondly, the game. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy anything new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.) As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems. With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on Kotaku, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.) But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.) I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.) In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done. Update: 01/15/2024, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a detailed reply from TPCi about this situation and the company’s attempts to address the issues with new reprints and restocks of its online stores. There is, however, no information regarding how it might attempt to prevent a repeat of the current situation, with bots and scalpers scooping everything first, nor indeed any mention of the other affected set, March’s Journey Together. Here’s the statement in full: We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this. Reprinted products are expected to be available at participating retailers as soon as possible to help ensure more fans receive opportunities to access Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions. In addition, more new products from the Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions lineup will be launching in the coming months. Pokémon Center preorders for Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products that were placed during the preorder timeframe will begin shipping in mid-January. Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products will be restocked at Pokémon Center in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand later this year. Fans can subscribe to the Pokémon Center newsletter to receive updates. We’d like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver this highly anticipated expansion to fans. .

The Dow and other indices rebounded on Tuesday following inflation data that came in cooler than anticipated. AI stocks that declined sharply on Monday recovered early Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Palantir (PLTR), Micron Technology (MU), and others all rising. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, increased by only 0.2% in December. This figure was lower than the projected rise of 0.4%. Additionally, the Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained unchanged. With that, all eyes are on Wednesday’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which measures retail inflation and will help determine whether or not the Fed will lower interest rates this year. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 218 points, or 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 shed 0.25% and 0.35%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been rising in the past few days, declined slightly to 4.78%. Oil prices also decreased, with West Texas Intermediate falling by 0.7%, trading around $78.25 per barrel. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and UnitedHealth (UNH) on Thursday. Bond markets are moving upward, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.78% as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve may delay lowering interest rates until 2026. This situation has also affected other economies. For instance, Japan, which tried to stabilize the economy and the yen last year, saw its 10-year government bond yield surpass 1%, reaching a 13-year high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the UK, 30-year gilt yields are at their highest levels since 1998. India, which is grappling with currency challenges as the rupee declines, saw its 10-year bond yield experience its biggest single-session rise in over a month on Monday, nearing a two-month high of 6.846%.

“The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World” by Natalia Peart, Ph.D. with Christopher Burge, is released with Forbes Books. NEW YORK (January 14, 2025) — The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World by Dr. Natalia Peart with Christopher Burge is now available. Published with Forbes Books, the exclusive business book publishing imprint of Forbes, this groundbreaking guide is available today on Amazon. The world has changed more in the last few years than in the previous fifty. People of all ages and income levels now face pervasive economic worries, from the high cost of living to inflation and the threat of layoffs. These worries have left many feeling vulnerable in their careers, finances, and lives. We’re also dealing with many big shifts and disruptions happening one right after the other or all at once. The epidemics of stress and burnout, as well as the rising anxiety, loneliness, and other mental health struggles, speak to the constant mental and emotional challenges we face. “Traditionally, success was a straightforward formula: get a degree, land a job, work hard, and enjoy the rewards, " Dr. Peart said. “But now, this is a more complex world with constant change and disruption as the norm, so the strategies that once promised a clear path to the American Dream, like pursuing a conventional education or climbing the company ladder, no longer guarantee success or even continual progress toward our goals.” Many of us find ourselves unprepared and uncertain since the old life blueprint and instructions for living a good life no longer apply. Peart and Burge respond to this challenge by reinventing the old blueprint into a modern-era career, mental, financial, and lifestyle blueprint. Their new roadmap provides readers with the instructions and guidance they need to equip and prepare themselves to navigate their professional and personal lives, build resilience in constant uncertainty, and achieve the sustainable success, health, wealth, and happiness they seek. The New Life Blueprint is important because it captures the urgency and necessity for a redefined approach to living in a complex world, making the central idea timely and impactful. Readers will also close the book armed with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to navigate their lives amidst ongoing changes and uncertainties.

Title: The Pharma Man’s Negative Reputation is Fair
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/pharma-man-negative-reputation-fair-1235233914/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Amal Naj A former senior executive in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Naj divides his time between overseeing medicine companies he has founded and writing; his latest book, Pandastic Times (Brazen House), is a fable of the Covid pandemic. Some two decades ago, when I mentioned what I did for a living — manufacturing and marketing a wide range of prescription drugs — it elicited appreciative reactions from acquaintances. “I take your products every day,” a number of them would offer; others would mention how a specific medicine had made all the difference to their health and would ask whether a more advanced treatment was in the works; some simply marveled at the industry’s innovations as nothing less than miracles. Then there were some who teased: “Good business; you can charge whatever price.” I considered the quip an acknowledgment that lifesaving discoveries were worth the money. Pharma Man, they called me. It seemed to confer a certain respectability, of the sort reserved for a physician or a scientist or a teacher. There was a presumption in it, too, that I lived by certain ideals and ethics demanded of such an avocation. I was proud of being a Pharma Man. Alas, I have now slipped precipitously in their eyes. I am seen as an avaricious man inexorably exploiting the misery of fellow human beings for profit — by inventing one new magic potion after another for which they cannot afford not to pay my price, because the only alternative would be pain and suffering, even death. My onetime champions have grudgingly tolerated this collective subjugation for years. But not anymore. Their festering anger has now broken into an open rebellion against the Pharma Man, the benevolent oppressor. The recent murder of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood, a heinous and deplorable expression of this growing rebellion, cannot be condoned in any way. But the health care landscape is littered with provocations against the Pharma Man which play out daily on national television, in the newspapers, and on social media. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The Pharma Man’s reputation is only going to get worse as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and tries to fulfill his promise to bring down drug prices. And there is the specter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. bringing his unconventional ideas to American health care in the new Trump administration; he has already publicly called for capping drug prices. Ironically, it had been the Democrats who made the industry — a financial hotbed of Republican support — a whipping boy in blaming America’s failure to deliver affordable health care to its citizens. But Mr. Trump has outshouted them all. He famously declared that pharma companies were “getting away with murder” and singled out Pfizer Inc. and publicly shamed the company and forced the CEO to roll back planned price increases. As I watched Mr. Trump tower over the CEO at a White House appearance and later triumphantly declare the result of his disciplinary action, I was reminded of my school days when the headmaster would hoist a student by the collar to make the truant admit culpability in front of the class. It was humiliating for the Pharma Man, for I once worked at the company, proud of its pioneering history and its roster of some of the world’s most impactful medicines, a company that would go on to save millions of lives with its Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic. But the Pharma Man has earned this new reputation, and then some. Nothing has been as devastating to the industry’s image as the ongoing opioid crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because companies capriciously pushed sales of the addictive painkillers. The bribing of doctors with cash and sex to prescribe the drugs, widely reported in the media, revealed to the American public the means and the measure of the Pharma Man’s extraordinary avarice. Although much of the hostility is focused on Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, a number of pharma companies with household names, among them Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, have been named in government investigations for directly or indirectly participating in perpetrating the opioid crisis. This follows a string of well-publicized, similar cases in which drug companies have been ostracized for their single-minded devotion to profit. Related Content Trump Moves Inauguration Circus Indoors, Citing Freezing Weather ‘Absolutely Clueless’: Tammy Duckworth Blasts Pete Hegseth and Senate GOP Trump Taps Voight, Gibson, Stallone as Special Ambassadors to ‘Bring Back’ Hollywood Trump’s Billionaire Treasury Pick Stresses Importance of Tax Cuts for Billionaires In 2016, millions of television viewers must have felt sick to their stomachs listening to the CEO of Mylan admitting to lawmakers that the company had jacked up the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving treatment for allergic reaction, by 400 percent, because it could in the absence of any competition. The same year, in another congressional hearing, Martin Shkreli, the brash CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the moniker “Bad Boy of Pharma” in the media as he mocked lawmakers and refused to answer when asked why his company had raised prices of decades-old drugs a whopping 5,000 percent. As these very public spectacles played out on national television, they reinforced the perception of millions of Americans who struggle daily with filling their prescriptions and securing coverage from their health insurers, that they are dealing with the devil. I work in a business that’s a highly sophisticated, science-driven enterprise, peopled by brilliant minds, who truly take special pride in what they do. They are not given to making sanctimonious claims that they wake up every morning to save the world — as their companies might in their corporate banners (“Your life is our life’s work”; “Your health is our mission”) — but in their subconscious lurks a deep sense of satisfaction, even joy, that their work ends up easing pain and suffering and saving lives. They see palpable evidence every day in their family members and friends who take the medicines they help bring to the world. But you would never know all this from their public reputation. In annual Gallup polls, the Pharma Man’s business consistently ranks at the very bottom of all industries in public trust, and even in that dishonorable position it slipped further in 2023. Professionally, the Pharma Man ranks below the car salesman for honesty and ethics. It is baffling to me that we as an industry haven’t stepped out in front of the groundswell of national outrage and undertaken systemic changes to our business practices. We continue to conduct our business on the strength of our power over our customers, a power we derive from our possession of the inventions that prevent and treat and cure and which our customers cannot do without. That’s like possessing Tolkien’s One Ring, which gives the possessor unassailable power to rule over and dominate others. We set the price we want. We can cast our spell on doctors to prescribe our medicine and do our bidding. We can banish competitors who attempt to lay claim to our Ring of Power. We have institutionalized this leverage in our business, all the way from drug discovery and development to marketing and sales and distribution. This underpinning of the industry’s colossal machinery is rigged against the patient. No one in the leadership of the pharma industry has raised a voice, let alone stepped up to act, to alter this unfair state endured by their very own customers; it seems there are no hobbits in the industry ready to undertake the treacherous journey to Mount Doom in a quest to destroy the Ring. We refuse to see how our customers see our business. In their minds, we owe our existence to their misfortunes and mishaps: the unexpected cancer, the heart that suddenly fails, the pancreas that fails to produce enough insulin. Our customers turn to us to help them deal with these events of life and living. Although they know it takes a lot of money and time to come up with a treatment, they also expect the pharma company to make it available to them at an affordable price. After all, they argue, axiomatically, the drug was specifically developed to serve their need, brought on by their unfortunate luck. They volunteer in tens of thousands, sick and healthy, for a new drug to be tested on them so the company can prove it works and is safe; some can die from the potential side effects. They are the ones who help create the market for the drug. And to dangle it in front of them but out of their reach by charging unaffordable prices is unconscionable. It is hard to argue against that view: the symbiotic existence between our enterprise and our customers imposes a business — not to mention a moral — obligation on us to make the drug affordable to the patient who was instrumental in the development of the treatment in the first place. We also should not ignore the fact that the U.S. government helps out drug development with taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, our customers cannot rely on market forces for what the pharma companies won’t offer: a fair deal. Car companies, with their zillion features, battle among themselves to win over customers, and any and all of their cars, irrespective of their features, deliver the same result: transporting the buyer from one place to another. One can purchase any smartphone on the market and it will make the call, send messages, browse the web. But when it comes to drugs, the consumer doesn’t necessarily have alternative choices. Take, for instance, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins. Among the seven or so statins developed so far, the most prescribed ones are atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor). Each statin has its own distinct efficacy and side effects, even though they all lower cholesterol. Physicians prescribe one statin or another based on patient condition and the desired outcome. In effect, the market of cholesterol-lowering agents gets divided into distinct segments of therapy, each offering just one single statin. Within each segment there is no competition to speak of (until the patent expires, allowing the entry of copies of the product, the so-called generics). Although the manufacturers compete with their sales and marketing campaigns to recruit patients to their respective statins, this sort of “competition” doesn’t significantly influence the price, as each product is viewed as distinct and un-substitutable, something that the manufacturers take pains to establish with their scientific papers and promotional materials. We are known to shamelessly exploit these monopolistic powers. When we lose a patent on a drug, we pay off competitors to keep them from entering the market. (The Federal Trade Commission estimates that these anticompetitive tactics cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in higher drug costs every year.) Most commonly, we tend to extend patents with minor variations on the original drug, such as a new coating or a slight change in the formulation — this is called evergreening — which offer little or no additional benefits to the patient. (Some 78 percent of the patented drugs marketed between 2005 and 2015 are not new drugs, according to a study published in the Journal of the Law and the Biosciences in December 2018.) Some of our tactics are simply mean. An example: An innovator company that had been selling a medicine in 20- and 40-milligram tablets retired the products once their patents expired and then relaunched only the 40-mg tablet with a score mark in the center. The indented mark would allow the tablet to be evenly split into two halves. The innovator would then use its marketing muscle to corral physicians to endorse it as a single two-in-one pill: 40 mg, and 20 mg when it’s split in two. The two-in-one becomes the new fashion. A generic company that developed unscored tablets is suddenly out of luck; its products fall out of favor with the prescribing physicians, even though the innovator’s scored version offers no improvement in efficacy. We justify the constant push for ever more profit by pointing to the nature of our business. The pursuit of drug discovery and development is inherently risky; there is no other industry that takes on such enormous risks to bring a product to the market. In pharmaceuticals, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to the market, sometimes upwards of a billion or more. Most drugs in development don’t make it. And when a drug does make it, there is a mad rush to recover the investments, including the money lost in all the unsuccessful earlier attempts. The race is against the clock, before the drug’s patent expires, usually within 12 or 13 years after launch. Any thought of making the drug affordable is subsumed by the urgency of squeezing profit out of a drug, no matter how old. So the industry takes the stance that lifesaving discoveries come at a price — and the patient must pay for it. But our customers don’t believe us when we say drug costs are so high because of R&D costs. We do not publish independently audited numbers to substantiate our claims. R&D costs can be inflated by assigning high values to the intellectual and financial capital invested in the drug, for instance. What makes our customers even more skeptical is that we spend far more on marketing our products — those screaming ads on TV and in subways — which adds enormously to the drug’s cost, while strengthening our monopolistic hold on our products. A large truth is that our drug pricing is heavily influenced by our single-minded obsession with keeping our shareholders — not patients — happy. This is not unique to the pharma industry; delivering “shareholder value,” the appreciation of the company’s stock price, is an operational mantra of corporations across industries. Whatever earnest exercise a pharma company goes through to set drug prices based on R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and other costs, at the end of the day this is all swept aside by the pressures to achieve quarterly and annual sales and profit targets. Executives’ bonuses are tied to achieving these performance metrics, and their stock grants and options deliver additional riches when the company’s stock appreciates. The pressures to serve the shareholder have only intensified in the past decade as the health care industry has become a sought-after vehicle for investors for the safe and steady and stellar returns it offers. Pharmaceuticals’ net profit margins are in the range of 15 to 20 percent, compared to 4 to 9 percent for large non-drug companies. A single successful drug can generate billions of dollars in sales, some as much as $15 billion or more annually. Many of our single pills, if incorporated into a company, would rank among the Fortune 500 companies. Investors bet on our drugs long before they reach the market. They pore over scientific papers and decipher results of early-stage clinical trials of a drug with the zeal of a geologist prospecting for oil. They swarm medical and scientific conferences where the latest findings and opinions about a drug’s progress are presented. Living up to their expectations or, better yet, exceeding them becomes a high priority for companies setting their future financial performance targets. The patient is nowhere in the picture; few in executive suites agonize over whether to lower a price by 10 or 15 percent so many more patients can afford the drug. The concept of affordability is not an operational imperative in the business, largely because top executives rarely interact with customers — the patients — to be sensitized to their needs, their plight really. In the car and smartphone industries, senior executives go around shaking hands with their customers and host regular conventions to take the pulse of their customers’ desires. In pharmaceuticals, a typical CEO’s calendar is filled with meetings with Wall Street analysts and fund managers, and the job of interacting with the customer is left to prescribing physicians, whom sales reps regularly badger with sales pitches. But these prescribers we rely on to do our bidding with patients have lost public trust. The opioid crisis exposed a large number of doctors accepting bribes, as much as $100,000 a year, and sexual services to push sales. Although this is the most publicized example of corruption among doctors, there are many others that haven’t drawn much public attention. Nearly all Big Pharma companies have paid fines, some multiple times, to settle charges of bribing doctors. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay more than $2.2 billion in fines to settle charges that it had improperly promoted an antipsychotic drug; the government alleged that the company had paid “speaker fees to doctors to influence them to write prescriptions” and that its sales representatives “told these doctors that if they wanted to receive payments for speaking, they needed to increase” their prescriptions of the drug. In China, the world’s second-largest economy and the fastest-growing pharma market, the British drugmaker GSK paid a $499 million fine in 2014, and several top executives pleaded guilty for bribing doctors to promote company products; it was a headline-grabbing government investigation that revealed humiliating details about how the company used hundreds of travel agencies to entertain doctors in exotic places and to dispense cash to them and tried to influence regulatory authorities. Other big-name multinational pharma companies — including Novartis, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Pfizer — have also been snared in bribery investigations in China, and have paid fines. While these unethical practices in China, the world’s second-largest pharmaceutical market, have grabbed headlines, they go unnoticed in Asia and Africa. In the pharmaceutical industry, influence peddling goes much deeper, to the very core of its business — the research and development — unlike in any other industry. Companies recruit leading researchers and academics to guide them during drug development, and to publicly pronounce their expert opinions in medical journals once the drug is successfully launched to the public. As critical as this alliance is to the successful development of a drug, it is now widely questioned because of these influencers’ financial ties to pharmaceutical companies. ProPublica, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, has exposed several leading researchers and academics for accepting money from pharmaceutical companies which they didn’t disclose — or did so falsely — in connection with the scientific articles they published, some in prestigious journals like the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. Among the prominent researchers ProPublica cited was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the nation’s leading cancer institute; he bullishly pitched to the investment community a new cancer treatment being developed by Roche without disclosing his financial ties to the company. What’s worthy of note is that this nationally respected cancer researcher didn’t seem to care that investors thought the product was a dud, a product that Roche would eventually scrap. The ethics of the scientist, who resigned in 2018, didn’t stand in the way of the company’s zeal for commercial success with the product. But then it is not unusual for a pharmaceutical company to influence, even shape, what the medical influencers present about its endeavors to investors and the public at large. Unfortunately, this dark underbelly of the industry is exposed only when an enterprise like ProPublica steps in with the full force of its investigative resources. There is little government oversight today to effectively block the bias in medical practice that results from the financial ties of medical practitioners with the pharmaceutical companies. But there is a website devoted to exposing and shaming both parties. If you want to find out if your doctor is receiving any money — how much and for what — from a company whose drug he or she is prescribing to you, you can go to the website Dollars for Docs and type in the name of the doctor. The site is the brainchild of ProPublica. It brings to mind the comparison with the U.S. Justice Department’s National Sex Offender Registry for the identity and location of known sex offenders. In a world where doctors and researchers and medical academics all work as an army of influencers, the patient exists only as the customer to be influenced. It is a most peculiar aspect of our industry that we market our products to doctors (who help generate sales for us but don’t pay for the products) and we sell to our actual customers, the patients (who pay but have no control over the price they pay). Who decides the price? A very small group of wholesalers called pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), owned by large insurers — CVS Health (which owns Aetna), Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthCare — that have been accused of padding their own profits at the cost of the patients they insure. These middlemen buy drugs on behalf of government and private employers and insurance companies. They negotiate prices with the pharma companies. It may sound bewildering that the customers who pay for the drugs cannot negotiate directly with the manufacturers, unlike in the rest of the world. Even Medicare, the country’s largest health plan, covering 60 million Americans, can’t. In effect, the market forces of supply and demand — the backbone of all other commerce in America — are shielded from each other by the opaque wall of the middlemen. Imagine if the price of your car or a smartphone were negotiated by a handful of middlemen and you had no choice but to pay. Today, 44 percent of Americans are either uninsured or underinsured; a 2021 national survey estimated that 46 million people couldn’t afford quality health care. Such news fails to register as profoundly worrisome in the psyches of pharmaceutical executives, largely because they are shielded from the customer by the systemic structure of the industry. Reports in the morning papers of patients unable to buy a lifesaving drug — like the news of Americans with diabetes struggling to procure high-priced insulin — might as well be the day’s weather report to them. Stories of struggles from further afield, like distant corners of Asia and Africa, where patients die because they can’t afford a blood pressure or cancer medicine, have even less of a chance of stirring the collective conscience of the industry. I am often asked if I think drug prices are high, in the sense that they are unreasonable and exploitative. I’ve had difficulty answering the question in the past with a definitive yes or no, because many of the drugs have had such a profound impact in banishing diseases and prolonging healthy life. Their discovery didn’t come easy. I would respond that the prices reflected the cost of innovation, but that they could be lower. That conditional justification is harder to make these days. More than 80 percent of the prescription drugs sold in the U.S. are generics, copies of patent-expired drugs. As copies, they have very low development costs. Their main costs lie in raw materials and manufacturing. And that cost is a fraction of the price the consumer currently pays for generics. I should know, because I manufacture many of them. For instance, a box of 30 five-milligram tablets of amlodipine, one of the most prescribed blood pressure medications, costs less than 30 cents to manufacture, and retails for $7 to $8.90 online and in U.S. drugstores, ostensibly discounted from $20 to $30. Simvastatin, a commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering medication, costs less than 40 cents for a pack of 30 20-mg tablets; it sells at $7.87 to $22.28, discounted from $12 to $30. Even after adding the cost of marketing and distribution, the selling prices of these drugs are astronomical. The consulting firm Pharmacy Benefit Consultants, which provides prescription coverage services to private and government employers, says the average wholesale prices — before the drug is sold to the patient — have been rising at “shocking rates.” Between the beginning of 2017 and March of 2018, it reports, the average wholesale prices of 450 drugs increased by between 25 and 100 percent. They included sharp increases for branded drugs that lost patents many years ago, such as 19.8 to 31 percent for Zoloft, which lost its patent in 2006, and 31.1 percent for Lipitor, which lost its patent in 2011. IT IS TIME FOR US to step up and make ourselves accountable to our customers, or else it will inevitably be done for us, as President Joe Biden did by capping the cost of insulin for seniors last year. Or maybe Mr. Trump will dangle a CEO by the collar in front of a national audience and humiliate him and demand admission of guilt and price cuts. Meanwhile, many government actions are in the works to limit prices of drugs across the board. And more than two dozen states have filed legal actions against pharmaceutical companies to force them to disclose how they price their products. Unfortunately, the industry today lacks leaders who can respond to these threats by spearheading a systemic change in the business practices that have brought on such public wrath. The industry has not produced in recent history a single business leader with the acumen — let alone the vision — to strategically pursue profit without abandoning the concurrent obligation to serve the patient. A bottom-line focus leads to appointing an accountant at the helm, or a lawyer if the company is mired in legal challenges, or a scientist simply because the company lacks a robust product line. There is nothing wrong with such choices if the chosen leader can strategically manage the twin missions of a health care company: ensuring that most patients can buy the drug while pursuing profit to enable research for the next big cure. Alas, none has emerged we can hold up as an example. That is pathetic. Because the genesis of the modern pharma industry is anchored on the idea of delivering medicine at affordable costs. Inventors of insulin and antibiotics — the two most seminal discoveries in pharmaceuticals — refused to patent their inventions so everyone would have access to these lifesaving drugs at low costs. That mission seems not to have inspired the modern-day leaders in the slightest. There is no Henry Ford, Walter Chrysler, William Durant, Thomas Watson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, or Elon Musk in the pharma industry. Pharmaceutical company boards are stacked with renowned business leaders from other industries and leading academics and Nobel laureates, but it is not discernible to me what worldly difference these outsiders have made to the conduct of the industry, which year after year has come under attack from its own customers and whose rage is now boiling over. What might a visionary do if one were to burst onto the scene today? One can imagine a Michael Dell mass-producing drugs — like he did with his Dell computer — and selling them at reasonable prices and yet making a stellar profit by reaching a large number of customers. Henry Ford did that with the Model T; he didn’t lie awake thinking of how to make it exclusive; he pioneered mass production as a way of maximizing profit by reaching the greatest number of customers possible. Perhaps a visionary would create a low-cost, no-frills brand of the expensive patented drug — like Herb Keller’s low-budget airline — without compromising on efficacy and safety. A Jeff Bezos would recast the industry by tossing out the middlemen and corruptible medical professionals. A pioneer would slash prices of some of the newest lifesaving biologic drugs — cutting-edge medicines for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis — to make them affordable, and would have the savviness to negotiate with the government an extended period of patent protection. Perhaps a visionary would model himself or herself after Warren Buffett and invite thousands of those who buy the company’s products to a gathering and mingle with them over barbecue and the strumming of a banjo to celebrate life and inspire the company with the grateful voices of the customers. That would make the Pharma Man proud. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: 5 Explosive Dividend Growers To Put On Your Radar In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/01/14/5-explosive-dividend-growers-to-put-on-your-radar-in-2025/

Investment strategy: searching and locating money with a radar. These five stocks may deliver big dividend raises. I’m talking potential payout hikes starting at 20%. It’s possible that one of these firms doubles their dividend because, heck, they did that one year ago! How do I know? Gaudy dividend growth numbers are especially attractive because they often lead to big price gains. I call this dynamic the “dividend magnet.” The “magnet” effect is pretty straightforward: When a company not only grows its profits, but shares gobs of those earnings with stockholders as dividends, investors on the outside see both a sign of quality and the potential for income and buy in—driving the stock price higher for us! Chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) is a perfect example of this dividend magnet in action. Since its 2016 merger with Avago, Broadcom’s yield has spent most of its time below 4%, sometimes as low as 1%. Investors seeking high current yield alone would never have given AVGO a second look. But investors who saw the company’s dividend-growth potential dialed in bigtime profits! Investors who bought AVGO shares shortly after Broadcom and Avago merged, then held on through today, are currently collecting a wild 18% yield. If the headline dividend puts investors to sleep, consider the velocity of the payout. It’s possible a big raise—and subsequent price pop—is on the way. In the spirit of the dividend magnet, let’s discuss five companies that are due to deliver dividend hikes in the upcoming weeks. Recently these shareholder-friendly firms have gifted investors with generous raises between 20% and 178%. If history is ready to repeat, or at least rhyme, then let’s be ready. I love big hikes after years of stagnant payouts. A sudden dividend boost can reflect a sea change, whether that’s through organic growth or a sudden business add-on. Hence my interest in seeing that ADT Inc. (ADT), a provider of home and small-business security technology, announced in January 2024 that it would juice its payout by 57%—its first hike since initiating a dividend a couple months after its January 2018 IPO. ADT is in a curious situation. When Apollo spun the company off, ADT was saddled with nearly $10 billion in debt. The only meaningful cut it has made to that debt came in 2023, after ADT sold its commercial business to private equity for $1.6 billion. ADT’s debt now stands at $7.7 billion, which is still more than its $6.2 billion market cap. Interestingly, ADT’s resulting dividend action wasn’t a special dividend—a common move after a big sale—but a significant raise to its regular distribution. What ADT does next will be telling. Its payout ratio is an uber-safe 30%. And after operating in the red for most of its publicly traded life, ADT has strung together two years of positive earnings, and it’s expected to finish 2024 with a 43% pop in adjusted profits after shutting down its lagging solar division. But the company still has a pile of IOUs to whittle away, which could limit its dividend aggression. The first period to watch is late January—that’s when ADT announced its big hike last year. But historically, ADT announces dividends in late February or early March, alongside its Q4 and full-year earnings report. Scorpio Tankers (STNG) is a seaborne transportation company specializing in the shipping of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It currently boasts 102 vessels, including 14 Handymax vessels (35,000 and 48,000 deadweight tons), 49 Medium Range vessels (40,000 to 55,000 DWT) and 39 Long Range 2 vessels (105,000 to 115,000 DWT). Tanker and shipping stocks are among the most cyclical stocks we’ll ever come across, with operational results and stock prices as fickle as the sea. To wit, STNG has recorded net losses in five of the past 10 years—and it has still made about $900 million in profits during that time. That’s why most shipping stocks have extremely variable dividend programs. Which makes STNG’s more traditional regular dividend stand out. And that dividend has exploded, from 10 cents per share in February 2022, to 20 cents in February 2023, to 40 cents in February 2024. That’s two consecutive dividend doublers! But the reason I’m so interested in Scorpio’s February 2025 dividend announcement is a matter of timing. Scorpio started aggressively raising across 2023, first with the doubler to 20 cents, but then to 25 cents (May) and 35 cents (November). Scorpio’s February 2024 hike was “just” 14% from the prior quarter, and STNG has stayed put since then. In other words, the upcoming announcement could tell us whether Scorpio’s recent raises are more than a short-term flash in the pan. It certainly has room, at a payout ratio of less than 15% of 2024’s expected full-year earnings. Just be aware: Shareholders have been burned by Scorpio’s more rigid dividend program; the tanker firm slashed its dividend by 92% in 2017 in the midst of a multiyear downturn. Accounting for a 1-for-10 reverse split in 2019, the current distribution is only a third of what it was previously. Meritage Homes (MTH) is a mid-cap homebuilder that builds single-family attached and detached homes for first-time and first move-up buyers, primarily across the southern U.S., from California to the Carolinas. And like many homebuilders, it also provides mortgage, title, title insurance, and other housing-finance products to buyers of its homes. Regular readers will remember MTH in my 2024 roundup of new dividend programs. Meritage Homes came out of the gate swinging in early 2023, following both a big jump in profits for full-year 2022 and increased confidence that the Fed’s rate hikes would soon be coming to an end. (BofA says that for every 25 bps that the mortgage rate declines, as long as it’s under 7%, more than a million households are priced back into the housing market.) MTH’s profits declined in 2023, but it was still a strong year for the highly cyclical homebuilder, and in early 2024, it nearly tripled its dividend with a 178% boost to 75 cents per share quarterly. Of course, that distribution is now 37.5 cents per share by virtue of a 2-for-1 stock split at the start of 2025, which Meritage needed after a multiyear stock surge. That puts a massive target on Meritage’s next expected dividend announcement, which should come in mid-February. On the one hand, the pros see another respectable year from MTH, with profits climbing by mid-single digits, and MTH pays out less than 15% of profits as it is. On the other hand, a conservative hike (or no raise at all!) could signal anxiety over 2025’s outlook. Despite multiple Fed rate cuts, 30-year mortgage rates have climbed back to nearly 7%, rekindling worries about home affordability. As a result, MTH’s value has plunged by 30% since peaking in September 2024. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI) is an energy equipment and services company that provides transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as oilfield services companies, in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Most notably, it provides mesh frac sand—a “proppant” that props open the fractures created in the hydraulic fracturing process. Atlas Energy is another recent public listing that had its IPO in March 2023, then announced its first dividend (as a publicly traded company, but its sixth overall) just a couple months later. A quick look at just its payouts would indicate a generally rising regular dividend, but the reality is something much different. What we’re looking for in early February is any further indication that AESI has plans to be a rare quarterly dividend raiser. It’s a tough test—the company’s expected to finish 2024 with a 33% drop in profits to $1.03 per share, which would put its dividend coverage around 93%. But profits are estimated to nearly double in the year after, putting its coverage at a much more comfortable 50%—if Atlas management is confident about continued growth, it could signal that with yet another quarterly hike within its fully fixed dividend program. Penske Automotive Group (PAG) is an international automobile retailer that operates dealerships not just in the U.S., but also the U.K., Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan. These dealerships cover just about every international brand under the sun. PAG Brands It also boasts a thriving commercial-truck retail business across North America, and it distributes and retails commercial vehicles, power systems, engines, and more across Australia and New Zealand. In addition to all that, it owns roughly 29% of Penske Transportation Solutions, a North American transportation services, logistics, and supply-chain management services provider. Penske has an almost uninterrupted run of quarterly dividend hikes going back more than a decade—PAG did suspend its payout for two quarters in 2020, but resumed payouts that same year at the same level, then just went right back to raising and raising and raising. Penske’s dividend finished 2024 at $1.19 per share. That’s nearly double the 63 cents it started at in 2023! In fact, PAG actually accelerated as the year went on—its Q4 dividend hike was the largest year-over-year improvement of 2024. And that’s despite a largely down year that should see profits finish about 16% lower before bouncing back a little in 2025. For now, Penske’s quarterly dividend announcements are must-watch events for dividend growth investors. The next one should come in mid-January.

Title: Seattle's new $20 minimum wage claims 6th restaurant casualty since New Year

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/14/2025 5:39:51 AM PST by george76 The number of restaurants in the Emerald City could drop by up to 8% this year.. Seattle’s new $20 minimum wage for 2025 has caused a 6th restaurant to close since the new year. Pike Place Market bakery The Confectional closed on Sunday after 18 years in business. ... Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Seattle’s new $20 minimum wage for 2025 has caused a 6th restaurant to close since the new year. Pike Place Market bakery The Confectional closed on Sunday after 18 years in business. ... Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Full Content:
NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: NYSE:JPM) has revealed a series of executive role shifts following Daniel Pinto's decision to retire as President and Chief Operating Officer at the end of 2026. Pinto will step down from his current roles on June 30, 2025, and transition to Vice Chairman, where he will continue to advise CEO Jamie Dimon and other senior executives. Jennifer Piepszak, previously Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Commercial & Investment Bank (CIB), has been appointed as the new Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Piepszak will assume responsibility for Technology, Operations, Chief Administrative Office, Data & Analytics, Corporate Strategy, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. She will also oversee the firm's Global Corporate Centers in India and the Philippines. Doug Petno, formerly Co-head of Global Banking, is set to replace Piepszak as Co-CEO of the CIB, alongside Troy Rohrbaugh. John Simmons will step into Petno's previous position and join Filippo Gori as the new Co-head of Global Banking. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes will maintain their current roles as CEO of Consumer and Community Banking and CEO of Asset & Wealth Management, respectively. All Corporate functions will be jointly managed by Piepszak and Dimon. Jamie Dimon praised Pinto for his "exceptional job" and "outstanding stewardship" during his tenure, which spans over 40 years. Pinto expressed pride in the team and the company's achievements, committing to support JPMorgan Chase in the future. This executive reshuffle comes as the financial services firm continues to lead in various sectors, including investment banking and asset management. The company reported $4.2 trillion in assets and $346 billion in stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024, serving a broad spectrum of customers under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands.

The S&P 500 is close to erasing all the gains it notched since Donald Trump’s election victory. As of market close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.92% since Nov. 5 — the day Trump clinched a second term in the White House and set off a stock market rally. S&P 500 futures were up 0.27% early Tuesday, pointing to a potential bounce back after sinking 0.77% so far in January. But if the index continues to close lower through Inauguration Day next Monday, it could represent the worst performance for the S&P 500 between Election Day and a presidential inauguration since 2009, when Barack Obama first took office during the Great Recession, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group reported by CNBC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also pared back its post-election gains in recent weeks, and is now only 0.18% higher than Nov. 5. That index is down 0.85% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still up 3.52% since Election Day, although it has also seen some moderation in returns. A slump in tech stocks on Monday, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI), following new Biden administration rules governing the sale of AI chips, sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower. In 2025, the Nasdaq has also slumped 1.63%. Dow futures were up 115 points in pre-market trading Tuesday, while Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.33%. In the aftermath of the election, major U.S. indexes hit new records in a Trump-fueled market rally, with the Dow hitting 44,000 for the first time in its 128-year history and the S&P 500 crossing the 6,000 mark. Investors are also bracing for the start of fourth-quarter earnings, which will kick off Wednesday with major banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citibank (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). The December Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, is also set to be released Wednesday morning. Economic indicators will continue to have an outsized impact on trading as Wall Street prepares for fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Welcome back to the newsletter. We are changing things up, so expect to see at least two editions each week, with the occasional special edition. The newsletter will continue to live on Engadget.com too, but if you haven’t subscribed, you should do that. Next week, Samsung will reveal its next family of Galaxy phones. Not the foldables, no, but the traditional S series devices. Going on track record, we can expect to see three S25 devices: standard, Plus and Ultra. There’s unlikely to be a huge change to aesthetics, but we expect some subtle differences — rounded corners, flatter edges and (of course) thinner bezels. Inside, at least in the US, the S25 series will probably be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, designed for on-device generative AI. The chip promises 45 percent faster single- and multi-core performance while using 27 percent less power than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so it could improve battery life too. Some rumors suggest a Galaxy S25 Slim with a — you guessed it — slimmer design. It’s all very on trend. However, given the FCC certifications only appear to cover the usual trio of flagships, that device may not arrive until later in the year. (If at all.) Expect an awful lot of AI razzle-dazzle too. One rumor suggests the Galaxy S25 series will include “an AI Agent that provides personalized clothing suggestions and transport information,” even though Google and myriad third-party apps already fully service the latter. I’d put money on a laborious bragging segment from Samsung and its AI tricks — many of which will fall by the wayside. A request: Please steal the Pixel’s Add Me photo feature. We’ll be reporting live from Samsung’s first Unpacked event of 2025. Mark your calendar for January 22! — Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

In his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will be roughly 2 millimeters thinner than any other phone model. “It will have a base-level A19 chip and a single-lens camera system,” Gurman notes, and will serve “as a testing ground for future technologies.” A single-lens camera could be an intriguing decision now three sensors is the standard for Apple’s most premium phones.

Back in May 2024, the company rolled out a mobile app rife with bugs and missing features like alarms and sleep timers. Some customers even complained that entire speaker systems would no longer work after updating to the new app. Sonos’ stock price has fallen by around 13 percent since the app launched. Sonos laid off over 100 people in August as it tried to fix the software and revenue fell 16 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on September 28. Spence’s payout package includes $7,500 per month until June, a cash severance of $1.9 million and shares in Sonos. I aspire to screw up an app update. Continue reading. Meta appeared to block links to Pixelfed, a decentralized photo-sharing platform, on Facebook, according to users on both Bluesky and 404 Media. A small group of posts that linked to pixelfed.social was deleted, with Facebook’s Community Standards on spam used as a justification. There’s a bigger impetus for users to jettison Instagram: Meta just announced dramatic changes to how it plans to moderate speech on its platforms. The company is ending both its third-party fact-checking program and made changes to its Hateful Conduct policy last week. A Meta spokesperson said removing the posts to Pixelfed was a mistake, and they’d be reinstated. Continue reading.

Title: YieldMax™ Launches Its First Portfolio ETF The Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY)

Full Content:
January 14, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of its first YieldMax™ Portfolio Option Income ETF: YieldMax™ Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (NYSE Arca: LFGY) LFGY Overview LFGY is an actively managed ETF that seeks current income and capital appreciation via direct investments in a select portfolio of 15-30 crypto industry and technology (“Crypto”) companies. LFGY aims to generate current income through an options portfolio on Crypto companies and/or Crypto ETFs. LFGY Equity Portfolio LFGY seeks capital appreciation via direct investments in its portfolio of 15-30 Crypto companies. To enable LFGY to effectively implement its options strategies (see below), LFGY’s Adviser evaluates the liquidity of a potential company’s common stock and the liquidity of its options contracts. Any dividend paid by its Crypto companies will contribute to LFGY’s income generation. LFGY Options Portfolio LFGY seeks to generate current income primarily by writing (selling) options contracts on some or all of its Crypto companies. Depending on the Adviser’s outlook, it will select one or more options strategies that it believes will best provide LFGY with current income while generally also attempting to participate in a portion of the share price increases experienced by its Crypto companies. Further, depending on the Adviser’s assessment of one or more of the Crypto companies’ options contracts (e.g., they are insufficiently liquid or too costly), LFGY may employ options strategies on a Crypto ETF. By strategically entering and exiting options positions, the Adviser seeks to enhance LFGY's income potential. LFGY Distribution Schedule LFGY is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, LFGY aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, LFGY aims to make distributions on a weekly basis and its first weekly distribution is expected to be announced on January 22, 2025. Why Invest in LFGY? Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. 1 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 2 The Distribution per Share is the most recent such amount as of close on January 13, 2025. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund’s objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

What O'Reilly Learning Platform Usage Tells Us About Where the Industry Is Headed Welcome to our annual report on the usage of the OâReilly learning platform. Itâs been an exciting year, dominated by a constant stream of breakthroughs and announcements in AI, and complicated by industry-wide layoffs. Generative AI gets better and betterâbut that trend may be at an end. Now the ball is in the application developersâ court: Where, when, and how will AI be integrated into the applications we build and use every day? And if AI replaces the developers, who will be left to do the integration? Our data shows how our users are reacting to changes in the industry: Which skills do they need to brush up on? Which do they need to add? What do they need to know to do their day-to-day work? In short: Where have we been in the past year, and where are we going? We arenât concerned about AI taking away software developersâ jobs. Ever since the computer industry got started in the 1950s, software developers have built tools to help them write software. AI is just another tool, another link added to the end of that chain. Software developers are excited by tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other coding assistants that make them more productive. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Thatâs only one of the stories weâre following. Here are a few of the others: All of these trends have been impacted, if not driven, by AIâand that impact will continue in the coming year. Finally, some notes about methodology. Skip this paragraph if you want; we donât mind. This report is based on the use of OâReillyâs online learning platform from January 1, 2024, to September 30, 2024. Year-over-year comparisons are based on the same period in 2023. The data in each graph is based on OâReillyâs âunits viewedâ metric, which measures the actual use of each item on the platform. It accounts for different usage behavior for different media: text, courses, and quizzes. In each graph, the data is scaled so that the item with the greatest units viewed is 1. That means items within a graph are comparable to each other, but you canât compare an item in one graph to an item in another. And all percentages are reported with two significant digits. When we look at how our customers use the OâReilly learning platform, we always think in terms of skills. What skills are they trying to gain? And how are they trying to improve their knowledge? This year, one thread that we see across all of our platform is the importance of artificial intelligence. Itâs all about upskilling in the age of AI. It will surprise absolutely nobody that AI was the most active category in the past year. For the past two years, large models have dominated the news. That trend started with ChatGPT and its descendants, most recently GPT 4o1. But unlike 2022, when ChatGPT was the only show anyone cared about, we now have many contenders. Claude has emerged as a favorite among programmers. After a shaky start, Googleâs Gemini models have become solid performers. Llama has established itself as one of the top models and as the matriarch of a rich ecosystem of open1 models. Many of the open models can deliver acceptable performance when running on laptops and phones; some are even targeted at embedded devices. So what does our data show? First, interest in almost all of the top skills is up: From 2023 to 2024, Machine Learning grew 9.2%; Artificial Intelligence grew 190%; Natural Language Processing grew 39%; Generative AI grew 289%; AI Principles grew 386%; and Prompt Engineering grew 456%. Among the top topics, the most significant decline was for GPT itself, which dropped by 13%ânot a huge decline but certainly a significant one. Searches for GPT peaked in March 2023 and have been trending downward ever since, so our search data matches our usage data. Weâre used to seeing interest move from a more general high-level topic to specific skills as an industry sector matures, so this trend away from GPT in favor of more abstract, high-level topics is counterintuitive. But in context, itâs fairly clear what happened. For all practical purposes, GPT was the only game in town back in 2023. The situation is different now: Thereâs lots of competition. These other models donât yet show up significantly in search or usage data, but the users of our platform have figured out whatâs important: not learning about GPT or Claude or Gemini or Mistral but getting the background you need to make sense of any model. Discovering a workflow that fits your needs is important, and as Simon Willison points out, your ideal workflow may actually involve using several models. Recent models are all good, but they arenât all good in the same way. AI has had a great year, but will it continue to show gains in 2025? Or will it drop back, much as ChatGPT and GPT did? That depends on many factors. Gartner has generative AI slipping into the âtrough of disillusionmentââand whatever you think of the technologyâs promise, remember that the disillusionment is a sociological phenomenon, not a technical one, and that it happens because new technologies are overhyped. Regardless of generative AIâs long-term promise, we expect some disillusionment to set in, especially among those who havenât properly understood the technology or its capabilities. Prompt Engineering, which gained 456% from 2023 to 2024, stands out. A 456% gain isnât as surprising as it seems; after all, people only started talking about prompt engineering in 2023. Although âprompt engineeringâ was bandied about as a buzzword, it didnât become a skill that employers were looking for until late in 2023, if that. That may be an early warning signal for AI disillusionment. Searches for âprompt engineeringâ grew sharply in 2023 but appeared to decline slightly in 2024. Is that noise or signal? If disillusionment in Prompt Engineering sets in, weâll also see declines in higher-level topics like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Thereâs a different take on the future of prompt engineering. There have been a number of arguments that the need for prompt engineering is temporary. As generative AI improves, this line of reasoning contends, we will no longer need to write complex prompts that specify exactly what we want the AI to do and how to do it. Prompts will be less sensitive to exactly how theyâre worded; changing a word or two will no longer give a completely different result. Weâll no longer have to say âexplain it to me as if I were five years oldâ or provide several examples of how to solve a problem step-by-step. Some recent developments point in that direction. Several of the more advanced models have made the âexplain it to meâ prompts superfluous. OpenAIâs GPT 4o1 has been trained in a way that maximizes its problem-solving abilities, not just its ability to string together coherent words. At its best, it eliminates the need to write prompts that demonstrate how to solve the problem (a technique called few-shot prompting). At worst, it âdecidesâ on an inappropriate process, and itâs difficult to convince it to solve the problem a different way. Anthropicâs Claude has a new (beta) computer use feature that lets the model use browsers, shells, and other programs: It can click on links and buttons, select text, and do much more. (Google and OpenAI are reportedly working on similar features.) Enabling a model to use the computer in much the same way as a human appears to give it the ability to solve multistep problems on its own, with minimal description. Itâs a big step toward a future full of intelligent agents: linked AI systems that cooperate to solve complex problems. However, Anthropicâs documentation is full of warnings about serious security vulnerabilities that remain to be solved. Weâre thrilled that Anthropic has been forthright about these weaknesses. But still, while computer use may be a peek at the future, itâs not ready for prime time. AI will almost certainly slide into a trough of disillusionment; as Iâve said, the trough has more to do with sociology than with technology. But OpenAI and Anthropic are demonstrating important paths forward. Will these experiments bear fruit in the next year? Weâll see. Many skills associated with AI also showed solid gains. Use of content about Deep Learning is up 14%, Generative Models is up 26%, and GitHub Copilot is up 471%. Use of content about the major AI libraries was up slightly: PyTorch gained 6.9%, Keras increased 3.3%, and Scikit-Learn gained 1.7%. Usage of TensorFlow content declined 28%; its continued decline indicates that PyTorch has won the hearts and minds of AI developers. These gainsâparticularly Copilotâsâare impressive, but a more important story concerns two skills that came out of nowhere: Usage of content about LangChain is on a par with PyTorch, and RAG is on a par with Keras. Neither of these skills were in last yearâs report; in 2023, content usage for LangChain and RAG was minimal, largely because little content existed. Theyâve caught on because both LangChain and RAG are tools for building better applications on top of AI models. GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama arenât the end of the road. RAG lets you build applications that send private data to a model as part of the prompt, enabling the model to build answers from data that wasnât in its training set. This process has several important consequences: It minimizes the probability of error or âhallucinationâ; it makes it possible to attribute answers to the sources from which they came; and it often makes it possible to use a much smaller and more economical model. LangChain is the first of many frameworks for building AI agents. (OpenAI has Swarm; Google has an Agent Builder thatâs part of Vertex; Salesforce and other vendors also have offerings.) Agents are software that can plan and execute multistage actions, many of which are delegated to other AI models. Claudeâs computer use API is another facet of this trend, along with whatever products OpenAI and Google may be building. Saying that usage has increased 26 million percent isnât to the pointâbut realizing that LangChain has grown from near zero to a platform on a par with PyTorch is very much so. Agentic applications are certainly the next big trend within AI. Artificial intelligence relies heavily on what we used to call (and perhaps still call) data science. Building AI models requires data at unprecedented scale. Building applications with RAG requires a portfolio of data (company financials, customer data, data purchased from other sources) that can be used to build queries, and data scientists know how to work with data at scale. Therefore, itâs not surprising that Data Engineering skills showed a solid 29% increase from 2023 to 2024. SQL, the common language of all database work, is up 3.2%; Power BI was up 3.0%, along with the more general (and much smaller) topic Business Intelligence (up 5.0%). PostgreSQL is close to edging ahead of MySQL, with a 3.6% gain. Interest in Data Lake architectures rose 59%, while the much older Data Warehouse held steady, with a 0.3% decline. (In our skill taxonomy, Data Lake includes Data Lakehouse, a data storage architecture that combines features of data lakes and data warehouses.) Finally, ETL grew 102%. With the exception of ETL, the gains are smaller than the increases we saw for AI skills, but that makes sense: AI is an exciting new area, and data is a mature, stable category. The number of people who need specialized skills like ETL is relatively small but obviously growing as data storage becomes even more important with AI. Itâs worth understanding the connection between data engineering, data lakes, and data lakehouses. Data engineers build the infrastructure to collect, store, and analyze data. The data needed for an AI application almost always takes many forms: free-form text, images, audio, structured data (for example, financial statements), etc. Data often arrives in streams, asynchronously and more or less constantly. This is a good match for a data lake, which stores data regardless of structure for use later. Because data receives only minimal processing when it arrives, it can be stored in near real time; itâs cleaned and formatted in application-specific ways when itâs needed. Once data has been stored in a data lake, it can be used for traditional business analytics, stored in a vector or graph database for RAG, or put to almost any other use. A data lakehouse combines both structured and unstructured data in a single platform. What do software developers do all day? They write software. Programming is an important part of the job, but itâs not the whole thing; best estimates are that programmers spend roughly 20% of their time writing code. The rest of their time is spent understanding the problems theyâre being asked to solve, designing appropriate solutions, documenting their work, updating management on the status of their projects, and much more. Software architecture, which focuses on understanding a customerâs requirements and designing systems to meet those requirements, is an important part of the overall software development picture. Itâs a skill to which many of our software developers and programmers aspire. This yearâs data shows that software architecture continues to be one of the most desirable skills in the industries we serve. Usage of material about Software Architecture rose 5.5% from 2023 to 2024, a small but significant increase. But itâs more important to ask why it increased. A position in software architecture may be perceived as more secure in a time of layoffs, and itâs often perceived as another step forward in a career that moves from junior programmer to senior to lead. In addition, the rise of AI presents many architectural challenges: Do we try to build our own model? (The answer is usually âno.â) Should we use an AI service provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, or Google, or should we fine-tune and host our own model on our own infrastructure? How do we build applications that are safe (and how do we define âsafeâ)? How do we evaluate performance? These questions all have a bearing on software architecture. Furthermore, AI might provide tools to help software architects, but so far, these tools can do little for the substance of the job: understanding customersâ needs and helping them define what they want to build. With AI in the picture, weâre all building new kinds of applicationsâand those applications require architects to help design them. In this context, itâs no surprise that Enterprise Architecture is up 17% and Distributed Systems is up 35%. Enterprise architecture is a staple: As Willie Sutton said about banks, âThatâs where the money is.â Itâs a good bet that many enterprises are trying to integrate AI into their systems or update legacy systems that are no longer scalable or maintainable. We can (and do) make the same argument about distributed systems. Modern enterprises work on a scale that was unimaginable a few decades ago. Scale isnât just for companies like Amazon and Google. To survive, even small businesses need to develop an online presenceâand that means building systems in the cloud that can handle surges in demand gracefully. It means building systems that can withstand outages. Distributed systems arenât just massive deployments with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Your business may only require a dozen nodes, but regardless of the scale, it still faces the architectural challenges that come with distributed systems. Some of the more significant ideas from the past decade seem to be falling out of favor. Microservices declined 24%, though content use is still substantial. Domain-Driven Design, which is an excellent skill for designing with microservices, is down 22%. Serverless is down 5%; this particular architectural style was widely hyped and seemed like a good match for microservices but never really caught on, at least based on our platformâs data. Whatâs happening? Microservice architectures are difficult to design and implement, and they arenât always appropriateâfrom the start, the best advice has been to begin by building a monolith, then break the monolith into microservices when it becomes unwieldy. By the time you reach that stage, youâll have a better feel for what microservices need to be broken out from the monolith. Thatâs good advice, but the hype got ahead of it. Many organizations that would never need the complexity of microservices were trying to implement them with underskilled staff. As an architectural style, microservices wonât disappear, but theyâre no longer getting the attention they once were. And new ideas, like modular monoliths, may catch on in the coming years; modularity is a virtue regardless of scale or complexity. Last yearâs report showed that our users were consuming less content about programming languages. This yearâs data continues that trend. We see a small drop for Python (5.3%) and a more significant drop for Java (13%). And even C++, which showed healthy growth from 2022 to 2023, is down 9% in 2024. On the other hand, C is up (1.3%), and so is C# (2.1%). Rust is up 9.6%. The small increases in C and C# may just be noise. C is well-entrenched and isnât going anywhere fast. Neither is C++, despite its drop. Rustâs increase continues a growth trend that stretches back several years; thatâs an important signal. Rust is clearly winning over developers, at least for new projects. Now that the US government is placing a priority on memory safety, Rustâs emphasis on memory safety serves it well. Rust isnât the first programming language to claim memory safety, nor will it be the last. (There are projects to add memory safety to C++, for example.) But right now, itâs the best positioned. Aside from Rust, though, we need to ask whatâs happening with programming skills. A few forces are applying downward pressure. Industry-wide layoffs may be playing a role. Weâve downplayed the effect of layoffs in the past, but we may have to admit that we were wrong: This year, they may be taking a bite out of skills development. Could generative AI have had an effect on the development of programming language skills? Itâs possible; shortly after GPT-3 was released, Simon Willison reported that he was learning Rust with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot, and more recently that heâs used Claude to write Rust code that he has in production, even though he doesnât consider himself a skilled Rust developer. It would be foolish to deny that generative AI will help programmers to become more productive. And it would be foolish to deny that AI will change how and what we learn. But we have to think carefully about what âlearningâ means, and why we learn in the first place. Programmers wonât have to remember all the little details of programming languagesâbut thatâs never been the important part of programming, nor has rote memorization been an important part of learning. Students will never have to remember a half dozen sorting algorithms, but computer science classes donât teach sorting algorithms because committing algorithms to memory is important. Every programming language has a sort() function somewhere in its libraries. No, sorting is taught because itâs a problem that everyone can understand and that can be solved in several different waysâand each solution has different properties (performance, memory use, etc.). The point is learning how to solve problems and understanding the properties of those solutions. As Claire Vo said in her episode of Generative AI in the Real World, weâll always need engineers who think like engineersâand thatâs what learning how to solve problems means. Whether lines end in a semicolon or a colon or whether you use curly braces, end statements, or tabs to delimit blocks of code is immaterial. The perception that generative AI minimizes the need to learn programming languages may limit the use of language-oriented content on our platform. Does that benefit the learners? If someone is using AI to avoid learning the hard conceptsâlike solving a problem by dividing it into smaller pieces (like quicksort)âthey are shortchanging themselves. Shortcuts rarely pay off in the long term; coding assistants may help you to write some useful code, but those who use them merely as shortcuts rather than as learning tools are missing the point. Unfortunately, the history of teachingâgoing back centuries if not millenniaâhas stressed memorization. Itâs time for both learners and teachers to grow beyond that. Learning is changing as a result of AI. The way we teach, and the way our users want to be taught, is changing. Building the right kind of experiences to facilitate learning in an AI-enabled environment is an ongoing project for our learning platform. In the future, will our users learn to program by completing AI-generated tutorials that are customized in real time to their needs and abilities? Thatâs where weâre headed. Use of content about web programming skills is down, with few exceptions. A number of factors might be contributing to this. First, I canât think of any significant new web frameworks in the past year; the field is still dominated by React (down 18%) and Angular (down 10%). There is some life near the bottom of the chart. The Svelte framework had significant growth (24%); so did Next.js (8.7%). But while these frameworks have their adherents, theyâre far from dominant. PHP (down 19%) still claims to have built the lionâs share of the web, but itâs not what developers reach for when they want to build something new, particularly if that ânewâ is a complex web application. The PHP world has been rocked by a bitter fight between the CEOs of Automattic (the developers of WordPress, by far the most important PHP framework) and WP Engine (a WordPress hosting platform). That fight started too late to affect this yearâs results significantly, but it might weigh heavily next year. A more significant development has been the movement away from complex platforms and back toward the simplicity of the earlier web. Alex Russellâs âReckoningâ posts summarize many of the problems. Our networks and our computers are much, much faster than they were 20 or 25 years ago, but web performance hasnât improved noticeably. If anything, itâs gotten worse. We still wait for applications to load. Applications are hard to develop and have gotten harder over the years. There are several new frameworks that may (or may not) be lighter-weight, such as HTMX, Ludic, Glitch, and Cobalt. None of them have yet made a dent in our data, in part because none have built enough of a following for publishers and trainers to develop contentâand you canât have any units viewed if there isnât anything to view. However, if you want an experience that isnât dominated by heavyweight frameworks, doesnât require you to become a JavaScript expert, and puts the fun back into building the web, this is where to look. Web dev is a discipline that has been ill-served by shortcuts to learning. We hear too often about boot camp graduates who know a few React tricks but donât understand the difference between React and JavaScript (or even know that JavaScript exists, let alone other programming languages). These programmers are very likely to lose their jobs to AI, which can already reproduce all the basic React techniques theyâve learned. Learning providers need to think about how AI is changing the workplace and how their students can partner with AI to build something beyond what AI can build on its own. Part of the solution is certainly a return to basics, ensuring that junior developers understand the tools with which theyâre working. Operations is another area where the trends are mostly downward. It may be small consolation, but the drops for several of the most important topics are relatively small: Linux is down 1.6%, Terraform is down 4.0%, and Infrastructure as Code is down 7.3%. As a skill, Terraform seems little hurt by the fork of Terraform that created the open source OpenTofu project, perhaps because the OpenTofu developers have been careful to maintain compatibility with Terraform. How this split plays out in the future is an open question. Itâs worth noting the precipitous drop in Terraform certification (down 43%); that may be a more important signal than Terraform itself. Kubernetes is down 20%. Despite that drop, which is sharper than last yearâs 6.9% decrease, content teaching Kubernetes skills remains the second most widely used group in this category, and Kubernetes certification is up 6.3%. Last year, we said that Kubernetes needed to be simpler. It isnât. There are no viable alternatives to Kubernetes yet, but there are different ways to deploy it. Kubernetes as a service managed by a cloud provider is certainly catching on, putting the burden of understanding every detail of Kubernetesâs operation on the shoulders of the provider. We also pointed to the rise of developer platforms; this year, the buzzword is âplatform engineeringâ (Camille Fournier and Ian Nowlandâs book is excellent), but as far as Kubernetes is concerned, itâs the same thing. Platform engineers can abstract knowledge of Kubernetes into a platform, minimizing software developersâ cognitive overhead. The result is that the number of people who need to know about Kubernetes is smaller. Both DevOps (down 23%) and SRE (down 15%) dropped. Thereâs certainly some frustration with DevOps: Has it paid off? We ask a different question: Has it ever been tried? One problem with DevOps (which it shares with Agile) is that many companies âadoptedâ it in name but not in essence. They renamed a few positions, hired a few DevOps engineers, maybe created a DevOps group, never realizing that DevOps wasnât about new job titles or new specialties; it was about reducing the friction between software development teams and operations teams. When you look at it this way, creating new groups and hiring new specialists can only be counterproductive. And the result is predictable: You donât have to look far to find blogs and whitepapers claiming that DevOps doesnât work. Thereâs also frustration with ideas like âshift leftâ and DevSecOps, which envision taking security into account from the start of the development process. Security is a different discussion, but itâs unclear how you build secure systems without taking it into account from the start. Weâve spent several decades building software and trying to fold security in at the last minuteâwe know how well that works. In any case, the industry has moved on. Platform engineering is, in many ways, a natural outgrowth of both DevOps and SRE. As Iâve argued, the course of operations has been to increase the ratio of computers to operators. Is platform engineering the next step, allowing software developers to build systems that can handle their own deployment and routine operations without the help of operations staff? General IT certifications, apart from security, trended downward. Use of content to prepare for the CompTIA A+ exam, an entry-level IT certification, was down 15%; CompTIA Network+ was down 7.9%. CompTIAâs Linux+ exam held its own, with a decline of 0.3%. On our platform, weâve seen that Linux resources are in high demand. The slight decline for Linux-related content (1.6%) fits with the very small decrease in Linux+ certification. For many years, Ciscoâs certifications have been the gold standard for IT. Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), a fairly general entry-level IT certification, showed the greatest usage and the smallest decline (2.2%). Usage of content to prepare for the Cisco Certified Network Practitioner (CCNP) exams, a cluster of related certifications on topics like enterprise networking, data centers, and security, dropped 17%. The Cisco Certified Internet Engineer (CCIE) exams showed the greatest decline (36%). CCIE has long been recognized as the most comprehensive and in-depth IT certification. Weâre not surprised that the total usage of this content is relatively small. CCIE represents the climax of a career, not the start. The number of people who attain it is relatively small, and those who do often include their CCIE number with their credentials. But the drop is surprising. Itâs certainly true that IT is less focused on heavy-duty routing and switching for on-prem data centers (or even smaller machine rooms) than it was a few years ago. That work has largely been offloaded to cloud providers. While routers and switches havenât disappeared, IT doesnât need to support as wide a range of resources: They need to support office WiFi, some databases that need to remain on-premises, and maybe a few servers for office-related tasks. Theyâre very concerned about security, and as weâll see shortly, security certifications are thriving. Is it possible that Cisco and its certifications arenât as relevant as they used to be? As we mentioned above, we also saw a drop in the relatively new certification for HashiCorpâs Terraform (43%). Thatâs a sharp declineâparticularly since use of content about Terraform itself only declined 4.0%, showing that Terraform skills remain highly desirable regardless of the certification. A sudden drop in certification prep can be caused by a new exam, making older content out-of-date, but that isnât the case here. Terraform certification certainly wasnât helped by HashiCorpâs switch to a Business Source License or the subsequent fork of the Terraform project. IBMâs pending acquisition of Terraform (set to close before the end of 2024) may have introduced more uncertainty. Is the decline in interest for Terraform certification an indicator of dissatisfaction in the Terraform community? The Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA, up 6.3%) was a bright spot in IT certification. Whether or not Kubernetes is overly complex (perhaps because itâs overly complex) and whether or not companies are moving out of the cloud, KCNA certification is a worthwhile asset. Cloud native applications arenât going away. And whether theyâre managing Kubernetes complexity by building developer platforms, using a Kubernetes provider, or using some other solution, companies will need people on their staff who can demonstrate that they have Kubernetes skills. Content use for the major cloud providers and their certifications was down across all categories, with one exception: Use of content to prepare for Google Cloud certifications is up 2.2%. What does that tell us, if anything? Are we looking at a âcloud repatriationâ movement in full swing? Are our customers moving their operations back from the cloud to on-prem (or hosted) data centers? Last year, we said that we see very little evidence that repatriation is happening. This year? An article in The New Stack argues that cloud repatriation is gathering steam. While that might account for the decline in the use of cloud-related content, we still see little evidence that repatriation is actually happening. Two case studies (37signals and GEICO) donât make a trend. The ongoing expense of operating software in the cloud probably is greater than the cost of running it on-premises. But the cloud allows for scaling on demand, and thatâs important. Itâs true, few businesses have the sudden usage peaks that are driven by events like retailâs Black Friday. But the cloud providers arenât just about sudden 10x or 100x bursts of traffic; they also allow you to scale smoothly from 1x to 1.5x to 2x to 3x, and so on. It saves you from arguing that you need additional infrastructure until the need becomes a crisis, at which point, you donât need to grow 1.5x; you need 5x. After moving operations to the cloud and experiencing a few years of growthâeven if that growth is moderateâmoving back to an on-premises data center will require significant capital expense. It will probably require gutting all the infrastructure that you havenât been using for the past year and replacing it with something up-to-date. Does this mean that cloud providers are âroach motels,â where you can move in but you canât move out? Thatâs not entirely untrue. But the ease of scaling by allocating a few more servers and seeing a slightly higher bill the next month canât be ignored, even if those slightly higher bills sound like the proverbial story of boiling the frog. Evaluating vendors, waiting for delivery, installing hardware, configuring hardware, testing hardwareâthatâs effort and expense that businesses are offloading to cloud vendors. The ability to scale fluidly is particularly important in the age of AI. Few companies have the skills needed to build on-premises infrastructure for AI, with its cooling and power requirements. That means either buying AI services directly from cloud providers or building infrastructure to host your own models. And of course, the cloud providers have plenty of help for companies that need to use their high-end GPUs. (Seriouslyâif you want to host your AI application on-premises, see how long it will take to get delivery of NVIDIAâs latest GPU.) The reality, as IDC concluded in a survey of cloud use, is that âworkload repatriation from public cloud into dedicated environments goes hand in hand with workload migration to public cloud activities, reflecting organizationsâ continuous reassessment of IT environments best suited for serving their workloads.â That is, thereâs a constant ebb and flow of workloads to and from public clouds as companies adapt their strategies to the business environment. The buzzword power of âthe cloudâ lasted longer than anyone could reasonably have expected, but itâs dead now. However, thatâs just the buzzword. Companies may no longer be âmoving to the cloudâ; that move has already happened, and their staff no longer need to learn how to do it. Organizations now need to learn how to manage the investments theyâve made. They need to learn which workloads are most appropriate for the cloud and which are better run on-premises. IT still needs staff with cloud skills. Security Governance drove the most content use in 2024, growing 7.3% in the process and overtaking Network Security (down 12%). The rise of governance is an important sign: âSecurityâ is no longer an ad hoc issue, fixing vulnerabilities in individual applications or specific services. That approach leads to endless firefighting and eventually failureâand those failures end up in the major news media and result in executives losing their jobs. Security is a company-wide issue that needs to be addressed in every part of the organization. Confirming the growing importance of security governance, interest in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) grew 44%, and Compliance grew 10%. Both are key parts of security governance. Security architecture also showed a small but significant increase (3.7%); designing a security architecture that works for an entire organization is an important part of looking at the overall security picture. The use of content about Application Security also grew significantly (17%). Thatâs a very general topic, and it perhaps doesnât say much except that our users are interested in securing their applicationsâwhich goes without saying. But what kinds of applications? All of them: web applications, cloud applications, business intelligence applications, everything. We get a bigger signal from the increase in Zero Trust (13%), a particularly important strategy for securing services in which every user, human or otherwise, must authenticate itself to every service that it uses. In addition, users must have appropriate privileges to do what they need to do, and no more. Itâs particularly important that zero trust extends authentication to nonhuman users (other computers and other services, whether internal or external). Itâs a response to the âhard, crunchy outside, but soft chewy insideâ security that dominated the 1990s and early 2000s. Zero trust assumes that attackers can get through firewalls, that they can guess passwords, and that they can compromise phones and computers when theyâre outside the firewall. Firewalls, good passwords, and multifactor authentication systems are all importantâtheyâre the hard, crunchy outside that prevents an attacker from getting in. Zero trust helps keep attackers outside, of courseâbut more than that, it limits the damage they can do once theyâre inside. Weâre puzzled by the drop in use of content about Network Security, which corresponds roughly to the drop in Cisco certifications. Network Security is still the second most widely used skill, but itâs down 12% from 2023 to 2024. Perhaps network security isnât deemed as important when employees wander in and out of company networks and applications are distributed between in-house servers and the cloud. We hope that our users arenât making that mistake. A bigger issue is that networks havenât changed much in the past few years: Weâre still using IPv4; weâre still using routers, switches, and firewalls, none of which have changed significantly in recent years. What has changed is the way security is implemented. Cloud computing and zero trust have moved the focus from big-iron networking devices to interactions between systems, regardless of how they are connected. Security certification has been one of the biggest growth areas on our platform. As Iâve said elsewhere, security professionals love their certifications. Thereâs a good reason for that. In most other specialties, itâs possible to build a portfolio of programs you wrote, systems you architected, sites youâve designed. What can a security person say in a job interview? âI stopped 10,000 people from logging in last year?â If youâve ever monitored a public-facing Linux system, you know that claim means little. Security is cursed with the problem that the best news is no news: âNothing bad happenedâ doesnât play well with management or future employers. Neither does âI kept all the software patched, and spent time reading CVEs to learn about new vulnerabilitiesââeven though thatâs an excellent demonstration of competence. Certification is a way of proving that you have certain skills and that youâve met some widely recognized standards. The CISSP (up 11%) and CompTIA Security+ (up 13%) certifications are always at the top of our lists, and this year is no exception. Our State of Security in 2024 report showed that CISSP was the certification most commonly required by employers. If thereâs a gold standard for security skills, CISSP is it: Itâs a thorough, comprehensive exam for people with more than five years of experience. CompTIA Security+ certification has always trailed CISSP slightly in our surveys and in platform performance, but its position in second place is uncontested. Security+ is an entry-level certification; itâs particularly desirable for people who are starting their security careers. Security certification was especially important for government users. For most industry sectors, usage focused on programming skills in Java or Python, followed by artificial intelligence. The government sector was a strong outlier. Security and IT certifications were by far the most important topics. CompTIA Security+ and CISSP (in that order) led. Moving beyond CISSP and Security+, many of the other security certifications also showed gains. Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) was up 1.4%, as was the less popular CompTIA PenTest+ certification (3.3%). Certified Cloud Security Professional was up 2.4%, somewhat less than weâd expect, given the importance of the cloud to modern IT, but itâs still a gain. ISACAâs Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) was up 45%, Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) grew 9.3%, and Certified Information Security Auditor (CISA) was up 8.8%; these three certifications are strongly associated with security governance. The most significant declines were for the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification (down 13%) and CCNA Security (down 55%). The drop in CCNA Security is extreme, but it isnât unexpected given that none of the Cisco certifications showed an increase this year. Weâre missing one important piece of the security certification puzzle. Thereâs no data on AI security certificationsâand thatâs because there arenât any. Software that incorporates AI must be built and operated securely. That will require security experts with AI expertise (and who can demonstrate that expertise via certifications). We expect (or maybe a better phrase is âwe hopeâ) that lack will be addressed in the coming year. Professional development continues to be an important growth area for our audience. The most important skill, Professional Communication, grew 4.5%ânot much but significant. We saw a 9.6% increase in users wanting to know more about Engineering Leadership, and a 21.5% increase in users using content about Personal Productivity. Project Management was almost unchanged from 2023 to 2024 (up 0.01%), while the use of content about the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification grew 15%. Interest in Product Management declined 11%; it seems to be a skill that our users are less interested in. Why? For the past few years, product manager has seemed to be a trendy new job title. But in last yearâs report, Product Management only showed a small gain from 2022 to 2023. Is interest in Product Management as a skill or as a job title fading? We also saw a 7.9% decline in Leadership (aside from Engineering Leadership), and a huge 35% decline for IT Management. Are we to blame these on the corporate layoff cycle? Thatâs possible, but itâs too easy. IT may be affected by a general trend toward simplification and platform engineering, as weâve discussed: A platform engineering group can do a lot to reduce cognitive overhead for developers, but it also reduces the need for IT staff. A platform engineering group doesnât have to be large; is the need for IT staff shrinking? The decline in Leadership may be because itâs a vague, nonspecific term, unlike Engineering Leadership (which is up). Engineering Leadership is concrete and itâs something our engineering-oriented audience understands. In 2024, we introduced several new features on the OâReilly learning platform, including badges, quizzes, and a new version of OâReilly Answers. What are they telling us? We started a badging program late in 2023: Users from business accounts can earn badges for taking courses and completing quizzes. We wonât go into the program details here, but since the program started, users have earned nearly 160,000 badges. Weâre still building the program, but weâre encouraged by its first year. Badges can give us more insight into what our users are learning. The most popular badges are for Python skills, followed by GPT and prompt engineering. Generative AI and machine learning are also high on the list. Kubernetes, despite its decline in units viewed, was the fourth-most-frequently-acquired badge, with almost the same number of badges earned as software architecture. Linux, SQL, professional communication, and Java rounded out the top 11. (Yes, 11âwe wanted to include Java). The difference between Java and Python is striking, given that the use of content about these skills is similar. (Python leads Java, but not by much.) Oracle has a highly regarded Java certification program, and thereâs really no equivalent for Python. Perhaps our users recognize that obtaining a Java badge is superfluous, while obtaining badges for Pythonic skills is meaningful? Quizzes are closely tied to badges: If a final quiz exists for a course or for a book, students must pass it to earn their badge. Quiz usage appears to follow the same trends as badging, though itâs premature to draw any conclusions. While a few legacy quizzes have been on the platform for a long time (and arenât connected to badging), the push to develop quizzes as part of the badging program only began in June 2024, and quiz usage is still as much a consequence of the time the quiz has been available on the platform as it is of the skill for which itâs testing. We can also look at the expertise required by the badges that were earned. All of our content is tagged with a skill level: beginner, beginner-intermediate, intermediate, intermediate-advanced, or advanced. 42% of the badges were earned for content judged to be intermediate. 33% of the badges were earned for beginner content, while only 4.4% were for advanced content. Itâs somewhat surprising that most of the badges were earned for intermediate-level content, though perhaps that makes sense given the badge programâs B2B context: For the most part, our users are professionals rather than beginners. One of our most important new features in 2024 was an upgrade to OâReilly Answers. Answers is a generative AI-powered tool that allows users to enter natural language questions and generates responses from content in our platform. Unlike most other generative AI products, Answers always provides links to the original sources its responses are based on. These citations are tracked and used to calculate author royalties and payments to publishing partners. So the obvious question is: What are our users asking? One might guess that the questions in Answers would be similar to the search terms used on the platform. (At this point, Answers and search are distinct from each other.) That guess is partly rightâand partly wrong. There are some obvious differences. Common search terms include book titles, author names, and even ISBNs; titles and author names rarely appear in Answers. The most common searches are for single words, such as âPythonâ or âJava.â (The average length of the top 5,000 searches in September 2024 was two words, for instance.) There are few single word questions in Answers (though there are some); most questions are well-formed sentences like âHow many ways can you create a string object in Java?â (The average question length was nine words.) To analyze the questions from OâReilly Answers, we essentially turned them back into single-word questions. First, we eliminated questions from a âquestion bankâ that we created to prime the pump, as it were: Rather than requiring users to write a new question, we offered a list of prewritten queries they could click on. While thereâs undoubtedly some useful signal in how the question bank was used, we were more interested in what users asked of their own volition. From the user-written questions, we created a big âbag of words,â sorted them by frequency, and eliminated stopwords. We included a lot of stopwords that arenât in most lists: words like âdataâ (what does that mean by itself?) and âchapterâ (yes, you can ask about a chapter in a book, but that doesnât tell us much). With that background in mind, what were the most common words in Answers and in searches? In order: Thereâs an obvious difference between these two lists. The Answers list consists mostly of words that could be part of longer questions. The Search list is made up of topics and skills about which one might want information. Thatâs hardly surprising or insightful. Weâve said most searches on the platform are single-word searches, which means that those words have to be stand-alone skills or topics, like Python or Java. Likewise, Answers was built to allow users to ask more detailed, in-depth questions and get focused answers from the content on our platformâso rather than seeing single word searches, weâre seeing common words from longer questions. Maybe thatâs a self-fulfilling prophecy, but itâs also showing that Answers is working the way we intended. Thereâs a little more signal here. Python and Java are the two top programming languages on both lists, but if we look at search queries, machine learning and Kubernetes are sandwiched between the two languages. That may just be a result of our usersâ experiences with services like ChatGPT. Programmers quickly learned that they can get reasonable answers to questions about Java and Python, and the prompts donât have to be very complex. My personal favorite is âHow do you flatten a list of lists in Python?,â which can be answered by most chatbots correctly but isnât meaningful to our search engine. Kubernetes raises a different question: Why is it the third-most-common search engine query but doesnât appear among the top words on Answers? (Itâs the 90th-most-common word on Answers, though the actual rank isnât meaningful.) While Kubernetes is a topic thatâs amenable to precise questions, itâs a complex tool, and coming up with precise prompts is difficult; writing a good question probably requires a good understanding of your IT infrastructure. You might need to understand how to solve your problem before you can ask a good question about how to solve your problem. A search engine doesnât face problems like this. It doesnât need additional information to return a list of resources. Then what about words like Rust and Linux, which are high on the list of common searches, but not in the top 13 for Answers? Itâs relatively easy to come up with specific questions about either of theseâor, for that matter, about SQL, AWS, or React. SQL, AWS, and Linux are reasonably close to the top of the Answers word list. If we just concern ourselves with the order in which words appear, things start to fall into place: AWS (and cloud) follow learning; they are followed by Linux, followed by SQL. Weâre not surprised that there are few questions about CISSP on Answers; itâs a certification exam, so users are more likely to want test prep material than to ask specific questions. Rust and React are still outliers, though; itâs easy to ask precise and specific questions about either of them. Rust is still unfamiliar to many of our usersâcould the explanation be that our customers want to learn Rust as a whole rather than ask specific questions that might only occur to someone whoâs already learned the language? But if you accept that, React still remains an outlier. We may know the answers next year, at which time weâll have a much longer track record with Answers. That wraps up last year. What will we see this year? Weâve given hints throughout this report. Letâs bring it all together. AI dominated the news for 2024. It will continue to do so in 2025, despite some disillusionment. For the most part, those who are disillusioned arenât the people making decisions about what products to build. While concern about jobs is understandable in a year thatâs seen significant layoffs, we donât believe that AI is âcoming for your job.â However, we do believe that the future will belong to those who learn how to use AI effectivelyâand that AI will have a profound impact on every profession, not just IT and not just âknowledge workers.â Using AI effectively isnât just about coming up with clever prompts so you can copy and paste an answer. If all you can do is prompt, copy, and paste, youâre about to become superfluous. You need to figure out how to work with AI to create something thatâs better than what the AI could do by itself. Training employees to use AI effectively is one of the best things a company can do to prepare for an AI-driven future. Companies that donât invest in training will inevitably fall behind. In the coming year, will companies build AI applications on top of the giant foundation models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini? Or will they build on top of smaller open models, many of which are based on Metaâs Llama? And in the latter case, will they run the models on-premises (which includes the use of hosting and colocation providers), or will they rent use of these open AI models as a service from various providers? In the coming year, watch carefully what happens with the small open models. They already deliver performance almost as good as the foundation models and will undoubtedly be the basis for many AI applications. And we suspect that most companies will run these models in the cloud. Security is the other significant growth area. Companies are waking up to the need to secure their data before their reputationsâand their bottom linesâare compromised. Waking up has been a long, slow process that has sunk the careers of many CEOs and CIOs, but itâs happening. Our users are studying to gain security certifications. We see companies investing in governance and putting in company-wide policies to maintain security. In this respect, AI cuts both ways. Itâs both a tool and a danger. Itâs a tool because security professionals need to watch over huge streams of data, looking for the anomalies that signal an attack; itâs a tool because AI can digest sources of information about new threats and vulnerabilities; itâs a tool because AI can automate routine tasks like report generation. But itâs also a danger. AI-enabled applications increase an organizationâs threat surface by introducing new vulnerabilities, like prompt injection, that weâre only now learning how to mitigate. We havenât yet seen a high-profile attack against AI that compromised an organizationâs ability to do business, but that will certainly happen eventuallyâmaybe in 2025. Whatever happens this year, AI will be at the center. Everyone will need to learn how to use AI effectively. AI will inevitably reshape all of our professions, but we donât yet know how; weâre only starting to get glimpses. Is that exciting or terrifying? Both.

Title: BlackRock is trying to avoid the hot seat as GOP takes power

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The world’s biggest money manager is trying to avoid some political headaches as the GOP prepares to take over all of Washington. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) late last week pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), following the exodus of several Wall Street banks from an affiliated group in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over the White House again. BlackRock also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0. The $11 trillion financial giant has for years been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing, with Republicans raising concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has backed away from using the politically contentious acronym. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. BlackRock, which reports its fourth quarter earnings Wednesday, will have to navigate all these political challenges as the GOP takes over the White House and Congress — a measure of control that could create new headaches for the money management giant. A report last month from the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, mentioned BlackRock along with Vanguard and State Street (STT) in arguing that it found "evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior" by the financial industry to "impose radical ESG-goals" on US companies. The report also criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it called "a climate cartel." Last Thursday, BlackRock confirmed its departure from one financial environmental alliance known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The group had a pledge of support from its NZAM members to help achieve net-zero emissions carbon emissions by 2050 by using their influence within the financial sector — such as supporting climate initiatives in corporate boardrooms through proxy voting. "Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," BlackRock told clients in a letter cited by Bloomberg. The company added in the letter that its portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." On Monday, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative said on its website that it had suspended its activities pending a review. It added in that note that "recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context." The other delicate political situation now being juggled by BlackRock is its resistance to the FDIC’s push for greater oversight. The FDIC had been asking BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement the FDIC wanted BlackRock to sign was similar to one announced with Vanguard that imposed new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. It was designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. BlackRock spent much of 2024 denying that it exerted undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. Last Friday, BlackRock's deadline to respond to information requests from the FDIC was extended to Feb. 10, punting the standoff into the start of Trump's new term as president. As a practical matter, BlackRock must either rebut any presumption it has control of more than 10% in a holding company of an FDIC-supervised bank by responding to the FDIC's most recent information requests or sign a "passivity agreement," according to one person familiar with the matter. It is not yet known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation or who will run the FDIC following the Republican takeover of the White House.

Title: Stock market today: Asian markets are mixed, echoing trading on Wall Street

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 10:45 PM Updated: January 14, 2025 at 5:43 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Most U.S. stocks rose Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation, though drops for Eli Lilly and other influential stocks kept indexes in check. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% as three out of every four stocks in the index climbed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 221 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%. Recommended Videos Stocks got a boost from a report showing inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. Speculation is growing about whether the Fed may cut rates zero times this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market. Yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.78%, where it was late Monday. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.36% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4.8% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.9%. Indexes drifted between gains and losses through the day in large part due to drops for several Big Tech stocks. Nvidia fell 1.1% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500. The only stock to drag more on the market was Eli Lilly, which fell 6.6% after saying it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter’s 45% growth in Lilly’s revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 21.7%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. All told Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 6.69 points to 5,842.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 221.16 to 42,518.28, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 43.71 to 19,044.39. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.7% to $77.50 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.3% to $79.92 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Asian shares were mixed Tuesday, echoing trading on Wall Street, where gains for oil and gas producers helped offset drops for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.0% in afternoon trading to 38,394.09 following a holiday on Monday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 8,231.00. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,497.95. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.9% to 19,234.98, while the Shanghai Composite surged 2.1% to 3,227.11. “After a holiday break, Japan’s markets are playing catch-up following last week’s market selloff,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Japan’s Finance Ministry reported that the surplus in the current account, a measure of the country's foreign exchanges in goods, services and investments, rose to 3.4 trillion yen ($21 billion) in November, up 54.5% from the same month the previous year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% after erasing an earlier fall of 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 358 points, or 0.9%, while the weakness for Big Tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 0.4%. Stocks have been under pressure the last month, and the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth losing week in the last five as traders reduce expectations for how much relief the Federal Reserve may deliver this year through lower interest rates. Such cuts would give the economy a boost, and the U.S. stock market ran to repeated records last year on the assumption that more are coming after the Fed began lowering rates in September. But inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target, and recent reports have suggested a still-solid U.S. economy doesn’t need much help. Questions are growing about whether the Fed will deliver even a single cut in 2025. High rates put downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments, and those seen as expensive can feel the stiffest punches. Nvidia fell 2% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500, though that represents just a smidgen of the index's huge gains in recent years. The chip company’s stock had nearly quintupled over the last three years amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Apple’s 1% slip and Meta Platforms’ fall of 1.2% were also among the heaviest weights on the market. Because they’re two of the largest companies on Wall Street, their moves pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other stocks. Moderna tumbled 16.8% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after giving a forecast for revenue this coming year that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The vaccine maker, which is seeing a slowdown in COVID-related sales, is accelerating a cost-cutting program. Macy’s fell 8.1% after saying it will likely report revenue for the last three months of 2024 that’s at or slightly below the low end of the forecast range it had earlier given. Edison International fell another 11.9% as wildfires continue to burn in the territory of its Southern California Edison utility. The utility has said fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment was involved in the ignition of the Hurst fire. On the winning side of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies after the price of oil climbed. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $78.82, while Brent crude climbed 1.6% to $81.01. The Biden administration said Friday it’s expanding sanctions against Russia’s energy industry. Exxon Mobil gained 2.6%, and Valero Energy jumped 4.9%. By Tuesday afternoon in Asia, benchmark U.S. crude lost 38 cents to $78.44 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 47 cents to $80.54 a barrel. Shares of U.S. Steel rallied 6.1% after the Biden administration pushed back to June the deadline it imposed for the Pittsburgh-based company to unwind its proposed acquisition by Japan’s Nippon Steel. Intra-Cellular Therapies soared 34.1% after Johnson & Johnson said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company and its treatment for bipolar I and II depression for $132 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7%. All told, the S&P 500 added 9.18 points to 5,836.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 358.67 to 42,297.12, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 73.53 to 19,088.10. In the bond market, which has been dictating much of Wall Street’s action lately, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.78% from 4.76% late Friday. It’s been climbing relentlessly over the last month, and it was below 3.65% just in September. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 157.58 Japanese yen from 157.26 yen. The euro cost $1.0252, down from $1.0274. ZenMarket helps you buy and ship goods from Japan.

Title: Here’s Why Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB) Is Among Monday’s Top Losers

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints. We can deliver MSR mission success too.” Overall RKLB ranks 6th on our list of Monday's top losers. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RKLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed after drops for Big Tech leave Wall Street mixed

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground in afternoon trading on Wall Street Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, after wobbling between gains and losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 201 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:14 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. A report showed inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery price registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. But speculation is growing about whether the Fed may not cut rates at all this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market, but yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.79% from 4.78% late Monday after a couple oscillations in the morning. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, edged down to 4.37% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.2%. Drops in several Big Tech stocks had weighed down the market through much of the day, before several of them reversed course. Apple and Microsoft both erased earlier losses and were both up 0.1% in afternoon trading. Eli Lilly fell 7.4% after it said it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter's 45% growth in Lilly's revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 22.1%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.1% to $76.49 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.2% to $80.07 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Sign in to access your portfolio

Tech drags down Nasdaq U.S. markets were mixed Monday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, but the Nasdaq Composite fell amid a broad tech sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.55%, with most sectors in negative territory. U.K. borrowing costs ticked higher Monday, raising concerns on public spending cuts or further tax rises. Potential new U.S. Steel bidCleveland Cliffs is partnering with rival Nucor in a potential bid for U.S. Steel, whose takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel was blocked by the White House earlier this month, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The offer would be in the high $30s a share. Nippon had planned to buy U.S. Steel for $55 per share in a deal valued at more than $14 billion. Slowing inflation in IndiaIndia's annual consumer inflation in December came in at 5.22%, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The reading's lower than the 5.30% forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts, and the second straight month that price growth fell. The softer inflation reading offers room to the RBI to cut rates, amid slowing growth in the country. Second blow to quantum stocksQuantum computing stocks sold off Monday after Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a Friday podcast by Joe Rogan that the technology is "quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." The comments reinforce recent commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that suggested that the computers are likely 15 to 30 years away. [PRO] Rieder would 100% buy the Nasdaq The Nasdaq Composite underperformed other major indexes on Monday as investors rotated out of tech names. BlackRock's Rick Rieder, who is the company's chief investment officer of global fixed income, told CNBC he would "one hundred percent" buy the Nasdaq dip. Rieder explains his decision and how he would deploy downside protection. Tech stocks underperformed on Monday as investors took profit on the victors of 2024 and looked for this year's winner. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.38%. Big tech names popular with investors broadly fell in Monday's session. Palantir — the top-performing stock in the S&P last year —slid 3.4%, while Nvidia lost 2%, building upon their losses from last week. Nvidia fell almost 6% during the period, while Palantir lost more than 15%. "That's a necessary part of a corrective phase in our view and we are likely further along in this correction than many investors recognize since many stocks peaked in late November, early December," said AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk, adding that Friday's jobs report "cemented" those concerns. However, the S&P 500 inched up 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index climbed 0.86% as investors rotated into nontech shares such as Amgen, Caterpillar and UnitedHealth. That's not to say those sectors will be taking the mantle of market leader anytime soon — or at all. Sectoral rotation is a common phenomenon in markets, as investors secure their returns and look for the next stocks with upside potential. And the backdrop of rising rates puts more pressure on growth-oriented tech stocks than value stocks, which typically make up the Dow. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence frenzy isn't over, judging by the latest earnings reports from TSMC and Foxconn, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Both companies saw their revenue boom on high demand for AI-related products. A long-term rotation out of tech and AI isn't likely. But one within the field cannot be dismissed. — CNBC's Samantha Subin, Hakyung Kim and Brian Evans contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Net Zero asset managers suspend operations in wake of BlackRock’s departure

Time Published: 2025-01-13T23:38:00Z

A global coalition of asset managers set up to meet net-zero goals has suspended its operations after the departure of its largest member, BlackRock Inc., in the latest retreat from concerted climate action in the finance sector. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, said on Monday it launched a review to determine whether the group “remains fit for purpose in the new global context.” That context is marked by pushback against corporate environmental, social and governance programs that has intensified with the political shift to the right, especially in the United States, along with antitrust concerns. The group, which has more than 325 signatories with a total of US$57.5-trillion of assets under management, will halt its activities while it tracks climate-related implementation and reporting among its remaining members. It also removed its commitment statement and list of signatories from its website, it said in an unsigned statement. Last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it was leaving the NZAMI because its membership created confusion about its business practices and prompted “legal inquiries” from public officials. It said the move did not change the way it managed funds, and that its portfolio managers still assess climate risks. The NZAMI said it was disappointed by the move but that it respected the decisions its signatories make. NZAMI’s suspension follows a mass exodus of U.S. banks from its sister organization, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, raising questions about its future. Last week, JP Morgan Chase & Co. quit that organization, after the exits of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. since the beginning of December. Each said its decision to leave the group did not mean it was abandoning its net-zero goals or efforts to help clients meet their emission-reduction targets. Canada’s Big Six banks remain members of the alliance, but the CEOs of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal said at a conference last week that the NZBA may not be the most effective tool to encourage climate change efforts at major financial institutions. Companies still need to manage climate risks and prepare for a lower-carbon economy, but worldwide organizations may not be the best way to accomplish that given differing situations in various jurisdictions, said Baltej Sidhu, an analyst at National Bank Financial. “A large portion of this is going to be actuated toward litigation concerns, and also the politicization of the theme of ESG in the U.S.,” Mr. Sidhu said. BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink had been at the forefront of integrating climate risks and decarbonization targets into its investing activities, but in recent years has backed off prioritizing the fight against climate change in his public messaging. In November, Texas Attorney-General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, accusing the major institutional investors of constricting the fossil fuel industry through “anticompetitive trade practices” by buying up shares and pushing green-energy goals. The fund managers have called the charges baseless. Vanguard quit NZAMI two years ago. The sector-specific alliances exist under an umbrella called Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was unveiled with fanfare at the United Nations climate summit in 2021 as excitement over the potential for the might of the finance industry being directed at climate action crescendoed. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor – and potential federal Liberal leadership hopeful – Mark Carney, and Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P. and a former mayor of New York, are co-chairs.

Title: Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-technology-industry-elon-musk-donald-trump/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T22:00:24Z

Watch CBS News By Julia Ingram Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: January 13, 2025 / 5:00 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise. "There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America," Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. "If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE." The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas. Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71. Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years. Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues. More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position. "The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes," said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. "If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor." Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages. Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills. In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract. These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said. "Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs." Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers. The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed. "Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters," said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, "There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent." Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow. But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers. When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable. Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe. Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023. The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform. How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed "Buy American and Hire American," aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a "great program." Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would "go to war on this issue" in one X post. "I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas," Trump said. "That's why we have them."

Title: Stock market today: Dow pops higher, tech weighs on Nasdaq as Treasury yields keep climbing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points.

Title: ‘Fact-Checking Is A Good Thing!’ CNN’s Jim Acosta Praises Biden For Slamming ‘Shameful’ Zuckerberg Move
URL: https://www.mediaite.com/news/fact-checking-is-a-good-thing-cnns-jim-acosta-praises-biden-for-slamming-shameful-zuckerberg-move/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T19:48:18Z
Full Content:
CNN anchor Jim Acosta and media correspondent Brian Stelter praised President Joe Biden on Monday for slamming Mark Zuckerberg’s “shameful” decision to end fact-checking on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s decision to end Meta’s fact-checking program drew a rebuke from Biden on Friday, when he told reporters “The idea that, you know, a billionaire can buy something and say, ‘By the way, we’re not gonna fact check anything,’ and you know, you have millions of people reading, going online, reading this stuff, it is– Anyway, I think it’s really shameful.” On Monday’s edition of CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta, Acosta and Stelter defended the Biden administration against Zuckerberg’s recent complaints, and agreed with Biden that the fact-checking move was “really shameful” because “We’ve got to have facts in this society”: JIM ACOSTA: Brian, this is the same man who banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram in 2021. I was at the White House the day that he was kicked off of Twitter. A lot has changed. What a difference four years makes. BRIAN STELTER: And I’m glad you brought that up. It was Zuckerberg. It was Facebook that banned Trump from the platform, just as Twitter did. And now here we are. And there’s very much a MAGA makeover of Meta happening. Look, I heard a business analyst describe Zuckerberg as a really effective shapeshifter, and I think that’s a great phrase for what is happening. Zuckerberg is shifting because he believes that’s what’s best for his shareholders. And remember, he owns 13% of Meta. He is a billionaire many times over thanks to that stock price that’s been on a tear lately. So he is trying to evolve the company to make sure it is successful in the Trump years. And that means, number one, being cozy to Trump, to the president-elect, keeping it in the good graces of the government, maybe making that pesky FTC antitrust case go away. It has a lot of business before the U.S. government. And I think that’s ultimately what this is all about. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, and he’s complaining about the Biden administration, you know, yelling at them to say, you know, get some of this Covid misinformation off their platforms. I mean, isn’t that that’s sort of what the White House should be doing, right? I mean, tell folks to get this garbage off these platforms, if you can, as best as you can– to get rid of fact checking altogether, especially during these wildfires. I mean, that sounds like something that could really, you know, backfire big-time. BRIAN STELTER: It’s just so easy for years later to sit around and say, you know, they were pressuring us. We went too far during an emergency, right? The early months of the Covid pandemic were an emergency unlike anything that we’ve lived through before. And were there some mistakes? Were there some screw ups? Were there some poor decisions? Of course. But it’s so easy to sit back and claim that now, as opposed to honestly reflect on what happened. And I think so much of this debate about free speech, you know, acts as if it’s very simple, when in fact, many of these operations are very complex. Ultimately, it’s about values. And I was so struck, Jim, by President Biden kind of shaming Meta the other day, shaming Zuckerberg and saying that it was shameful to remove the fact checkers. Biden obviously valuing fact, checking, even though he was often fact jacked during his four years in office. JIM ACOSTA: Right. I mean, Fact-checking is a good thing! It’s not a bad thing! And Brian, I mean, is that correct that they’re just not going to have fact checking altogether on these very powerful platforms? BRIAN STELTER: All of Meta’s, financing of fact checking is going away effective in March and it’ll be replaced by community notes, you know, letting users police themselves and decide what is true and false. It’s going to result in a much more chaotic and confusing information environment. And that’s ultimately the big picture about what this is about and why it matters. And that’s what Biden was getting at in his recent interview with USA Today. He said his biggest regret as president was not being able to navigate this changing information environment. We’ve heard some of his cabinet secretaries say the same thing, that they feel like they’re outmatched in this environment. Ultimately, when we’re talking about facts versus fiction, we should ask who benefits from the fictions? Who benefits from an environment where there are more lies, more propaganda, more innuendo spreading? And who suffers? You know, that’s the kind of cost benefit analysis that I think Zuckerberg is kind of trying to avoid as he curry favor with the incoming administration. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, fact checking is not always popular, but it is necessary. We’ve got to have facts in this society. Watch above via CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta. Have a tip or story idea? Email us.

Title: Why Tech Stocks Are Dropping Monday

Technology stocks struggled across the board Monday, including declines among Magnificent 7 firms and a big hit to quantum computing stocks. The S&P 500 technology sector fell about 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished 0.4% lower. The decline follows broad market struggles on Friday after labor market data for December came in hotter than expected, leading investors to scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Magnificent 7 were not spared, with Nvidia (NVDA) stock losing 2% and Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) shares declining about 1%. The only member of the group in the green was Tesla (TSLA), with shares up 2%. Nvidia's drop came even as the chipmaker announced a series of AI healthcare partnerships with Mayo Clinic, IQVIA Holdings (IQV), and Illumina (ILMN) on Monday, as the Biden administration proposed new rules on exporting AI chips. Nvidia called the new restrictions, meant to limit AI chip sales to certain countries, "misguided" in a blog post Monday. Shares of quantum computing companies continued to slide Monday after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed the lead of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with comments throwing cold water on the sector. In a Friday appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Zuckerberg said he believes quantum computing is "still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." That followed comments from Huang last week that "very useful quantum computers" are still 15 to 30 years away. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) shares plunged 32%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) lost close to 34%, IonQ (IONQ) fell 14%, and Quantum Computing (QUBT) dropped 27%. UPDATE—Jan. 13, 2025: This article has been updated to include additional information on proposed U.S. export rules and reflect more recent share price values.

Title: Eli Lilly's weight loss pill could get federal approval by early next year

Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) thinks its next experimental weight-loss pill could get approved as soon as early 2026. CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News on Monday that data on the drug, orforglipron, is expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory clearance the following year, Ricks said in an interview at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference (JPM) in San Francisco. Ricks also said that pills would be easier to manufacture en masse, and more simple for patients to consume, than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Eli Lilly’s popular Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, although a few pills have emerged; Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes. Read More: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The growing demand for GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, caused a shortage of both Zepbound and Mounjaro, Lilly’s other weight-loss drug, last year. Zepbound was only taken off the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list in October, while tirzepatide — the active ingredient in both drugs — was taken off in December. Eli Lilly is building a $9 billion manufacturing complex in Lebanon, Indiana, to produce key components for its GLP-1 drugs, including tirzepatide, alongside a $4.5 billion research center. It’s also invested several billion dollars in facilities in Ireland and Germany. “We will continue to increase supply, but taking into account the huge need there would probably continue to be supply constraints until we had an oral medicine with an injectable-like efficacy,” President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in May. “I think this is really an opportunity to reach more patients and also the ones that are currently fearful of injections,” Jonsson added. Surging demand for these drugs transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for the highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. In a boost to both companies, Zepbound and Wegovy have been approved for Medicare coverage. The newly expanded coverage could help many patients, as insurers have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Zepbound costs $1,086.37 per month without insurance. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are bleeding after Biden issued new AI rules

The stock market is in the red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunging more than 1% on Monday morning as new regulatory measures introduced by President Biden have severely impacted artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. These changes have raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related companies. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. Several AI-related stocks were also down on the Nasdaq, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Palantir (PLTR), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Other tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq were also down Monday morning, with Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) down by 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. —Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell on Monday as a continued selloff in tech stocks extended losses sparked by stronger-than-expected job reports. In the late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and 0.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a fresh high of 4.77%. Oil prices also surged 3.4%, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $79.2 per barrel, marking their highest levels since early October. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and UnitedHealth (UNH) on Thursday. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the key inflation indicators, the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), this week. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Several AI-related stocks were also down, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Palantir (PLTR), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (MRNA) plunged more than 23% after the company slashed its sales guidance for the year. Moderna now projects 2025 revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a significant downgrade from its earlier forecast of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion posted in September. Shares of Lululemon (LULU) surged 2.5% after the company raised its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected performance during the holiday season. The retailer now anticipates sales between $3.56 billion and $3.58 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion. The update is a positive development for investors, as the athletic apparel company has faced sluggish sales over the past year. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) spiked one week before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for his second term in office. Trump Media stock surged more than 21% on Monday afternoon, trading at $43.17 per share. That’s among the largest single-day jumps in the company’s share value since Trump won the presidential election. In the time since Nov. 5, shares of the company — which owns Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social — have climbed 21%. Despite stocks and cryptocurrencies rallying following Trump’s election victory, Trump Media shares, which had become something of a proxy for Trump’s election odds, had a surprisingly muted response to the election results. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Etsy upgraded, Pinterest downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Jefferies upgraded Etsy (ETSY) to Hold from Underperform with a price target of $55, up from $45. The firm cites improved second half growth and a more balanced risk-reward on the shares for the upgrade of Etsy. Needham upgraded KLA Corp. (KLAC) to Buy from Hold as it lowered its 2025 wafer fab equipment estimate from $110B to $100B and launched a 2026 estimate at $100B. Needham sees 2025 as likely the peak WFE, saying the current semiconductor upcycle "will be lukewarm," and the next downturn could hit in the second half of 2026. Morgan Stanley upgraded Elf Beauty (ELF) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $153, up from $139. The stocks' valuation looks compelling relative to Elf's "outsized" long-term growth potential after a sharp pullback in the stock in the second half of 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note. Needham upgraded Instacart (CART) to Buy from Hold with a $56 price target, and added the shares to the firm's Conviction List. The stronger than expected results in 2024 suggest fears over competition and total addressable market pull forward are overblown, likely driven by Instacart's leading customer experience in grocery, which continues to improve, the firm tells investors in a research note. Evercore ISI upgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Underperform with a $365 price target. The firm says that while it is hard to be a construction bull amid interest rates continuing to surprise to the upside, the stocks are down and investor expectations are now "greatly reduced." Top 5 Downgrades: Jefferies downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $32, down from $40. The firm downgraded Pinterest on expectations of slower Performance+ rollout and margin growth against its "more muted" advertising checks. JPMorgan downgraded Constellation Brands (STZ) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $203, down from $262, following the fiscal Q3 miss. While secular trends including premiumization and faster growth in legal-drinking age Hispanic consumers benefits the company's portfolio, this is balanced by near-term prolonged pressure on lower-income and Hispanic consumers and overhangs from lower consumption of alcohol by younger consumers, potential impacts from weight loss drugs, and tariff risk, the firm tells investors in a research note. Jefferies also downgraded Constellation Brands to Hold from Buy. TD Cowen downgraded STMicroelectronics (STM) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $32. STMicroelectronics is a leader in power semis with its manufacturing network a long-term advantage, but its near-term revenue and margins are likely to remain muted, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley downgraded LiveRamp (RAMP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $35. The firm sees limited catalysts for the company to accelerate growth and investor sentiment, and sees better risk/rewards elsewhere in its coverage. Truist downgraded Accolade (ACCD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $7.03, down from $7.50, after Transcarent announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the company for $7.03 per share in cash. Top 5 Initiations: Citi resumed coverage of Symbotic (SYM) with a Buy rating and $37 price target. The firm has continued conviction in Symbotic's ability to deliver strong earnings growth over time as the company remains a key beneficiary from investments across warehouse automation, which it believes remains an underpenetrated end market. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Axis Capital (AXS) with a Market Perform rating and $93 price target. BMO's caution on the direction of pricing and its ability to sustain growth/its improved loss ratio tempers its bullishness for the shares. BMO Capital initiated coverage of PG&E (PCG) with an Outperform rating and $21 price target. The firm sees the company shares as a core holding in the regulated utility sector, providing investors with exposure to a "rare deep value opportunity with premium visible growth." Truist initiated coverage of California Resources (CRC) with a Buy rating and $75 price target. The company has begun to see the fruits of its carbon management platform labor/assets, recently announcing California's first approved CCS project following receipt of final Class VI well permits from the EPA and an MOU with Net Power to develop Net Power's ultra-low emission power plants in California. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Newmont (NEM) with a Buy rating and $47.20 price target. As major projects progress and $3B of divestments complete, Newmont's portfolio will transition to a largely Tier 1 asset base, supporting accelerated de-leveraging and capital management, the firm tells investors in a research note.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Crowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Fundamentals Are ‘Excellent,’ Praises CEO’s ‘Apology Tour’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 74 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Palo Alto Networks. He instead recommended Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as a better buy. ” Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell precipitously, almost 10% over a week, with nothing going on whatsoever. Therefore, that was a disparity with the fundamentals, which I think are excellent. The one to buy right now, at this moment, is Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), as it’s starting to bounce back. That’s the one now playing offense after we had George Kurtz, the CEO, visit 130 companies in 100 days as part of what you’d call the apology tour for what occurred in the third week of July. I really like that one better now.” Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “A non-benchmark stake in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) (-40%) was the biggest detractor among individual stocks. The shares of this cybersecurity platform provider fell precipitously in July, after a glitch in a CrowdStrike software update led to a global outage for many of its customers that, among other impacts, caused the mass cancellation of flights around the world. After bottoming out in early August, the stock made a partial rebound by quarter end, but we exited the fund’s holding during the summer.” Overall, CRWD ranks 5th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s: Marketing’s Role In The DEI Collapse
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gillianoakenfull/2025/01/13/meta-amazon-mcdonalds-marketings-role-in-the-dei-collapse/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T13:57:03Z

FILE - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the tech giant's Connect developer conference in Menlo ... [+] Park, Calif., Sept. 27, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) When Meta announced the dismantling of its DEI initiatives last week, it marked a pivotal moment in corporate America. Following similar actions by Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart, and Ford, Meta’s decision underscored a growing trend: companies stepping away from diversity programs once seen as moral and business imperatives. The fall of DEI isn’t just a reflection of its flaws — it’s a cautionary tale for marketers about the dangers of oversimplifying complex issues. Marketing doomed corporate DEI initiatives by overpromising transformation and underdelivering results, exposing structural flaws that left these programs vulnerable to criticism and collapse. While economic pressures, legal risks and cultural debates accelerated this retreat, the deeper issue lies within DEI itself. By focusing too narrowly on representation metrics and creating expectations that were nearly impossible to meet, DEI often fell short of addressing systemic inequities. Marketing’s role in amplifying these shortcomings further accelerated DEI’s decline. By elevating lofty promises without actionable results, marketers unintentionally highlighted the limitations of DEI — leaving it open to widespread skepticism. This reckoning leaves marketers and business leaders grappling with urgent questions: What went wrong with DEI? How can companies rebuild trust with stakeholders? And what frameworks can drive meaningful, sustainable change? These questions lie at the heart of this article and the broader discussion to come. From the beginning, DEI was a concept with structural weaknesses that made it difficult to implement meaningfully. While its goals were admirable, its execution left much to be desired. For many organizations, DEI became synonymous with increasing demographic diversity. While representation is an important component of equity, it’s not the whole picture. DEI programs measured success by demographic counts but ignored systemic issues like pay inequities or biased workplace culture. A 2019 study published in the Harvard Business Review found that while 75% of companies conducted unconscious bias training as part of their DEI efforts, only 25% reported any measurable improvements in workplace equity or inclusion metrics. Similarly, a 2022 report by the Society for Human Resource Management highlighted that most DEI programs failed to close pay gaps or address structural inequities, emphasizing the need for deeper systemic change. While DEI was framed as a moral imperative, its return on investment was rarely clear. Leaders struggled to connect representation or training programs to tangible business outcomes like productivity, innovation, or employee satisfaction. Without this clarity, DEI became an easy target during times of economic belt-tightening. DEI often positioned itself as a solution to deep social problems, but its prescriptive and moralistic tone alienated some employees and customers. Instead of cultivating inclusion, DEI messaging often deepened divides, as critics viewed it as tokenistic or overly political. At its core, DEI focused too narrowly on representation without addressing universal human needs — such as belonging (feeling part of a community), security (physical and psychological safety), and empowerment (having the tools and autonomy to thrive) — that are essential for cultivating trust, connection, and engagement across stakeholders. Marketing played a crucial role in turning DEI into a public-facing initiative, but in doing so, it also exposed the framework’s shortcomings. Poorly executed campaigns often exacerbated the perception that DEI was superficial or performative, undermining its credibility. Marketers often elevated DEI as a transformative solution. But when companies failed to back these promises with meaningful action, the messaging rang hollow. Amazon promoted its commitment to workforce diversity through marketing campaigns and public updates, but reports of inequities in warehouse conditions and a lack of diversity in leadership revealed a disconnect between its messaging and reality. Many campaigns relied on surface-level symbolism—like diverse imagery or token representation—without addressing systemic issues. The Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad, which trivialized the Black Lives Matter movement, became a lightning rod for criticism because it highlighted the disconnect between corporate intentions and public perception. Similarly, Heineken faced backlash for a tone-deaf ad that seemed to imply ‘lighter is better,’ while H&M drew outrage for featuring a Black child in a hoodie labeled ‘Coolest Monkey in the Jungle. By reducing complex social issues to easily digestible slogans, marketing often made DEI feel shallow. These campaigns ignored the nuances of inclusion, creating skepticism from both employees and consumers. Starbucks’ 2015 ‘Race Together’ campaign, which encouraged baristas to start conversations about race with customers, was widely criticized as naïve and performative. In focusing on surface-level identity over substance, marketers missed the opportunity to address consumers’ functional, emotional, and social needs holistically. By 2024, the corporate retreat from DEI was in full swing, driven by a combination of external pressures and internal failures. The fallout exposed deep flaws in the framework, as well as the dangers of superficial marketing efforts tied to it. Layoffs in DEI departments became widespread as companies faced economic headwinds. At the same time, the legal risks associated with affirmative action and diversity quotas, compounded by the shifting political landscape after the contentious 2024 elections, made these initiatives less appealing to executives. Without clear business outcomes to justify DEI’s continuation, it became an easy target for budget cuts. As DEI programs faltered, employees became disillusioned. They saw little progress in areas like pay equity or career advancement, leading to disengagement. At the same time, consumers grew wary of performative gestures and empty promises. The disconnect between internal practices and external marketing left both groups feeling betrayed. A 2024 report by Edelman highlighted that 63% of employees felt their company’s public-facing DEI messaging did not reflect their internal workplace experiences, while 58% of consumers expressed distrust toward brands that failed to show tangible progress on equity initiatives. The public dismantling of DEI programs by major corporations like Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart and Ford is emblematic of the broader retreat — feeding perceptions that corporate commitments to diversity and inclusion are fragile. This backlash underscores a key takeaway for marketers and business leaders: initiatives that fail to deliver meaningful results risk alienating their audiences. To move forward, marketers must rethink their approach to addressing societal challenges and adopt frameworks that prioritize authenticity, systemic change, and universal human needs. DEI’s downfall illustrates the risk of reducing systemic issues to branding exercises. Marketers must avoid turning social challenges into shallow campaigns and instead focus on aligning messaging with meaningful internal action. Marketing efforts should reflect internal realities. Before launching campaigns, companies must align messaging with internal practices, like pay equity and workplace culture. When the internal foundation is strong, external efforts resonate more deeply with audiences. The future of corporate responsibility isn’t about hitting representation targets—it’s about addressing universal human needs like belonging, trust, and well-being. By focusing on systemic outcomes rather than identity-based metrics, marketers can create campaigns that resonate broadly and drive real impact. DEI’s demise wasn’t inevitable, but it was predictable. Structural flaws and poorly executed marketing turned a promising idea into a polarizing and ineffective framework. For marketers, this is a moment of reckoning — not just to avoid the mistakes of DEI, but to redefine how businesses tackle societal challenges. Marketing doomed corporate DEI by overpromising transformation and delivering superficial results. The way forward isn’t about abandoning the ideals behind DEI, but evolving them into frameworks that drive real impact. This shift is critical — not just for connecting with consumers, but for creating workplaces and communities where everyone can thrive. DEI may be dead, but its lessons offer marketers a blueprint for building trust and driving meaningful impact. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Sonos CEO Patrick Spence steps down after disastrous app launch
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342179/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-resignation-reason-app
Time Published: 2025-01-13T13:00:00Z

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the job today, effective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the role of interim CEO. It’s the most dramatic development yet in an eight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time in Sonos’ history. The company’s decision to prematurely release a buggy, completely overhauled new app back in May — with crucial features missing at launch — outraged customers and kicked off a monthslong domino effect that included layoffs, a sharp decline in employee morale, and a public apology tour. The Sonos Ace headphones, rumored to be the whole reason behind the hurried app, were immediately overshadowed by the controversy, and my sources tell me that sales numbers remain dismal. Sonos’ community forums and subreddit have been dominated by complaints and an overwhelmingly negative sentiment since the spring. In October, Sonos tried to get a handle on the situation, which, by then, had spiraled into a full-on PR disaster, by outlining a turnaround plan. The company vowed to strengthen product development principles, increase transparency internally, and take other steps that it said would prevent any mistake of this magnitude from ever happening again. I can also report for the first time that Sonos hired a crisis management public relations firm to help navigate the ordeal. But three months later, Sonos’ board of directors and Spence have concluded that those steps weren’t enough: the app debacle has officially cost Spence his job. No other changes are being made today, however. So for now, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, who some employees have privately told me deserves a fair share of the blame for recent missteps, will remain in his role. “We’re going to initiate a search for the next CEO, and we’ll work on finding a leader who’s going to continue to build on our legacy and work with the team to move the company forward,” Sonos spokesperson Erin Pategas told me by phone on Sunday afternoon. She described the leadership change as “turning a page on the chapter that we’re in and forging a path ahead that gets us in the direction that we want to be going for ourselves and our customers.” In case you were wondering, that direction will not include a return to the old Sonos app; Pategas said the company remains fully committed to the new software, which has received a slew of bug fixes and gradually added back previous features over the last several months. It’s gotten better, but even this far along, complaints remain about speakers randomly vanishing from the app and other problems. Spence joined Sonos in 2012 as chief commercial officer. As CEO, he oversaw a wide range of successful hardware products: Sonos released several impressive soundbars (including the still-new Arc Ultra), pushed into portable audio with the Move and Roam, and debuted the forward-looking Era 300 spatial audio speaker. But the app stumbles — and Spence’s failure to apologize in the immediate aftermath — ultimately soured his reputation with the company’s most loyal customers. There was no overcoming that. Spence will technically remain with Sonos until June 30th of this year, during which time he’ll receive a base salary of $7,500 per month for providing the company with “strategic advisory services.” And when that end date rolls around, he’ll be granted a severance of $1,875,000. Those numbers come from an 8K filing that Sonos made with the SEC regarding today’s news. In my time at The Verge, I’ve covered Sonos more comprehensively (and I’d like to think fairly) than any other company. Yes, that includes a long list of product leaks, but I’m far more interested in shining a light on all the frustrations caused by the new app — both for customers and staff — and the bad decisions that led Sonos off the tracks. Those choices have had repercussions for ordinary employees who gave their best to the brand. If you have more to share about the last year at Sonos, please reach out to me confidentially and securely over Signal at (845) 445-8455 or chriswelch.01. I can also be reached via DM on Bluesky, X, or Instagram. It now falls on Conrad, who joined the Sonos board in 2017, to rally disenchanted employees and make good on winning back consumer trust. Conrad’s career includes a 10-year tenure as chief technology officer at Pandora and two years as VP of product at Snapchat. He worked on Apple’s Finder software during the ’90s. Most recently, Conrad served as chief product officer for the ill-fated Quibi streaming service. Pategas believes he’s a great fit for the interim CEO position because he’s keenly aware of the company’s current predicament; Conrad and chief innovation officer Nick Millington have already been spearheading Sonos’ fix-the-app effort for months. Despite this seismic shift at the top, Sonos’ future product pipeline remains “full steam ahead,” Pategas told me. The company’s next major new product is rumored to be a streaming video player, which would pit it against the likes of Apple, Roku, Amazon, and Google in the living room. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Is MicroStrategy Buying More Bitcoin? Here’s How It Could Impact the Best Wallet Token Presale
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-buys-btc/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T12:08:09Z
Full Content:
More green dots have appeared on MicroStrategy’s portfolio tracker. For context, every green dot signals a Bitcoin ($BTC) purchase – of which there have been at least six since December. Michael Saylor announced the last purchase worth $101M on January 6, which brought MicroStrategy’s $BTC Yield to 74.3% in 2024. Yesterday, Saylor posted the Bitcoin BTC$91,214 tracker for the 10th consecutive week, signaling another possible Bitcoin purchase. MicroStrategy’s current $BTC holdings amount to $42.24B, and, according to Saylor’s X account, he’s ‘thinking about the next green dot.’ Despite Saylor’s continued confidence and a long-term bullish outlook, $BTC is facing some strong headwinds right now, trading at $91.3K. Some analysts say Trump’s tariff plans could be at fault, while better employment rates in the US and a stronger dollar have also put pressure on crypto trades. Saylor made a name for himself as a devoted $BTC HODLer. And his faith in $BTC certainly appears to be paying off for MicroStrategy. After all, MSTR stock price grew 468% year-to-date and 2,185% since the company started acquiring crypto. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock price is now so closely correlated with the $BTC value that we can safely call it a ‘$BTC-indexed company’ or a ‘$BTC-correlated investment vehicle.’ This means that a sudden decline in $BTC’s price could decimate MicroStrategy’s shares. Yet, this scenario is unlikely in the upcoming year, given the ongoing bull run and growing institutional adoption of crypto. Saylor recently also gave a 44-slide pitch on why Microsoft should invest $100B yearly on $BTC. We don’t know if Microsoft’s board of directors took Saylor’s advice, but his points were compelling. Saylor argues that by doing so, MSFT stock could add $5T in market cap. Against all expectations, the $BTC rally following Trump’s election victory was short-lived. Instead of hitting $150K, $BTC dipped to $90K. The sharp correction likely results from a stronger dollar, improving employment figures in the US, along with some FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). Indeed, some experts believe uncertainty over Trump’s new economic policies may have also contributed to this downturn. That’s because Frump’s tariffs could further strengthen the dollar. And whenever the dollar strengthens, investor risk appetite weakens. Also, the Fed has no reason to lower interest rates now, after it already cut them by 25 basis points in December. By all accounts, we can expect riskier assets to be on a bumpy ride in the short term, but volatility is nothing new for crypto, and seasoned investors like Saylor know to buy the dip. All of the above draws us to one conclusion – HODL ’til things look up. Whether you want to play it safe with $BTC or invest in new promising projects with potentially higher returns, Best Wallet offers an easy entry into the crypto market. This multi-chain wallet’s standout feature is the presale aggregator, which gives users early access to hot new tokens, including meme coins like $WEPE and $SOLX. Its native token $BEST is now also on presale, with over $7M raised in just a couple of months. $BEST holders will gain governance rights, lower transaction fees, and higher yields in Best Wallet’s staking aggregator. One $BEST now costs $0.023575, but the price will increase in 16 hours. This means now is the last chance to join the Best Wallet ecosystem at the lowest possible price and maximize your profits when the bull run starts up again. It’s easy to criticize MicroStrategy’s investment strategy as reckless, but the results to date speak for themselves. Even if a stronger dollar and Trump’s economic agenda put temporary pressure on the crypto market, the long-term outlook remains bullish. Still, as always, we remind you to DYOR and diversify your portfolio because risk management is critical in every investment. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Notable Business Negotiations of 2024

PON – Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School - https://www.pon.harvard.edu By Katie Shonk — on January 13th, 2025 / Business Negotiations For corporate dealmakers, 2024 was a relatively slow year. Yet several notable business negotiations and conflict resolution decisions captured headlines and offered lessons for negotiators across sectors. Let’s take a look at 10 that stood out: Discover step-by-step techniques for avoiding common business negotiation pitfalls when you download a copy of the FREE special report, Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals, from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. 10. A failed succession plan. In December, a Nevada commissioner ruled against media mogul Rupert Murdoch in his efforts to cement control of his family trust with his eldest son, Lachlan. According to the commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman Jr., Murdoch and Lachlan acted in “bad faith” in their attempt to alter the irrevocable trust, which will divide control of Murdoch’s empire among his four oldest children—Lachlan, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence—upon his death. Murdoch, 93, was motivated to elevate Lachlan to a permanent leadership role to ensure that his media holdings will maintain their conservative bent. In December, Murdoch launched a long-shot effort to overturn the ruling. 9. Salaries lag in WNBA. Interest in women’s basketball has skyrocketed in recent years, thanks to the rise of superstar Caitlin Clark and other top players. Yet many were surprised to hear that Clark’s starting salary in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is only about $76,500, a small fraction of what male players earn in the NBA. While Clark earns the bulk of her income from endorsements, many WNBA players supplement their relatively low salaries by playing on foreign teams in the offseason. As profits rise in women’s basketball, it will become more difficult for WNBA teams to continue to justify low salaries. It’s one of many fields in which women face an uphill battle in salary negotiations. 8. Taking the salty with the sweet. In August, chocolate-maker Mars announced a planned $35.9 billion acquisition of snack-maker Kellanova, whose brands include Cheez-It, Pringles, and Eggo. Privately owned Mars, which produces M&M’s and Snickers candy bars, has been expanding beyond its core business with recent acquisitions, including the maker of KIND bars and pet food brand IAMS. The diversification deal comes amid volatility in the food market, as some consumers resist recent rises in grocery prices. 7. Boeing’s troubles mount. Boeing’s ongoing business and ethical crisis was exacerbated by a seven-week strike by 33,000 of its machinists in 2024. With the union workers on the picket lines, Boeing halted production of its 737, 777, and 767 jets at an estimated cost of $5 billion. The workers went on strike after rejecting a contract that promised a 25% pay raise over four years. After threatening mass layoffs, Boeing, led by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, ultimately offered the machinists a pay hike of 38% over four years. A majority of the workers voted to ratify the new contract. At year’s end, strikes by Amazon and Starbucks workers further highlighted workers’ attempts to gain leverage through collective action. 6. Upscale retail consolidates. Two 2024 deals aimed to help pull the luxury retail market out of its downward slide amid competition from fast-fashion leaders Walmart, Amazon, and others. In July, HBC, the parent company of department store Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed to acquire Neiman Marcus, which had filed for bankruptcy protection during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Times reports. The acquisition positions the new retail group, Saks Global, as the industry leader, with a total of 74 stores and 100 outlets. And in December, the Nordstrom family and a Mexican retail group cemented a $6.25 billion deal to purchase department store Nordstrom and take it private. With sales at Nordstrom having “flatlined” in the past decade, according to the Associated Press, the new owners plan to invest in the business without the pressure to show short-term profits. 5. Google under fire. In August, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 18 U.S. states that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly with its online search engine. Then in December, to open up Google’s Android app store to increased competition, Judge James Donato ordered Google to allow app developers to offer their own app stores on Android devices in exchange for a “reasonable fee.” The landmark decision could trigger a wave of antitrust lawsuits against tech companies. 4. Mixing business and politics. The rich and the powerful exerted their influence throughout the long and tumultuous U.S. presidential election of 2024. After Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance opposite Donald Trump on June 27, Democratic politicians, business leaders, and movie stars worked behind the scenes and in front of the camera to try to convince the president to bow out of the race. While their negotiation campaign succeeded, the switch in candidates to Kamala Harris failed to deliver Democrats a victory. After Trump was reelected, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of his biggest donors, and other Silicon Valley leaders successfully jockeyed to secure high-level positions in his administration. 3. An up-and-down media deal. In July, Paramount Global agreed to merge with entertainment studio Skydance in what DealBook called “the most tumultuous media deal in years.” Paramount’s business, which includes CBS and Viacom, had been on a “roller coaster” brought on by the loss of cable customers and significant debt, according to CNBC. On-again, off-again negotiations with Skydance culminated in an $8.4 billion deal, backed by private equity firms. The merger negotiations raised the issue of when to agree to an exclusivity period. 2. AI investments. In 2024, tech companies jostled to bring artificial intelligence (AI) tools to market. Amazon invested $12 billion in generative AI start-up Anthropic over 14 months, and Apple and Nvidia were in talks to back OpenAI as part of a deal that valued the AI leader at $100 billion. U.S. regulators are looking closely at the investments, which allow tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to “form deep ties with their smaller rivals while avoiding most government scrutiny,” according to the Times. But the White House actually played matchmaker in one deal, pushing Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in G42 after the Emirati AI company agreed to try to keep Chinese intelligence agencies from infiltrating its systems. 1. A sluggish year for mergers. Merger and acquisition (M&A) deals fell 18% in 2024, even as the dollar volume of deals rose 9% to $3 trillion, the London Stock Exchange Group reports. High interest rates and inflation kept deal financing costs high, and the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) tough antitrust enforcement put a damper on dealmaking. Court rulings blocked the merger of JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines, as well as Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of rival grocery chain Albertsons. Corporate dealmakers anticipated that Trump’s pick for FTC chief, Andrew Ferguson, would take a more hands-off approach to M&A negotiations than his predecessor, Lina Khan, though Ferguson is expected to crack down on Big Tech, DealBook reports.

Title: TSMC fourth-quarter profit seen jumping 58% amid strong AI chip demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Faith Hung TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58% leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from U.S. government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of T$238.7 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers. "From the U.S. government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present," he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. "Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen," he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81% last year, compared with a 28.5% gain for the broader market.
