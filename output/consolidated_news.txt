Title: Jared Kushner eyes Apollo, KKR to join Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction fund: sources

Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Jared Kushner, has approached Marc Rowan’s Apollo Global Management and Henry Kravis’s KKR to assist with post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, The Post has learned. Sources familiar with the matter said Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law who has no formal role in the administration, was in New York City on Wednesday for exploratory discussions with the top asset managers in Manhattan’s swanky Hudson Yards development. Insiders said the 44-year-old held meetings at the offices of both financial giants on how to rebuild the war-torn nation. The talks, which are still at a very early stage and may not come to fruition, came on the same day that he took part in a call with Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The names of the VIP participants were released in a statement by Ukraine’s presidential office that evening. Reps for BlackRock, KKR, Affinity Partners, the Treasury Department, and President Zelensky did not return The Post’s requests for comment. A spokesman for Apollo declined to comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink halted his firm’s own multi-billion-dollar Ukraine Development Fund in July amid uncertainty over how President Trump would try to end the war. But he is set to revive the idea, which would also include involvement from the World Bank, that aimed to drum up some $400 billion in fresh investment. “This is not a huge money maker for whoever does it. They are not going to charge incentive fees. It’s a public service,” one person briefed on the situation added. “But you are going to ingratiate yourself with the president and Mr Kushner,” the source added. “They are going to f–k the Europeans.” Indeed, the move could raise fears amongst Ukraine’s allies in Europe that they will be cut out of any lucrative contracts to rebuild the war-torn country. The Trump administration, via the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in September pledged $75 million in equity intended to jumpstart the fund’s investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, defense, and related infrastructure in Ukraine. That investment is set to be matched by Kyiv to bring it to an initial combined total of $150 million, but DFC stressed that much of the work would be done by “aligned private sector partners.” Ukrainian government officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, are set to hold what one source described as “marathon talks” about the US-backed peace proposal this weekend. They will also focus on how to rebuild the nation that has been subjected to a brutal four-year attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map by Russian invaders. Kushner, who is not formally part of the administration, has emerged as a central figure in the process of negotiating a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Alongside Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, he attended five hours of Kremlin talks last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then later discussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Kushner, married to the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, previously played a major role in negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and has also put forward proposals for reconstruction in Gaza. A key point in plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine has been the establishment of an investment fund for sectors including rare metals – sought by the United States, with Svyrydenko playing a key role in setting it up. Kyiv sent its own revised draft of the now 20-point plan to the White House on Wednesday, according to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis? Choose your Lara If you're staying up all night to watch The Game Awards 2025, follow along with our live coverage. If you want an early night, you can catch up on all the news with our Everything Announced at The Game Awards 2025 roundup. The "future of Tomb Raider" has been dutifully revealed at this year's Geoff Awards, and it turns out the future is half-future, half-past. Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics have announced a pair of Tomb Raider games - Tomb Raider: Catalyst, the next major new instalment in Lara Croft's adventures, and the previously leaked Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, "a fully reimagined version" of Core Design's original Tomb Raider from 1996. Let’s start with Catalyst. It’s been in development at Crystal Dynamics since they partnered with Amazon Game Studios back in 2022, and is set in Northern India following “a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them”. Lara is racing various cackling badniks to claim yet another mighty treasure with the apparent power to reshape the geography underfoot. “As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future,” the press release declares. Here’s a video. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be the “largest Tomb Raider world yet”, with all the forgotten crypts and puzzles one might expect of a game featuring Indiana Jones’s sister from another mother. (Dear precious commenters, please find a way to make that rhyme - it’s 3am here and there is no poetry left in my bloodstream.) It’ll launch in 2027 for PC via Steam. Before that, though, you’ll be able to play Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which is being developed by Crystal and Shadow Warrior devs Flying Wild Hog. This also runs in Unreal Engine 5, and boasts of “new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game”. You’ll once again be hunting for the Scion, another momentous McGuffin that must be kept out of dastardly hands, and yes, the dinosaurs are still in it. Ah, my friend the T-Rex. It has been too long since you last chased me screaming around that cave. Look out for these and other hand-Crofted pseudo-vintage delights via Steam in 2026. Both the Catalyst and Legacy Of Atlantis incarnations of Croft are being voiced by Alix Wilton Regan - aka the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition, also known for roles in Mass Effect 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. It's been a very rough time for Crystal Dynamics this year, with three rounds of layoffs in swift succession. The last of those came in November, when the studio announced that "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" had been let go. Naturally, the press release for Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis paints a rosier picture, with Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos commenting that "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise." As for the remake, Wild Hog CEO Michał Szustak assures that "we’re expanding the universe while staying loyal to what fans have always loved." Time for another volcanic argument about tank controls, I guess. Games aside, Amazon are also working on a TV adaptation of Lara's adventures.

The first title, Tomb Raider: Catalyst, is Lara Croft's next big game. Slated to launch in 2027, the teaser trailer references Lara's struggles across the reboot trilogy, while showing her gearing up and fighting across more ancient ruins and lost civilizations. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the press release touts that Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the series' "largest world yet," bringing more puzzles and mysteries for the intrepid explorer to solve. You can check out the teaser trailer for Tomb Raider: Catalyst below: Before that game arrives though, players will have the opportunity to revisit one of Lara's first outings...well, kinda. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996. Also developed with Unreal Engine 5 and with support from Flying Wild Hog, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is slated to launch in 2026. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, a deal that was struck all the way back in 2022, and both games will be launching across Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC (Steam), and PlayStation 5.It's been a minute since a new Tomb Raider game launched, with Eidos Montreal launching Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018 as the conclusion to the trilogy that began in 2013. Since then, Eidos Montreal and its sister studio Crystal Dynamics have changed hands, leaving Square Enix and being sold to Embracer Group. Unfortunately, in keeping with much of the rest of the gaming industry, Crystal Dynamics has also had multiple rounds of layoffs through 2022.

A wide range of foreign and domestic investors were allotted shares, including the government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Fidelity, Norges Bank, BlackRock, Aberdeen, Wellington, Capital World, J P Morgan Investment Management Inc., Goldman Sachs and Aranda Investments Pte. Limited, according to a circular uploaded on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) website. Domestically, the anchor book also saw participation from the state-owned LIC and top mutual fund houses, such as SBI MF, Nippon India MF, Axis MF, HDFC MF and Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, among others. According to the circular, ICICI Prudential AMC has allotted 1.39 crore shares to 149 funds at ₹2,165 apiece, which is also the higher end of the price band. This anchor allocation comes on the heels of a pre-IPO (initial public offering) funding round, where 26 domestic and foreign investors infused ₹4,815 crore into ICICI Prudential AMC. As part of this transaction, the asset management company undertook a private placement of 2,22,40,841 equity shares at an issue price of ₹2,165 apiece, according to its public announcement on Wednesday. This substantial fundraise drew participation from a diverse set of investors, including Lunate Capital, the Estate of late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, IIFL Asset Management, 360 One Funds, Whiteoak Capital, HCL Capital, and market veterans Manish Chokani and Madhusudan Kela. Alongside external investors, the ICICI Bank itself invested ₹2,140 crore to acquire an additional 2 per cent stake in the asset management company. With the anchor round completed, the company is now gearing up for its ₹10,602-crore maiden public offering, which will open on December 12 and close on December 16. ICICI Prudential AMC has set a price band of ₹2,061 to ₹2,165 per share for the issue, valuing the company at about ₹1.07 lakh crore ($11.86 billion). The IPO will be an entirely offer-for-sale (OFS) of more than 4.89 crore shares by its promoter, UK-based Prudential Corporation Holdings, meaning the company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Currently, the ICICI Bank holds 51 per cent in the AMC, while Prudential owns the remaining 49 per cent. Once listed, ICICI Prudential AMC will become the latest asset manager to debut on Indian stock exchanges, joining players such as HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Shriram AMC and Nippon Life India Asset Management. It will also be the fifth ICICI Group entity to be listed, after ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard and ICICI Securities. The company is scheduled to make its stock market debut on December 19. Published on December 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart. After the recent price action, the “price has been slowly bleeding inside this structure and now potentially forming a nice rounded bottom. If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Tech stocks tumble amid renewed AI worries on Wall Street
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/corporations/tech-stocks-oracle-nvidia-rcna248682
Time Published: 2025-12-11T22:55:51Z
Full Content:
news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As tech companies push the stock market to record highs, fears of an artificial intelligence bubble continue to simmer on Wall Street, where even a slight earnings miss threatens to upend high-flying stocks. On Thursday, Oracle was the latest company to experience that firsthand. Oracle shares closed down nearly 11% on Thursday after the company announced revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. That wiped nearly $70 billion off the company's market value in a matter of hours. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only major index to close lower, because of tremors in the market made by Oracle. The S&P 500 ended the day at a record high, as did the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Oracle also announced Wednesday night that its spending for fiscal 2026 would be $15 billion more than its estimate in September. The company's total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 are set to be $50 billion. Many of those expenses will be driven by contracts with the likes of Meta and Nvidia, Oracle said. It also said it had a backlog of signed contracts with customers worth $523 billion. Long known for dull back-office software systems, Oracle this year found a renewed purpose as a provider of cloud computing services for the AI boom. But Oracle's share-price drop Thursday had a ripple effect on other top AI stocks for most of the day. Nvidia shares dropped almost 1.5%, while chipmakers Arm Holdings and Intel slid more than 3%. Google owner Alphabet dropped 2.4%. Data center operator CoreWeave and other chipmakers, like AMD and Micron, also dipped into the red. As Oracle's spending rises on the back of AI deals — which some consider "circular" — the company's credit default swaps have soared. The swaps, or CDSes, can be a proxy to gauge how risky a company's bonds or debt are. After Oracle's earnings report Wednesday, they soared to the highest level since 2009, according to Bloomberg, which cited data from the exchange operator ICE. Oracle's credit default swaps have become a closely tracked measure among investors and a barometer for the state of the AI industry overall. On Wednesday night's call, Oracle's principal financial officer, Doug Kehring, said the company is "committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating." "Investment grade" is a rating given to a company's bonds or credit on a sliding scale. Anything below investment-grade is considered speculative, also often referred to as junk. Earlier Thursday, Oracle declined as much as 16.5%, which would have put it on track for its worst one-day performance since 2001. With the S&P 500 up more than 16% and the Nasdaq Composite up more than 20% for the year, the market broadly remains in good shape. Still, the nature and the size of the AI deals — and their uncertain returns — are leading some to question whether the investment boom portends an upcoming bust. Part of those valuations comes from an increasingly complex, interconnected web of deals as AI companies invest in one another. Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI have all announced various investment deals worth tens of billions. In September, chipmaker Nvidia announced a deal to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. But Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said this month that "we still haven't completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them." The comments underscored how much distance there is between a splashy investment announcement and a binding contractual obligation. At the same time Oracle's shares decline, so do the fortunes of the company's majority shareholder, Larry Ellison. Ellison, ranked as the world's second-richest person by Bloomberg Billionaires, has a fortune worth more than $280 billion. Ellison's son, David, is making a hostile $108 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, trying to upend an agreement Warner Bros. already has to sell its movie studios and HBO to streaming giant Netflix. David Ellison is backstopping his bid with the family's fortune, which rests in large part on shares of Oracle. Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: llm-web-research added to PyPI
URL: https://pypi.org/project/llm-web-research/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T21:35:37Z
Full Content:
pip install llm-web-research Copy PIP instructions Released: Dec 11, 2025 A precision-focused LLM-powered web research tool that prioritizes accuracy over quantity A precision-focused LLM-powered web research tool that prioritizes accuracy over quantity. Unlike traditional web scraping or search tools that aim to return as much information as possible, llm-web-research is designed with a different goal: reducing false positives. This tool is built for use cases where: This package provides two functions: Use precise_web_research when accuracy is critical. It uses a 4-step verification pipeline that catches ambiguity and returns "Information unclear" rather than guessing: Use web_research for quick searches when the query is unambiguous: Both functions support multiple providers: Large Language Models have a well-documented tendency to provide answers even when the best response is "I don't know." This bias becomes particularly problematic in web research scenarios: When faced with ambiguous queries, LLMs tend to latch onto the most prominent entity rather than acknowledging uncertainty. For example: "Michael Johnson height" - The model may confidently return the height of Michael Johnson the Olympic sprinter, even though there are thousands of people named Michael Johnson. Without additional context specifying which Michael Johnson, any answer is potentially wrong. "Springfield population" - The model might return data for Springfield, Illinois (the state capital) when the user meant Springfield, Massachusetts, or any of the 30+ other Springfields in the US. "Washington County median income" - With Washington County existing in 30+ US states, the model often defaults to the most populous or most-searched one rather than flagging the ambiguity. Traditional LLM responses often sound confident regardless of actual certainty. A model might state "Michael Johnson is 6'1" tall" with the same tone it would use for "The Earth orbits the Sun" - even though the former is answering an fundamentally ambiguous question. This package attempts to correct for these biases through a novel Funnel of Verification (FoVe) prompting method combined with algorithmic post-processing. The Funnel of Verification is a multi-step pipeline that progressively narrows down and validates information: Step 1 - Broad Information Gathering (web search): Cast a wide net to understand what the entity is and gather context. Includes an early exit if no information is found ("ANSWER NOT FOUND"). Step 2 - Critical Ambiguity Check (no web search): Analyze the gathered context with explicit instructions to flag ambiguity. The model is prompted to identify: If ambiguity is detected, the pipeline exits early with "RESPONSE NOT CONFIDENT" rather than guessing. Step 3 - Skeptical Verification (web search): For queries that pass the ambiguity check, perform a verification search specifically looking for contradicting information or potential confusions. Step 4 - Structured Output (no web search): Format the final answer as strict JSON with binary confidence scoring. Internally, FoVe uses binary confidence scoring (0 or 1) to make decisions: When confidence is 0, the answer is automatically set to "Information unclear" rather than returning a potentially wrong answer. This binary approach forces the system to make a clear decision: either we're confident enough to stand behind this answer, or we're not. A key feature of FoVe is its early exit strategy. Rather than pushing through ambiguous queries and returning potentially wrong answers, the pipeline exits as soon as uncertainty is detected: This is intentional - no answer is better than a wrong answer for precision-focused use cases. Both functions return results as a pandas DataFrame, making it easy to integrate into data analysis workflows: For large batch searches, enable safety mode to save progress after each query. This prevents data loss if the API fails mid-run: If the process is interrupted, you'll have all completed results saved to the CSV file. This package is part of the cat-llm ecosystem.

Title: Rocket Lab’s $554M Revenue Dwarfs AST SpaceMobile’s $18M Despite Identical $30B Valuations

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Shares of AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) and Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) are drawing intense retail attention in December, with both space stocks registering neutral sentiment scores of 53 as of this morning. That marks a significant cooldown from early December, when AST SpaceMobile held sentiment scores consistently above 88 through December 7-8, while Rocket Lab hovered in the 78-82 range. The convergence tells a story of shifting retail conviction as both stocks navigate similar market caps near $30 billion but wildly different operational realities. AST SpaceMobile dominated social sentiment through early December, averaging 82.5 across the seven-day period compared to Rocket Lab’s 70.5. The enthusiasm centered on the company’s satellite constellation plans, with retail traders on r/stocks and r/investing repeatedly naming ASTS among their top growth picks for 2026. One commenter on the r/stocks thread noted: “ASTS is one of the most exciting growth opportunities heading into 2026.” But the fundamentals paint a different picture. AST SpaceMobile missed Q3 estimates by 114%, reporting a loss of $0.45 per share against expectations of $0.21. Revenue of $14.74M fell short of the $20.33M estimate, and the company trades at 1,567x price-to-sales. The stock carries a 2.76 beta. Despite $1.2B in cash and over $1B in contracted revenue commitments, the path to profitability remains distant as the company targets 45-60 satellites by end of 2026. Rocket Lab presents a stark operational contrast. The company beat Q3 estimates by 71%, posting a loss of just $0.03 per share against expectations of $0.1045, while revenue of $155.08M topped estimates and grew 48% year-over-year. With 17 Electron launch contracts secured (a record) and gross margins hitting 37%, Rocket Lab demonstrates consistent execution. The company’s price-to-sales ratio of 55x, while elevated, sits far below AST SpaceMobile’s extreme valuation. Reddit discussions reflect this operational maturity. On r/wallstreetbets, one trader laid out the bull case: “Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years […] it gives you rocket fuel for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years.” The upcoming Neutron launch, expected in Q1 2026, represents a potential inflection point that could unlock Department of Defense contracts worth hundreds of millions. Both stocks trade with similar market caps and high volatility, but Rocket Lab generates 30x more revenue ($554.5M vs $18.5M) while maintaining better profitability metrics. Institutional investors recognize this, with 58% ownership in RKLB compared to 39% for ASTS. As sentiment converges at neutral levels, the divergence in fundamentals becomes impossible to ignore.

Title: Pandemic Horde is Shutting Down, Key Corps to Fold into The Initiative
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/12/11/pandemic-horde-is-shutting-down-key-corps-to-fold-into-the-initiative/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T21:15:51Z
Full Content:
The word out this morning is Pandemic Horde is giving up on whatever plans they may have had and are shutting down, with the remaining central corporations in the alliance, Blessed Beans, Horde Vanguard, Horde Armada, and Coolbeans, joining The Initiative. The announcement on Discord, as posted on Reddit. The closure announcement For those unable to read the tiny text, this is a transcription of the announcement: Johnny Trousersnake – 20:05 @everyone Update Hello friends. Last month we announced a plan to leave coalitions behind and work towards being an independent entity. They say plans never survive contact with the enemy, and as you know, ours didn’t survive the ping. There has been a lot of uncertainty since then – and people want a long-term home, and more space to live and play in. An extended stay in purgatory while attempting a rebuild and navigating today’s political landscape is something we no longer feel is feasible, nor would it be in our players’ best interests. With that in mind, we will be shuttering Pandemic Horde and closing the Alliance. We have been in contact with your CEOs over the past week to discuss this. Several Corporations, including the core of Bless, Armada, Cool Beans and VG will be joining INIT, with others following their own paths. I want to re-assure everyone that regardless of destination, standings and docking access will be maintained for all Corporations during this transition. This will not be a repeat of last month. We’d also like to address asset safety costs which has been a constant pain point for everyone. In just a moment, we’re going to assign every member of every ESI corp that stuck with us over the past month, enough Gobloons to withdraw the most expensive ship from each Dronelands doctrine from asset safety. We hope this helps out. Asset Safety Gobloons were assigned to your ‘main’ on Square. If you do not see them, please double check all of your characters. If you think you may have been missed, please contact one of these names on Discord and specify your character name: [names omitted] Gobloons are the SRP currency used by Pandemic Horde. Participation in operations earns them and you can cash them in for ISK for ship loss reimbursement. Or that is my understanding of the mechanism. So they will be issuing Gabloons to members to convert to ISK to help them get their most expensive hull out of asset safety. Given that asset safety jumped from around 2.5 trillion ISK every month to 19.5 trillion ISK in November, according to the November MER, those Gabloons are probably not going to stretch very far. Back on October 11th of this year Pandemic Horde had 48K capsuleers in its ranks and held 414 systems, making in the second largest alliance in null sec. Top 10 Sov Holding Alliances by Member Count – Oct 11 Then came the collapse, the botched evacuation from the Drone regions, the betrayal of long time allies, and the lack of any real plan for the future, during which two thirds of its members left or were kicked from the alliance. Pandemic Horde Collapse charts – Dec 11, 2025 Even then, sitting with around 16K members, it could have been a power in null sec. But that requires competent and motivated leadership, something the alliance has lacked for some time now. 16K well led pilots can carve out space to live in null sec. 16K capsuleers without leadership are just an aimless mob that will accomplish nothing. So it goes. The Initiative had previously accepted some corporations from Pandemic Horde during the collapse, and offered some temporary space Cloud Ring to what remained of the alliance in order to figure out what to do next. That wasn’t supposed to be a permanent situation, but with a leaderless alliance sleeping on your couch with no hope of survival on its own at this point, I suppose the answer was to either drive them out with a stick or take in the refugees on a more permanent basis. It isn’t often you see an alliance collapse. With even a semblance of a core and some leadership, alliances in much worse positions have come back. TEST has been driven out of its space a few times now and is still lurking… safely under the protective wing of Fraternity to be sure, but they are still around. This move will bulk up The Initiative by nearly 4K more pilots. The remaining 12K pilots left in the alliance… which includes the spy ridden Pandemic Horde Inc and its 8K members, half of what remained of the alliance… will need to figure out their own path. Long time members might be accepted into the four corporations that are merging into The Initiative. And The Initiative may take some additional corps. They already have 24, what difference would a few more make at this point? I listened to some of the town hall they had for the announcement. The message itself was pretty terse, limited pretty much to what was in the written announcement. Most of the 45 minutes was Q&A about what to do next. I am sure it was pretty dejecting for line members, one more indignity on top of almost two months of such failings. I have been covering my own interaction with events in a series of posts if you want some more back story. What happens next remains to be seen. The closure plan is set to be completed almost immediately according to the town hall. At least the whole thing will be commemorated in an special item that you can find as part of the Winter Nexus event. Gone but never forgotten now… Meanwhile, while The Initiative has always been a strong group, part of their strength has been their agility. They are now in the same weight class as their current opponent, Fraternity. Whether the additional pilots help them in their campaign or if their integration into the organization becomes a burden remains to be seen. Related: Huh.. I guess we won.

Title: Trajan Wealth: Balancing Growth with Safer Options

Time Published: 2025-12-11T20:35:39Z
Full Content:
Co-CIO David Busch discusses how the firm approaches risk/reward calculations. December 11, 2025 Trajan Wealth, a $2.5 billion RIA headquartered in Scottsdale, Ariz., has a broad mandate. The firm serves clients on almost every level of the wealth ladder—from the mass affluent, which it defines as anyone with $500,000 to $1 million in assets, including in their 401(k)s, to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth investors. In addition, the firm aims to be a one-stop shop for all of those clients’ needs, including not just wealth management, but retirement planning, estate planning, tax planning and insurance and annuity services, according to David Busch, Trajan Wealth co-Chief Investment Officer. Not surprisingly, that requires a careful balancing act, combining an acceptable level of risk—for example, through allocations to private equity and private credit—with some skepticism about popular products du jour. For example, the firm has stayed away from Bitcoin ETFs, considering crypto a highly speculative asset, though it may eventually consider Bitcoin buffer ETFs, Busch said. WealthManagement.com had a conversation with Busch, who worked as an institutional portfolio manager prior to joining the firm two years ago, about Trajan Wealth’s investment strategy and how it juggles its various clients’ needs. This Q&A has been edited for style, length and clarity. Related:Fidelis Capital: Focusing on Returns Net of Fees, Taxes and Inflation WealthManagement.com: Can you give us a sense of your typical client? David Busch: Our clientele is segmented between three groups. One I would call the mass affluent. Think about the everyday investor that retires and has $500,000 to $1 million in their 401(k) or people that have that [amount] in investable assets. We also cater to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth. And as a firm, we offer services above and beyond just wealth management. We have our wealth management team that includes investment management. We also have estate planning, tax planning and preparation, as well as insurance and annuities. The idea is to have everything under one roof, so that our clients can have access to all of those different services if they need them. WM: Can you break down your allocations for us? DB: We offer a wide variety of investment products. Everything from your typical asset allocation models that range from conservative to aggressive to managed equity models, where clients buy individual stocks based on models that one of my investment managers manages. They include everything from large cap growth to dividend growth and value. We have an alternatives sleeve, where I include our managed futures product, which is a product that’s designed to provide crisis alpha. It’s a trend-following product, and its ... within managed futures that follow 30 to 50 markets. Essentially, they attempt to make money whether the market is going up or down. The caveat is that there has to be a clear trend. Related:Citi Global Wealth at Work: Investment Guidance for Execs and Other Professionals On the private side, we have curated specific opportunities for our clients to invest as limited partners into specific private equity funds. The reason we do it that way versus using a fund-of-funds type strategy, is that we can work specifically with a private equity firm, and we can perform our due diligence. We look under the hood, we look at all the investments, and then our clients who are accredited or qualified can invest within those vehicles. In that space, we offer everything from a venture fund to real estate, infrastructure and private credit. This gives our clients opportunities to invest in some of these sectors based on their risk tolerance and time horizons. The last thing is that we have fixed-income strategies that range from ultra-short to intermediate. WM: How often do you update your allocations? DB: It really depends on the specific client’s risk tolerance and their specific needs. We review our client holdings on a quarterly basis, their financial situation, their upcoming cash flow needs, whether they have to pay for something like college education or fund a payment on a home, as well as their long-term investment goals. Related:The Hidden Flaw in Style Index Funds WM: What were some changes you’ve made to allocations recently? DB: In this moment, what we are looking at is large cap growth, specifically large cap tech, which has outperformed value for the past 15 years. That was really driven by low interest rates, and now there are some concerns in terms of valuations for some of these high-tech companies. I still am a firm believer that tech is the way of the future, and we should be invested in large cap tech over the long term. Over the near term, we have to be cognizant of the valuations, but also the capital expenditures that are required to build out the AI infrastructure. I believe there could be some short-term volatility, specifically in the big names. That’s why, right now, we are looking at providing more of a balanced approach for equity models. You have your large cap growth, but balance that with large cap value, specifically dividend payers, because that cash flow will help offset some of the volatility. And when we have market volatility, value will typically outperform growth when the market is going down. On the fixed income side, I am looking at the Fed and the cutting cycle. The front end of the curve is going to move down because the Fed controls the overnight interest rates. They’ve also announced a cessation of quantitative tightening. They are now reinvesting proceeds back into U.S. Treasuries. What that will likely look like is that it will help dampen some rate volatility, but the front end is going to be driven by the changes in the Fed’s overnight funds rate. The long end is going to be driven by supply dynamics. So, I think there could be some volatility, particularly on the long end of the curve. As a result, we are focused on the three -to five-year part of the curve. With everything that’s going on within the credit markets—the consumers are stretched very thin right now, we are seeing rising delinquencies and defaults on consumer loans—how I translate that is: “Invest on the fixed-income side in the three- to five-year part of the curve, but go up quality.” That should include Treasuries, investment-grade corporates. For high yield, I would be very cautious and selective and ensure that the names we are buying have the ability to repay that debt. You have to do a complete credit deep dive, almost like an underwriting. WM: Do you work with outside asset managers on public equities and fixed-income investments? DB: We do it all internally. We have a pretty robust team on the investment management side. We have a bank of analysts, traders, as well as portfolio managers that are constantly researching the markets and positioning based on that research. So everything we do on the public side is in-house. We currently have six people on that team. WM: How do you choose asset managers on the private market side? DB: We perform due diligence on those asset managers. The reason we steer clear of fund-of-funds type strategies is because those structures are embedded with fees—there is the private equity manager’s fee, the mutual fund company fees, and then typically, an advisor fee on top of that. So, we are removing a layer or two of those fees. When we look at each one of these private equity firms, we are using the relationships that we’ve developed over the course of our careers and doing the due diligence in terms of their background, their history, their wins, their losses and also the opportunity that is in front of us. We look at these—I would call them boutique—private equity firms. We generally steer clear of the big private equity funds that are out there. We are intentionally specific in that middle-market space. The reason is that when you are competing against the BlackRocks, the Blackstones and the Apollos of the world, and they raise billions of dollars for a new fund, they have to put that money to work pretty quickly. As a result, there is a food fight for the biggest deals that are out there. When there is a lot more competition, it waters down the returns. For us, because we are looking in that upper middle market space, we are avoiding that competition from the big players, and it has historically provided our clients with the opportunity for better returns. WM: What types of returns do you look for in that space? DB: If it’s a private equity fund, either a venture or a buyout fund, it has to beat the returns of the S&P 500, or at least we have to anticipate that it’s going to beat the returns of the S&P 500. Because what’s the point of going into a private equity fund if it can’t beat the index itself? If it’s a real estate structure, we look at the income our clients can receive, as well as the project itself and the valuations at which we are buying. In some instances, our clients are able to get accelerated depreciation for their tax returns. On the private credit side, that’s one area I am very cautious. The biggest reason is that companies have turned to private credit to access the loans they need without going to a bank. Banks have a very defined box they can lend within, based on regulations. So the promise of a private credit fund is that they can work with a company to structure the debt in a way that makes sense for the company, and it’s also speed-to-closing. What I am concerned with, is that with non-bank lenders, they are able to make loans that are covenant-lite. And what we have seen recently in headlines is that there have been some banks that participated in these private credit loans and took losses because the borrower had assigned the same collateral to multiple loans. When they failed, it’s now impacting everybody who was lending against that one specific collateral. The nice thing about bank loans is that when a bank issues a loan, they have a lien on that collateral. And in private credit, that’s not happening, and with covenant-lite, there may be instances where the lender did not follow through with all the covenants that are required to keep their position safe in the event of a bankruptcy. The other issue with that space is that we just don’t have optics into it. There is no way to really know the performance of the underlying loans. WM: Do you invest in cryptocurrency in any way? DB: We have not. Our stance has been that it’s a speculative asset class. I recognize that there are many ETFs that are available, from BlackRock and Vanguard and State Street and multiple other companies. We’ve seen the volatility in Bitcoin over the past several weeks. That’s not an asset class we necessarily want to have available to our clients. What I can see in our future is that there are some very interesting structures in the ETF space where the ETF is built to participate in the upside in the cryptocurrency growth, but while protecting the downside using derivative contracts. In that instance, there may be an opportunity for us to allocate a portion, but it’s not something we go all in on. WM: Do you invest in international markets? DB: We do. We generally invest in developed markets. We steer clear of emerging markets. In international, we’ll use ETFs. There are a few countries that we are overweight on. Essentially, India as a country has the demographics. That’s going to be the next stop for the onshoring of American manufacturing that will shift from China. They are highly educated, they are a fast-growing country. That’s more of a growth bet. But we balance that with some good old, standby, safe countries like Switzerland as an example. The currency there is strong, that market is very stalwart. WM: Do you hold cash? DB: Yes. All of our model portfolios have a portion that’s allocated to cash. It’s really for operational purposes. We try to keep that cash balance at a minimum, unless somebody has a very specific need.

The latest survey from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School shows that Americans aged 18 to 29 are deeply concerned about their future and skeptical that their leaders can solve the country’s growing problems, according to The Washington Post. This pessimism for the future also comes as the American youth are becoming increasingly radicalized, contributing to an uptick in left-wing political violence. Generation Z’s concerns are rooted in the difficult economic reality facing the US, according to the newspaper, which published the study’s data and conclusions on December 7. More than 40% of those surveyed reported financially “struggling” or “just getting by.” The high cost of housing, food prices, and a sluggish job market, marked by mass layoffs in various industries, are central themes in their daily conversations and lives. In this context, only a minority of the young people surveyed said the country is headed in the right direction, which, according to the poll, reflects the sense of instability felt by Generation Z in the US. The main message from this data is that the institutions and systems that should support them are not responding to their needs, generating widespread fear about what the future holds, the report adds. A key factor driving these economic fears is the pessimistic perception of Artificial Intelligence. The majority of young Americans see AI as a direct threat to their job prospects. A significant number even believe this technology will reduce their future employment opportunities. A Wall Street Journal report in October found that the US job market is becoming less welcoming due to a wave of layoffs primarily driven by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies like Amazon, which plans to eliminate up to 10% of its corporate workforce, United Parcel Service (UPS), which has cut nearly 14,000 managerial positions, and Target, which laid off 1,800 employees, mainly due to increasing adoption of AI, are sending experienced and young workers into a stagnant labor market. In addition to technology, investors are pressuring executive management to operate more efficiently and with fewer staff, which, along with trade uncertainty caused by tariff policy and higher costs, is contributing to the slowdown in hiring. The result is a precarious outlook for youth and regular workers, with fewer opportunities for well-paying jobs that support families and fund retirements. The Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School’s survey also underscores a marked distrust of institutions of power. Generation Z distrusts the federal government and Congress, as well as the two major political parties. When asked to summarize the parties in one word, the most common term used to describe Democrats was “weak,” while for Republicans it was “corrupt.” This negative view is indicative of a deep disenchantment with the ruling class. Approval ratings for the current Republican administration and lawmakers from both parties remained below 30%. A majority also disapproved of the Trump administration’s handling of the economy and the US healthcare system, which is characterized by its high fees. In a Fox News poll, the majority of voters said Trump’s economy had hurt them, and three-quarters of Americans said their grocery costs had gone up in the past year, according to polling from Marquette University Law School. Just 26% said Trump was doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Amid the economic problems, favorable views of Trump’s job performance have dropped by 14 percentage points, according to The New York Times’ polling average. Responding to the New York Times’ polling, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the administration was working to “deliver economic relief for the American people, from signing historic drug pricing deals to securing working-class tax cuts.” “More work remains,” he added, “but Americans can rest assured that the same policies that created a historic economy in President Trump’s first term are set to repeat the success in his second term.” Disillusionment extends to the economic system as well. According to the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School survey, support for capitalism has declined, reversing a rebound seen in 2020, and although most said they reject political violence, which has dominated the country’s news since the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, almost 40% of those surveyed consider it “acceptable under certain circumstances,” reflecting a growing radicalization among citizens in the face of political polarization. Although left-wing political violence and incidents averaged 0.6 annually from 1994 to 2000 and doubled to 1.3 over the following decade, numbers began to grow substantially in 2016, at the height of the culture wars and when Trump was first elected. From 2016 to 2024, they averaged 4.0 a year, while this year is set to break records, demonstrating how increasingly radicalized American youth are amid serious economic problems and distrust in politicians. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: JPMorgan Pushes Deeper Into Tokenization With Galaxy's Debt Issuance on Solana

Global bank J.P. Morgan has arranged a landmark commercial paper issuance on the Solana blockchain, in a move that pushes real-world financial instruments deeper into public blockchain infrastructure. Commercial paper, typically issued through legacy systems, is a short-term debt tool that companies use to raise working capital. This one was structured onchain and settled using USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle (CRCL). J.P. Morgan created the onchain token representing the debt and handled the settlement. Galaxy’s investment banking arm structured the issuance. Coinbase acted both as investor and wallet provider, while Franklin Templeton, which has already created a tokenized money market fund, also invested in the token. The move underscores the rising institutional interest to use blockchain plumbing for traditional financial instruments, also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) like debt, fund or equity. The process promises efficiency gains, faster settlement, proponents say. The tokenized asset market could mushroom to $18.9 trillion by 2033, BCG and Ripple projected. The trend has also gained support from U.S. regulators. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has recently touted tokenization as a key innovation for capital markets, saying in a FOX Business interview last week that it has the potential to change the financial system over the next couple years. The issuance was the latest example of J.P. Morgan's push into blockchain and tokenized assets. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens.

Title: Oracle shares fall 14% on increase in data centre spending
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/12/11/oracle-shares-fall-14-on-increase-in-data-centre-spending/

Oracle stock slumped after it reported disappointing revenues on Wednesday alongside a $15 billion (€12.8 billion) increase in its planned spending on data centres this year to serve artificial intelligence groups. Shares in Larry Ellison’s database company fell 14 per cent on Thursday. The move came as Oracle reported revenues of $16.1 billion in the last quarter, up 14 per cent from the previous year but below analysts’ estimates. Oracle raised its forecast for capital expenditure this financial year by more than 40 per cent to $50 billion. The outlay, largely directed to building data centres, climbed to $12 billion in the quarter, above expectations of $8.4 billion. Its long-term debt including operating leases increased to $116.3 billion, up 44 per cent from a year ago. Oracle has launched an aggressive drive to catch up with much larger cloud players such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in the race to supply the vast amount of computing power that AI groups including OpenAI and Anthropic need to train and run their models. [ Oracle’s share price surge suggests the AI trade still has momentumOpens in new window ] Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said its cloud contracts would “quickly add revenue and margin to our infrastructure business” as he defended the vast investments. Yet the company said it expected full-year revenues to remain unchanged from its previous forecast of $67 billion. It expected to generate $4 billion more in revenue the following fiscal year. Total bookings for future revenue, known as remaining performance obligations, rose 15 per cent to $523 billion in the three months to the end of November, supported by deals with Meta and Nvidia. Investors initially welcomed the push into AI from Oracle. Shares surged after its last earnings in September when it disclosed it had added more than $300 billion in bookings, largely driven by data centre contracts with OpenAI. But the stock has given up its gains since then as investors worry about the large amounts Oracle will have to borrow and spend on infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker — and concerns over the start-up’s ability to pay for these contracts in the years ahead. Debt investors have also soured on the company. Oracle’s Big Tech rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have helped reassure investors about their large capital investments by posting strong earnings from their vast cloud units. But in the last quarter, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which includes its data centres, posted worse than expected revenues of $4.1 billion. Ellison’s company is also relying more heavily on debt to fuel its expansion. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The White House has released a new National Security Strategy whose central purpose is unambiguous: to ensure the United States remains the preeminent global power. At its core is a new and pragmatic China strategy. The document opens with a blunt indictment of the past three decades of American policy, especially on China. Successive administrations—Republican and Democratic alike—embraced the delusion that flooding China with capital, technology, and market access would liberalize the Chinese Communist Party and peacefully integrate it into an America-led rules-based world order. Instead, we financed and armed our most dangerous rival. The result is a near-peer competitor that now menaces American security, prosperity, and the free world itself. The new National Security Strategy discards that fantasy. It is grounded in a cold-eyed recognition that the United States must compete—relentlessly and across various regions—while buying the time required to rebuild the industrial, technological, and military foundations that previous generations allowed to atrophy. In the Western Hemisphere, the administration is reasserting the Monroe Doctrine. China’s creeping penetration of Latin America—$2.5 billion into Panama alone, second-place usage of the canal we built, Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s pledge to wire 33 regional nations into Beijing’s orbit—has been met with swift counteraction by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, the Trump administration successfully urged Panama to withdraw from a China-funded infrastructure initiative. Soon after, Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison announced the sale of its controlling stake in two Panama ports to a group of investors led by American investment firm BlackRock. In April, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth reiterated the commitment to counter “malign Chinese influence” in the Western Hemisphere. The new security strategy declares, without apology, that the United States will remain the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere and that non-hemispheric actors—China foremost among them—will be denied military footholds and strategic resources in America’s backyard. The document delves more deeply into America’s China policy in its section on Asia. The Trump administration recognizes that the Indo-Pacific region accounts for nearly half the world’s gross domestic product by purchasing-power parity. Free and open Indo-Pacific is vital to our national interest. On the economic front, the administration seeks to a balanced trade relationship with China based on “reciprocity and fairness” to regain American economic independence. The goal is clear: “If America remains on a growth path—and can sustain that while maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing—we should be headed from our present $30 trillion economy in 2025 to $40 trillion in the 2030s, putting our country in an enviable position to maintain our status as the world’s leading economy.” Some China hawks recoil at any language of “mutually advantageous” relations, hearing in it the echo of past naïveté. They are not wrong to be skeptical. Beijing’s definition of “win-win” has always meant China wins twice. Yet, total decoupling immediately is not feasible. The United States requires time to rebuild its manufacturing capabilities and secure its supply chains. However, a measured tone does not suggest that the administration will shy away from robust competition with China or neglect the essential interests of the United States and its allies. For instance, the National Security Strategy clearly commits to cooperating with allies and strengthening military capacity that can counter aggression in the First Island Chain near China, especially to protect Taiwan due to its strategic location in the South China Sea. This area is critically important for the U.S. and its allies, with one-third of global shipping passing through it annually. The Trump administration vows to establish “strong deterrence necessary to keep these shipping lanes open and free from arbitrary closures by any single nation.” Critics of President Donald Trump have sought to paint him as someone willing to compromise Taiwan’s security for trade concessions with China. However, the security strategy directly counters these speculations, offering much-needed reassurance to both Taiwan and Japan. This clarification is particularly welcome given the increasing pressure from China on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has stated that Japan would mobilize its defense forces in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Xi, who regards the reunification as a “core interest,” is bound to feel disappointed by the strategy’s approach, as it clearly indicates that the Trump administration firmly rejects any unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Moreover, the U.S. actively encourages allies like Japan to enhance their defense expenditures and collaborate with the U.S. to maintain the South China Sea as a free and open area. The Trump administration has clearly learned from past policy mistakes. The National Security Strategy rejects the platitudes of the past, accepting the hard truth that great-power competition has returned—and that the United States intends to win it by bolstering its economic, technological, and military leadership, while resolutely defending its interests, security, and prosperity against China’s aggressive actions, particularly the Western Hemisphere and the Indo-Pacific.

Title: Weekly unemployment benefit applications rise to 236,000 as labor market concerns persist

Your monthly donation keeps PBS News strong Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here’s what experts say they mean The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. WATCH: 3 things to know about AI and mass corporate layoffs The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750.

Title: BlackRock still ‘pro-risk’ despite talk of AI bubble – Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. BlackRock remains bullish on artificial intelligence. Image / Getty Images US investment behemoth BlackRock is still “pro-risk”, despite widespread fears of a market bubble driven by the investment appetite for artificial intelligence. The fund manager sees the artificial intelligence (AI) theme as still being the main driver of US equities. “Identifying the winners as AI revenues spread is an active investment story,” BlackRock said in a commentary. “Mega-forces are transforming the global economy and markets, especially AI. “Technology is becoming capital-intensive and the AI build-out could be unprecedented in both speed and scale.” These investment ambitions were “pushing limits” on a number of fronts. “With a few mega-forces driving markets, it is hard to avoid making a big call on their direction. “We stay pro-risk and overweight US stocks on the AI theme.” BlackRock said North Asia anchored the hardware and infrastructure required for AI’s next phase. China is scaling its own AI ecosystem, and south and Southeast Asia are driving the region’s consumption and labour force growth. Unlocking these investment opportunities called for an active investment approach, BlackRock said. “We are overweight [on] Japanese equities, favour selective AI-linked opportunities in Taiwan, South Korea and China, and hold a strategic overweight to India. “The AI build-out remains centred in the US, where capital spending is scaling rapidly. Yet the spillover is evident in Asia. “Taiwan and South Korea anchor the semiconductor and memory chains powering the build-out, supported by firm order books, expanding capacity and clear earnings visibility.” South Korea equities gained more than 60% in the year to November 28, 2025, even after intermittent pullbacks as investors reassessed the pace of AI demand. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with about US$13.52 trillion ($17t) in assets under management. Forsyth Barr has reinstated Vital Healthcare (VHP) – which specialises in investing in property used in the healthcare sector – to outperform. The broker set a $2.23 target price after the company’s move to internalise management, which it sees as being a long-term positive. “The current environment of modest inflation and stable interest rates is supportive of earnings growth, and we forecast AFFO [adjusted funds from operations] to lift 5% by financial year 2028.” Forsyth Barr said concerns over private hospital profitability in Australia were abating as margins improve. “Gearing remains higher versus peers, but management internalisation unlocks strategic optionality,” Forsyth Barr said. The former manager, Canada’s NorthWest, has a 24% stake in Vital. Forsyth Barr said it expects the stake will be a likely overhang for the stock, with the first escrow rolling off in February 2026. Last month, Vital raised $220 million to fund the internalisation. At the time, VHP chair Graham Stuart said internalisation marked an important milestone. Northwest has also agreed to an escrow arrangement through to the release of Vital’s first-half 2026 result in February and to not sell down below a 10% stake until after the release of Vital’s financial-year 2026 result next August. Investment research firm Morningstar noted fixed-lines infrastructure company Chorus’ BBB long-term credit rating had been reaffirmed by S&P Global last month. However, the agency said its outlook for Chorus was upgraded to “positive”, from “stable”, citing the resilience of the group’s regulated cashflow, prudent capital management and robust balance sheet. Morningstar said Chorus’ net debt/ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] ratio of 4.5 is not quite “prudent,” especially since the covenant limit is 5.5 times. “But we concur it can be supported by the group’s ‘infrastructure-esque’ business, with legacy copper largely in the rearview and fixed-line fibre the dominant broadband facilitator.” Fibre now represents 93% of total connections (from 56% five years ago) and fibre revenue 80% (from 49%). Fibre’s share of group ebitda is likely over 90% and the resilience of these earnings is underpinned by Kiwis’ essential (and voracious) demand for fixed-line broadband, Morningstar said. “We expect such steady earnings growth to continue, as Chorus becomes ‘all-fibre’ and extracts efficiencies from being so,” it said. Morningstar lifted its fair “value estimate” for Chorus by 16% to $9.30. “We also upgrade our uncertainty rating to ‘low’ from ‘medium’,” it said. “Predictability of Chorus’ earnings is reinforced by regulatory certainty. “While it ensures no excess returns from Chorus’ near-monopoly fibre assets, the relatively benign regulatory regime is also set in stone until the end of 2028.” Forsyth Barr noted clothing retailer Hallenstein Glassons (HLG) provided a strong 18-week 2026 trading update with sales up 13.8% on the prior year, accelerating from 12.9% in the seven-week trading update in September 2025. Sales growth has been driven by continued strength in Australia, with contributions from new store openings, store expansions and refurbishments completed in the last year. While the New Zealand operating backdrop remains challenging, both businesses are trading ahead of last year. With the key Christmas and summer trading periods ahead, management cautioned against extrapolating current momentum for the year ahead. “We forecast 11% sales growth in FY26 led by continued strength in Glassons Australia,” Forsyth Barr said. The broker continued to view the “risk-reward” from Hallensteins as attractive and rated the stock as “outperform”. As expected, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to a three-year low after a divisive meeting that exposed deep fractures in the central bank over whether to prioritise weakening employment or elevated inflation, the Financial Times reported. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point to between 3.5-3.75%, as widely anticipated by Wall Street. Three of the dozen voters on the Fed’s policy-setting board objected to the central bank’s quarter-point cut, “the most powerful revolt since 2019″, the Financial Times said. Fed governor Stephen Miran, a Trump ally, wanted a half-point cut, while the Chicago Fed’s Austan Goolsbee and the Kansas City Fed’s Jeffrey Schmid called for no change.

European shares advanced, shrugging off a decline in tech stocks as broader confidence in global growth sparked a rotation into sectors linked to the economic cycle, such as construction materials and banks. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates again on Wednesday also helped calm market jitters around the health of the US economy. Outperforming its European peers, the Iseq index advanced by 1.4 per cent, led higher financial and airline stocks. AIB and Bank of Ireland advanced again, adding 0.7 per cent and 0.5 per cent to close at €8.90 and 0.5 per cent per share, respectively. Ryanair, off the pace earlier in the week, jumped by more than 3 per cent, part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. In what was a theme across European indices, home builders also advanced on Thursday. Cairn Homes jumped by almost 1 per cent to €2.01 per share while Glenveagh Properties added 0.5 per cent to close at almost €1.90. Cavan insulation giant Kingspan, meanwhile, surged again, adding 1.9 per cent to €75.30. European shares advanced, despite a decline in tech stocks after Oracle released disappointing results in the US. The blue-chip Stoxx 50 was up 0.8 per cent while the pan-European Stoxx 600 added 0.5 per cent. The big names in European banking gained, led by Spain’s BBVA, which jumped by 2.3 per cent. Its domestic competitor Santander also moved higher, while Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, the Netherlands’ ING Groep, and France’s BNP Paribas all added between 1.6 per cent and 2.1 per cent. Utilities stocks slid, dragged lower by a more than 6 per cent drop in Spain’s Naturgy Energy after BlackRock ⁠sold a 7.1 per cent stake in the Spanish gas utility for around 1.7 billion euros. After Oracle’s disappointing results reignited concerns about an artificial intelligence investment bubble, European tech shares also dipped. Germany’s SAP and Infineon fell by 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively, and Dutch chipmaker ASML dipped 0.5 per cent. UK shares were subdued, with both the blue-chip FTSE 100 and mid-cap FTSE 250 indices eking out modest gains. Healthcare ⁠stocks on the FTSE 100 added momentum, with AstraZeneca up 0.5 per cent and ConvaTec adding 1.7 per cent. Miners also gained, tracking a rise ‍in copper prices. In line with trends across Europe, stocks linked to the economic cycle performed well, with the big UK banks all advancing. Barclays gained 1.1 per cent, while Lloyds and NatWest Group also inched higher. Retail stocks were weaker, with Next losing 0.8 per cent, while Frasers dipped by a further 1 per cent after Mike Ashley pledged around £670 million (€765 million) worth of shares in the group as collateral for an HSBC loan. Two of Wall Street’s three main indices were on track to fall on Thursday as some of the world’s biggest tech stocks dipped after Oracle plunged 14 per cent. Fresh concerns about Oracle’s sizeable outlay on artificial intelligence largely overshadowed the Fed’s decision to cut rates again, after the tech giant published quarterly forecasts that fell short of analyst expectations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell by around 1 per cent, putting it on pace for its biggest decline in more than a month. The S&P 500, meanwhile, fell by 0.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent. Caution toward AI heavyweights persisted, with Nvidia down by around 3.5 per cent amid Magnificent Seven losses. Among others, Walt Disney gained 2 per cent after the streaming firm said it would make a $1 billion (€850 million) equity investment in OpenAI. AI ‌bubble concerns also hurt crypto stocks such as Strategy, which lost 3.3 per cent, and Bit Digital, which fell 3.1 per cent as bitcoin briefly slipped below $90,000. – Additional reporting: Bloomberg, Reuters Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Top 5 Stocks Impacted by Potential Armed Conflict With Venezuela

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The United States has assembled its largest military presence in the Caribbean since 1989, with more than 15,000 troops deployed near Venezuela. Following the December 10 seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker and ongoing strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, $36 million in trading volume on prediction markets tracking US-Venezuela military engagement signals serious investor concern about potential armed conflict. A military confrontation would create immediate winners and losers across defense and energy sectors. Defense contractors would benefit from increased equipment demand and contract expansions, while energy companies face initial oil price spikes followed by potential long-term supply increases if regime change occurs. Let me be clear, I don’t want a conflict here. But part of my job is to help inform you how global events connect to your financial well-being, and that’s what I’m going to show you below. Lockheed Martin stands as the primary beneficiary of any Venezuela military engagement. The company’s $109.2 billion market cap and specialization in precision strike missiles, military aircraft, and missile defense systems position it directly for contract expansions during regional conflicts. LMT beat Q3 2025 earnings estimates by 9.45%, delivering $6.95 per share against expectations of $6.35. Revenue reached $18.61 billion with an 11.7% operating margin. The company has beaten earnings in seven of the last eight quarters with an average surprise of 8.9%. LMT’s forward P/E of 15 compared to its trailing 26.1 suggests analysts expect significant earnings acceleration. The stock trades at $467, roughly 3% below its year-to-date high of $482. Wall Street maintains four Strong Buy and four Buy ratings, setting a $527 price target that implies 13% upside. Any Caribbean military operation would likely involve LMT’s F-35 fighters, Aegis missile defense systems, and precision munitions. The company’s extremely low beta of 0.241 provides defensive characteristics while offering conflict-related upside. RTX’s integrated defense portfolio makes it the second-most exposed defense contractor. The company’s $234.3 billion market cap reflects diversified revenue streams across Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and the Raytheon defense segment. Q3 2025 results showcased exceptional momentum: revenue of $22.48 billion beat estimates of $21.32 billion by 5.4%, while EPS of $1.70 exceeded expectations of $1.41. The Raytheon segment posted $7.05 billion in sales, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow reached $4.64 billion with a $251 billion backlog providing multi-year revenue visibility. RTX raised full-year 2025 guidance to $86.5-87.0 billion in sales with EPS of $6.10-6.20. The company’s 29.4% quarterly earnings growth year-over-year significantly outpaces LMT’s 2.2%, though it commands a premium valuation at 35.9x trailing P/E. The company’s missile systems, including air defense and precision strike capabilities, would be central to any Caribbean operations. Analysts maintain four Strong Buy and nine Buy ratings with zero Sell ratings. Northrop Grumman’s $79.52 billion market cap and specialization in autonomous systems, C4ISR, and space-based assets provide unique exposure to modern conflict scenarios requiring advanced technology integration. Q3 2025 results showed mixed performance: revenue of $10.42 billion missed estimates of $10.82 billion, but EPS of $7.67 beat expectations of $6.52 by 17.7%. The company demonstrated strong operational efficiency with a 13.2% operating margin and free cash flow of $1.26 billion, up 72% year-over-year. Management raised 2025 EPS guidance to $25.65-26.05. The Mission Systems segment generated $3.09 billion in Q3 (up 10%), and Defense Systems reached $2.06 billion (up 14%). NOC’s unmanned systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated battle management systems would support intelligence gathering and precision strike operations near Venezuela. The company’s higher operating margin of 13.2% compared to LMT’s 11.7% demonstrates superior operational leverage. Exxon Mobil represents the most compelling energy play for Venezuela conflict scenarios, though with complex risk dynamics. The $509.6 billion energy giant would face immediate headwinds from supply disruptions but potential long-term benefits if regime change enables sanctions relief and field access. Analysts project an immediate oil price spike from current levels near $59 per barrel toward $70-75 if conflict disrupts Venezuela’s 900,000 barrels per day of exports. XOM’s massive scale, producing revenues of $326.2 billion over the trailing twelve months, positions it to capture significant margin expansion from price increases. The company’s 9.18% profit margin would expand meaningfully with crude prices 20-25% higher. Q3 2025 results showed cyclical headwinds: quarterly earnings declined 8.3% year-over-year and revenue fell 5.1% as oil prices retreated from summer highs of $75.89 in June to current levels around $59. Venezuela holds over 300 billion barrels of proven reserves, 17% of the global total. If U.S. intervention leads to regime change and sanctions relief, XOM could potentially access Venezuelan heavy crude fields. The company’s Gulf Coast refineries are specifically calibrated for Venezuelan heavy crude. However, this supply increase could eventually pressure prices lower. XOM’s 3.35% dividend yield provides income stability, while its forward P/E of 16.1 suggests reasonable valuation. Chevron’s unique position as the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela under sanctions waivers makes it the most directly exposed energy stock to conflict scenarios. The company’s $305.06 billion market cap and existing Venezuelan operations create both immediate risks and potential opportunities. Q3 2025 results showed production strength offsetting price pressures: revenue of $49.73 billion met estimates while EPS of $1.85 beat expectations of $1.73. Adjusted earnings of $3.6 billion declined from $4.5 billion year-over-year due to lower crude prices, but production surged 21% to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day following Hess acquisition integration. Armed conflict would immediately threaten CVX’s Venezuelan operations and personnel. However, the company’s existing infrastructure and relationships position it as the primary beneficiary if regime change enables expanded operations. CVX’s 6.77% profit margin and 4.55% dividend yield, the highest among covered stocks, provide some downside protection. The $36 million trading volume on Polymarket’s Venezuela military engagement contracts, with $16.5 million traded in the past week alone, indicates sophisticated investors are seriously pricing conflict risk. Defense contractors present clearer upside scenarios with limited downside. All three companies have raised 2025 guidance, maintain substantial backlogs, and demonstrate consistent execution. The sector’s defensive characteristics, evidenced by LMT’s 0.241 beta, provide portfolio stability while offering conflict-related catalysts. Energy stocks face more complex dynamics. Initial conflict would spike oil prices from depressed $59 levels toward $70-75, benefiting all producers. However, successful regime change could eventually increase global supply by 1 million barrels per day over a decade, pressuring prices lower. Defense stocks present asymmetric risk-reward characteristics: limited downside given strong fundamentals and significant upside if conflict escalates. Energy stocks present more complex positioning dynamics, with short-term tactical opportunities during price spikes but longer-term supply concerns if regime change succeeds.

Oracle's (ORCL) stock tumbled Thursday, dragging other tech stocks down along with it, a day after the cloud computing giant posted sales that missed analysts' estimates. Oracle said new agreements with AI heavyweights Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) helped grow its backlog to a record $523 billion, though that failed to sway investors from selling off Thursday amid persistent worries about circular AI deals and the company's reliance on a few large customers. Shares of Oracle were down nearly 14% in recent trading. AI hardware makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO)—which is set to report earnings after the closing bell today—also lost ground. Oracle shares rallied to a record high following its earnings report in September, but the stock has given up those gains in the months since amid growing worries about an AI bubble. Oracle's stock plunge Thursday despite a record backlog and pressure on other AI-exposed stocks could be taken as a signal of weakening confidence in the AI trade. Still, most Wall Street analysts say they're standing by Oracle's stock. Though ratings are still in flux, a majority of the 12 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha consider the stock a "buy" with just three neutral ratings and one analyst advising selling the stock. William Blair analysts wrote following the report that while they expect Oracle's stock could be limited in the near term by debt concerns and spending plans, they believe its buildout "will pave the way for significant earnings growth in the years to come."

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Tokenization Trends

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Harvey Li from Tokenization Insights takes us through tokenization trends, money market funds, and institutional adoption as we head into 2026. Then, in "Ask an Expert," Michael Sena looks at what it means for investors with BlackRock’s announced plans to tokenize everything from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to real estate. - Sarah Morton Tokenization entered a new phase in 2025. What started as an experiment is now becoming a functional part of institutional infrastructure, led by banks and asset managers who aren’t waiting for a tokenized future — they’re building it. One specific product category has emerged as the clear front-runner: tokenized money market funds (MMFs). Tokenized MMFs are quickly becoming the core on-chain liquidity instrument for institutions, treasurers, and sophisticated funds. They bridge traditional short-term U.S. Treasury exposure with digital settlement, programmable workflows, and real-time portability. Growth is real: And institutions are incorporating tokenized MMF into businesses: Momentum is building, but the real story is what comes next in 2026. 1. Regulatory validation and collateral eligibility The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC)Global Markets Advisory Committee recommended tokenized MMFs as eligible collateral, and Acting Chair Caroline Pham launched a dedicated initiative in late 2025 to advance tokenized collateral adoption. If tokenized MMFs become approved as eligible margin collateral, recognized for cleared derivatives, swaps, and repo and embedded into CCP and FCM rulebooks, then tokenized MMFs evolve from a cash-parking tool into core institutional collateral, the same category that fuels trillions in daily financing today. This is a major unlock for banks, brokers, hedge funds, and trading venues that need intraday settlement and programmable liquidity. 2. The “institutional legitimacy” moment Seventy institutions, including State Street, Fnality, Franklin Templeton, and UBS, contributed to Global Digital Finance’s November 2025 report and demonstrated that tokenized MMFs can be: 3. The rise of tokenized cash rails at major banks Until recently, tokenized MMFs could only be redeemed via traditional banking rails or stablecoins. That is changing quickly. In 2025, we saw: As tokenized cash rails mature, institutions will be able to move tokenized MMF to tokenized deposit and settlement cash within the same ecosystem, with no friction and no conversion back to legacy payment rails or stablecoins. That is the moment when tokenized MMFs stop being a crypto-adjacent product and become digital liquidity management blocks for institutions. 4. Regulatory momentum for U.S.D and EUR stablecoins While tokenized institutional cash rails are rapidly expanding, stablecoin policy and legislation are helping stablecoins become the default cash rail for public permissionless space: Once these frameworks settle and SMEs become more comfortable with leveraging stablecoins for cash purposes, tokenized money market funds naturally become the yield, collateral, treasury, and portfolio cash solution. The direction of travel is clear. Cash that used to sit in bank accounts or legacy MMF portals is now being re-packaged into programmable instruments that plug directly into digital asset rails, and tokenized money market funds are becoming the cash management and collateral solution for all tokenized cash forms: tokenized bank deposits, deposit tokens and stablecoins. 2025 was the breakout year for tokenized money market funds as an asset class.2026 looks to be the acceleration phase, when tokenized MMFs become a standard treasury, settlement, and collateral asset for institutions. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q: Traditionally, U.S. ETFs follow Wall Street’s market hours and settle through their clearing houses. What are the benefits and hurdles BlackRock’s investors will face in terms of round-the-clock trading? A: 24/7 trading will change everything from staffing to risk management. When markets never close, it changes the way you need to operate. The benefits of real-time markets means that those who can react first will be able to capture the bulk of moves in asset prices. Q: The tokenized asset market is still insignificant compared to the trillion-dollar U.S. ETF industry. How will BlackRock’s participation contribute to the tokenization ecosystem? A: BlackRock’s massive asset portfolio will instantly increase the overall value represented by the tokenized ecosystem. More than that, it brings credibility to all types of blockchain-based assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q: BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been bullish on asset tokenization and wants to tokenize almost every traditional asset. Is tokenization a move to extend better services to investors or maintain its hegemony as the largest asset manager? A: BlackRock clearly sees the future of tokenized assets and all the benefits they bring: reduced operational overhead, increased efficiency, and more trust. Most of a large asset manager’s business isn’t in front-facing markets, but is in clearing, settlement, and other types of back and middle office operations.

Title: Steve Ballmer’s Net Worth Up $20 Billion on Microsoft’s Success
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/11/steve-ballmers-net-worth-up-20-billion-on-microsofts-success/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Francois Durand / Getty Images News via Getty Images Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), has a net worth of $166 billion, up $20 billion this year. That makes him the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list. The secret of the rise is simple. Ballmer kept a large portion of his shares in Microsoft when he left the company in 2014. At the time, he had been the chief executive officer for 14 years. He was also one of the first people Bill Gates hired after he started the company. Today, Ballmer owns 4% of Microsoft, which makes him the company’s largest individual shareholder. Microsoft has a market value of $3.56 trillion. That makes it the fourth most valuable company in the world, just behind Alphabet and ahead of Amazon.

Title: Bitcoin and equity futures fall alongside mining stocks as Oracle leads AI stock decline

Cryptocurrency prices and equity futures retreated on Thursday morning, signaling a negative start for major indices. Bitcoin fell 2.11% to $90,090, setting a bearish tone for digital asset miners, while a sharp decline in Oracle shares weighed heavily on the broader AI sector. Bitcoin mining equities tracked the drop in spot cryptocurrency prices, facing widespread losses in pre-market trading. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) led the decline, falling 3.03% and 3.19%, respectively. MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) dropped 2.6%, while TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) and IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) posted losses of roughly 2.5% each. Other industry participants followed the sector-wide sell-off. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) dropped 2.38%, Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) declined 2.02%, and Americant Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) fell 1.04%. Artificial intelligence stocks faced significant selling pressure, driven primarily by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which plummeted 13.18%. A Reuters report on December 11 revealed that the sell-off came after Oracle’s quarterly cloud revenue miss, despite year-over-year growth. Compounding investor concerns, the company raised its capital expenditure outlook to $50 billion for 2026 to fund AI infrastructure, a move market observers noted would add to an existing debt load. The negative sentiment impacted other AI leaders, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) falling 1.59%. Oracle also highlighted reliance on a limited number of large partners, such as OpenAI, raising concerns regarding concentration risk. The weakness in tech and crypto dragged down broader market futures. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.32% and Nasdaq futures decreased 0.52% in early trading hours, positioning the markets for a lower open.

It says a lot about the ever-bullish outlook of Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood that she predicted bitcoin to reach $1.2 million by 2030, and it was, in fact, a downgrade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. Cathie Wood made her forecast for BTC's price in November 2025, slightly revising the target down from $1.5 million based on the explosive rise of stablecoins, which she claimed may usurp some of bitcoin's value as a transactional instrument. Her impact on cryptocurrency goes beyond her notoriously bullish predictions, however. Ark's spot bitcoin ETF, which it listed in partnership with 21Shares, is the third-largest such product in the U.S. behind only the runaway market leaders provided by asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity. Wood's optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency industry is evident in the holdings of some of Ark's largest ETFs. The firm’s $8.4 billion Innovation ETF counts crypto exchange Coinbase among its largest holdings, as do two of Ark's other largest ETFs by net assets. The initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025 of stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish (the parent company of CoinDesk) also prompted sizeable investments by Ark. Through its ETFs, Ark and, by extension, Wood, who also holds the role of chief investment officer (CIO), may represent a North Star for understanding which disruptive technologies are likely to provide the most lucrative high-growth plays.

Title: Biggest Themes For Broadcom Heading Into Earnings

Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:48:01Z

Live Blog Update #5 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2.

The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space.

The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Nvidia’s ‘Secret Portfolio’ Is Tanking. This Is the Only Stock Still Winning

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / rafapress Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quietly built a strategic investment portfolio not many investors are aware of targeting companies that enhance its AI ecosystem, from chip design to data infrastructure. This “secret” portfolio holds six positions that were valued at $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. These stakes back firms developing complementary technologies, such as GPU-optimized cloud services and AI-driven biotech. However, Q3 brought challenges amid a broader AI market pause, with hyperscalers reassessing capex and investor sentiment cooling. The portfolio shed nearly $500 million in the quarter, an 11% drop, as four of six holdings declined, most sharply. Since Q3 ended in September, though, the slide deepened, with the overall value plunging 30% more to about $2.7 billion — a $1.1 billion loss. Only one holding defied the trend: Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD). Nvidia’s portfolio woes stem largely from its largest bet, the AI cloud provider reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for training large models, CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV). At Q2’s close, Nvidia’s 24.3 million shares were worth $3.96 billion, over 91% of the portfolio. But CoreWeave’s stock has cratered amid debt concerns and AI hype fatigue. Since Q3’s end, it’s down 36%, and 46% from Q2 levels, now trading around $88 per share after peaking at $187 earlier in 2025. This single position accounts for most of the portfolio’s quarter-over-quarter decline. Other holdings fared little better. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), a chip architecture designer, slipped 12.5% since Q3 amid slower mobile demand. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX), using AI for drug discovery, dropped 5.7% on clinical trial delays, and WeRide (NASDAQ:WRD), an autonomous driving firm, fell 17% as regulatory hurdles mounted. The portfolio’s diversification into AI adjacencies hasn’t shielded it from sector-wide pressures like rising energy costs and delayed enterprise rollouts. Amid the rubble, two positions posted gains, with Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) delivering solid returns. Formerly tied to former Russian search giant Yandex, Nebius now builds AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters. Nvidia’s 1.2 million shares, valued at $65.9 million at the end of Q2, have surged 69% since then, boosted by a $17 billion Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) deal for cloud capacity. Nebius’s Q3 revenue jumped 355% year-over-year to $146 million, underscoring its switch to AI hyperscaler needs. However, the stock has fallen 17% since the end of Q3. Yet Applied Digital outpaces even Nebius as the portfolio’s undisputed star. Nvidia’s 7.7 million shares, worth $77.7 million at Q2 close, have rocketed 128% quarter-over-quarter and another 35% since Q3, for a staggering 208% total gain. Now valued at over $239 million, this stake has single-handedly offset some broader losses. Applied Digital designs and operates data centers tailored for high-performance computing, powering AI and blockchain workloads. Its Polaris Forge campus in North Dakota delivers 100 megawatts of capacity, drawing clients like CoreWeave for GPU-intensive builds. In a market where AI stocks like CoreWeave and even Arm are falling, sometimes as much as 40% or more, Applied Digital’s ability to keep going stands out. Its fiscal Q1 2026 results, reported in October, crushed Wall Street estimates. Revenue hit $64.2 million, up 84% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $5.85 million. Net losses narrowed to $36.1 million, far better than feared. The main driver was relentless data center demand. AI training requires massive, power-efficient facilities, and Applied Digital benefits directly from hyperscaler buildouts, including contracts with CoreWeave for colocation. Its sustainable designs, using renewable energy, align with ESG mandates that pressure rivals. Crypto also added tailwinds. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) demand spiked after the halving, especially as its price briefly soared above $126,000, contributing to increased demand for data center capacity. As pure AI plays pause amid valuation resets, Applied Digital’s hybrid model — 60% high-performance computing and AI, 40% crypto — provides a buffer. Analysts project 28% EBITDA growth in fiscal 2026, with $16 billion in existing five-year leases, giving it good visibility into revenue for the years ahead. Trading at 30x forward sales, it’s carrying a lot of investor expectations with it. Although Applied Digital is still generating losses, they narrowed significantly in Q3 and it projects an annual net operating income run rate of $1 billion by 2030. Applied Digital’s outperformance is the result of focused execution. However, its continued success depends on navigating the AI slowdown, potentially crimping data center leases if clients like Microsoft trim budgets. The crypto winter could bite as well, as Bitcoin’s near-30% pullback echoes 2022’s bear market, possibly idling mining rigs and pressuring margins. Still, the upside potential outweighs risks. Nvidia’s endorsement validates its tech, so if AI capex continues strong next year — as Nvidia forecasts it will — Applied Digital could double again.

Reports suggests "a dozen" employees have been made redundant from Guildford-based studio Around "a dozen" employees at Glowmade are reportedly facing layoffs. That's according to Insider Gaming, which has seen documentation suggesting that the launch of the studio's title King of Meat "failed to meet internal expectations by a significant margin." Sources claim leadership at the Guildford-based developer expected "a concurrent player count of at least 100,000" for the game on Steam, but it "failed to hit 1,000 consistently across all platforms" with a concurrent player peak of 320 on SteamDB. As a result, the studio reportedly "began discussions with staff about voluntary redundancies earlier this month, affecting around a dozen people." GamesIndustry.biz has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment. Glowmade was founded in 2015 by three developers from Lionhead Studios. In 2021, the independent studio partnered with Amazon Game Studios as part of its expansion into third-party publishing. Amazon Games would go on to publish King of Meat, which launched in October 2025. Last August GamesIndustry.biz spoke to Amazon's EMEA publishing director Jon Rosenblatt about its games strategy, and how King of Meat fit within its plans. "It's really important for us to continue to build amazing games, but also make sure that the games are diverse in their look and their feel," said Rosenblatt. "King of Meat was just an ideal opportunity for us to work with a very talented team in Guildford, and really grow that game out into something much bigger than maybe they have planned."

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors

Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:18:48Z
Full Content:
One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture.

Title: Climate Skeptics Rush to Misuse Texas v. BlackRock
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/12/11/climate-skeptics-rush-to-misuse-texas-v-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:06:37Z

Texas v. BlackRock (E.D. Tex.) (BlackRock), a case in which 11 states claim that the institutional-investor defendants colluded to profit through coordinated output reductions at coal companies they partially owned, remains in its early stages, with discovery continuing through 2027. Already however, opponents of climate-risk mitigation have rushed to extract specious theories of antitrust harm from Judge Kernodle’s partial denial of the motion to dismiss (the BlackRock MTD decision). Following procedural requirements, Judge Kernodle took as true plaintiffs’ allegations that the BlackRock defendants joined climate alliances and pursued related mitigation goals that “necessarily result in the reduction of coal output.” Judge Kernodle also found plausible plaintiffs’ allegations of antitrust harm to consumers, as reflected in rising prices during a period of decreased production by the relevant coal companies. Judge Kernodle did note that BlackRock may possess a valid defense to these allegations, stemming from long-term declines in coal consumption. But interests aligned with the BlackRock plaintiffs already have assembled a house-of-cards antitrust argument that any institutional investor factoring climate risk into its business decisions should face heightened scrutiny on routine portfolio acquisitions. A neutral analysis of the BlackRock MTD decision does not justify imposing such legal burdens, which would hinder these investors’ capacity to compete against their climate-indifferent rivals. This post seeks to clarify: (1) why the BlackRock MTD decision remains far from proclaiming institutional investors’ every climate consideration a proven anticompetitive output reduction; and (2) why institutional investors’ “solely for investment” exemption from antitrust scrutiny still permits these investors to promote a wide range of climate-risk mitigation measures. The BlackRock complaint contains multiple antitrust claims. The plaintiffs assert violations under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, claiming each defendant used its partial ownership of coal companies in a manner reasonably likely to reduce competition, to consumers’ detriment. Plaintiffs also assert violations under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, claiming defendants collectively agreed to coerce the coal companies’ implementation of a coordinated output reduction (reducing coal supply in order to intensify demand, raise prices, and boost profit margins). And Plaintiffs assert violations under state antitrust laws (not covered by this blog post). Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that the Texas complaint’s “first of its kind” allegation of a “horizontal agreement among investors to pressure competitors in another industry to reduce output” [italics in original] does not call for per se antitrust analysis (an approach which assumes the anticompetitive harms of a given activity, and only considers whether defendants engaged in that activity). Instead, the court will conduct an elaborate rule-of-reason balancing, to “divin[e] the procompetitive or anticompetitive effects” of these defendants’ business arrangements. Judge Kernodle makes clear that “weighty economics questions” remain to be resolved in later stages of litigation. Those questions will likely focus on defining an appropriate market to measure the competitive effects of defendants’ actions, determining whether plaintiffs have persuasively pinpointed how defendants’ actions harmed competition in these markets, and assessing defendants’ claims of procompetitive benefits. To scrutinize antitrust defendants’ effects on competition, courts typically first define a particular market in which the purported harm occurred or might occur. Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that defendants did not contest “at this stage” of litigation the plaintiffs’ proposed focus on the markets for South Powder River Basin coal, and thermal coal. Yet defendants may have good reason to contest these market definitions at subsequent stages. Consideration of a broader market (one encompassing a wide range of energy sources that satisfy the relevant consumers’ needs) could allow defendants to argue that modernization and diversification of product options in order to meet shifting economic conditions (such as mounting climate risk), have not, on balance, harmed energy consumers. By extension, defendants might call into question the status of coal-company output decisions as a but-for cause of consumer harm, by pointing to across-the-board price increases for a diverse array of energy products. Alternately, if defendants could show that rising coal prices coincided with increased demand for substitutable energy products (such as renewable power, nuclear power, and/or natural gas), this also may weaken the plaintiffs’ claims of harm to consumers or to competition. The BlackRock plaintiffs will face additional challenges meeting their burden of persuasion as this case progresses. The defendants only need to poke holes in plaintiffs’ theory of harm. The defendants might start, for example, from plaintiffs’ argumentative reliance on: “different responses…exhibited by…publicly held companies…whose shares Defendants acquired and who cut their output during a period of rising prices…and…privately held companies, who raised their output.” This facile comparison between publicly and privately owned coal companies looks easily contestable. The plaintiffs must convince the court that broader economic trends would not have prompted these same disparities between public and private coal companies’ output. But given the escalating societal concerns and conspicuous financial risks associated with an emissions-intensive energy source like coal, public companies’ greater susceptibility to reputational costs (alongside their added disclosure obligations) may incentivize such categorical differences in output. That certainly offers a simpler account than the elaborate conspiracy plaintiffs allege, in which institutional investors promised transformational clean-tech innovations, pushed for robust emissions reporting while faking their focus on climate mitigation, and cynically captured inflated profits by peddling dirty fuels. The BlackRock plaintiffs also advance tenuous antitrust causation claims through their frequent conflations of defendants’ alleged coal-reduction, emissions-reduction, and net-zero pledges. This misapplies antitrust’s output-reduction concerns to restraints on firms’ negative externalities (greenhouse-gas byproducts), rather than on their supplying of economic goods (carbon-based energy sources). To date, Judge Kernodle has taken as true plaintiffs’ assertion that a pledge to reduce coal emissions “necessarily means cutting coal production because ‘there is no realistic path for a coal company to cut coal emissions other than by cutting production.’” Yet regardless of whether one doubts the fossil-fuel industry’s pledges of near-term clean-coal deployment, we consider it unlikely that a merits-stage court analysis would give the plaintiffs’ brusque, future-oriented pronouncement of “no realistic path” much factual weight in proving present market harms. We likewise find it ironic that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has signed off (both as a licensed attorney, and as an accountable public official) not only on this sweeping denial of clean-coal boosterism, but also on a recent letter celebrating President Trump’s “BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL” [capitalization in original] agenda. Nor do AG Paxton’s questionable claims stop there. In fact, the BlackRock complaint comes closest to demonstrating an agreement to reduce coal output (rather than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) by repeatedly misrepresenting plaintiffs’ own evidence on this topic. For but one example, the complaint brazenly cherry-picks from a Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) document, so that NZAM appears to call on its members (including each BlackRock defendant) to “immediately ceas[e] all financial or other support to coal companies…building new coal infrastructure.” Yet plaintiffs fail to disclose that the cited NZAM document does not require this particular approach. The approach is one of five climate-mitigation strategies that NZAM signatories are expected to choose from (other options include a “phase out” of thermal-coal investments on an unspecified timeline, or “restricting financing for unabated coal power generation, i.e. without carbon capture and storage”). Judge Kernodle’s MTD decision, in turn, cites this NZAM quotation in multiple passages, at times reading it as an express NZAM requirement, rather than as a nonbinding option. Later stages of litigation will allow defendants to question whether membership in a climate alliance that permits an open-ended “phase out” of coal investments has evidentiary value in a lawsuit claiming real-world market effects between 2019 and 2022—and whether plaintiffs established that evidence in bad faith. Former Congressmember (and ranking Republican on the House of Representatives’ Antitrust Subcommittee) Ken Buck has catalogued further ways in which “the facts dispute the allegations,” including: no relevant coal-company manager being removed by proxy vote during the complaint’s timeframe; certain defendants never voting against a single director; and purportedly colluding defendants consistently voting differently from each other. Should plaintiffs navigate these impediments to presenting a persuasive causal chain that culminates in anticompetitive effects, they still will need to address defendants’ procompetitive defenses. Multiple procompetitive rationales for corporate climate pledges present themselves, particularly for pledges to reduce emissions. To begin with, given regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. on coal emissions, as well as increasingly strict greenhouse-gas regimes in other advanced economies, reducing industry emissions (especially through lower emissions intensity) may facilitate continued coal production, under whatever constraints the industry finds itself facing. Moreover, the net-zero commitments in this case’s climate pledges need not even commit a signatory to reduced coal emissions (let alone reduced coal output), since by definition “net-zero” calculations balance GHG additions to, and removals from, the atmosphere (with possibilities for offsets). Defendants also may argue that collective emissions pledges improve the quality of each investor firm’s offerings, and follow antitrust law on standard-setting by “encourag[ing] competition with cleaner, more innovative, or more transparent products.” Along related lines, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the Antitrust Agencies) statement-of-interest filing on the BlackRock MTD sets the stage for a green-transition procompetitive defense, particularly in investment markets: “an institutional investor…could advocate in favor of the business in which it owns…stock to exit one market in favor of another, more profitable market [and] could even pressure the management of the firm to undertake such a transition [so long as this transition] would reduce output in the first market in service of achieving higher profits in another.” This logic leaves ample room for institutional-investor defendants with substantial coal holdings to persuade the court that they did not seek to self-destruct by advocating a net-zero transition—but instead to increase profits (and improve their own investment products) by calling for energy-sector innovation that better fits evolving economic circumstances. Amid these daunting challenges still faced by the BlackRock plaintiffs, climate denialists already have doubled down on dubious antitrust rationales for stifling emissions-mitigation and disclosure initiatives. The “woke alert” advocacy organization Consumers’ Research, for example, sent a September letter to the Antitrust Agencies, celebrating Judge Kernodle’s “vindicat[ion]” of the agencies’ BlackRock statement, which primarily argued that defendants overstated antitrust law’s exemption from Section 7 scrutiny, provided to stock acquisitions made “solely for investment.” Consumers’ Research highlights the Antitrust Agencies’ assertion that “an investment is not ‘solely for investment’ if an investor has an intent to use stock to influence significantly or control management of the target firm.” Yet from this measured premise, Consumers’ Research mischaracterizes many reasonable business efforts to reduce climate risk as suspicious “mixed motive” practices demanding enhanced antitrust scrutiny. These suspect practices would include: an institutional investor’s public statement encouraging clarity in corporations’ greenhouse-gas reduction targets; an institutional investor’s voting of shares against incumbent directors who fail to pursue net-zero alignment; and even an investor’s mere vote for annual emissions disclosures like those increasingly required in most advanced economies. This legal pivot from anticompetitive harms and managerial control (in the Antitrust Agencies’ statement), to a much broader array of climate-minded “business decisions,” would vastly restrict the shareholder rights of institutional investors and their clients, while harming competition in investment markets by capriciously targeting firms that engage in broad categories of risk analysis. By contrast, the Antitrust Agencies’ BlackRock statement offered multiple indications that “conferring with directors and management on best practices for…oversight processes,” or using “investment holdings and market status to influence or change…public reporting practices,” does not inevitably depart from Section 7 solely-for-investment standards. Rather, these actions confirm the “critical role in corporate governance matters” played by institutional investors. Subsequent rounds of the Texas v. BlackRock litigation hopefully will clarify that such investors need not sit on their hands as the world burns.

Title: US jobless benefit applications jump to 236,000, continuing claims lowest since April

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but the total number of those collecting benefits fell to the lowest level in eight months WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but the total number of those collecting benefits fell to the lowest level in eight months. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate another quarter-point, its third straight cut to close out there year. The Fed has been slashing borrowing costs to prop up the slowing labor market. The Labor Department's report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock filed for a staking-enabled Ethereum (ETH) trust on Dec. 5, which reframes the question of what kind of risk stack institutional investors will accept. The document outlines a structure that requires allocators to price three distinct failure modes simultaneously. First, protocol-level slashing penalties can hit the trust's vault account with no guarantee of full recovery. Second, a multi-entity custody arrangement where a trade credit lender holds first-priority liens over trust assets and can liquidate positions if credits aren't repaid on time. Third, a variable yield stream in which the sponsor controls how much ether is staked versus held in liquid form, creating a direct tension between the trust's redemption needs and the sponsor's staking-related fees. The filing seems like a bet that institutional buyers will treat Ethereum validator risk the way they've learned to treat counterparty risk in prime brokerage: as manageable, diversifiable, and worth paying someone else to monitor. BlackRock plans to stake 70% to 90% of the trust's ETH through “provider-facilitated staking,” selecting operators based on uptime and slashing history. The S-1 acknowledges that slashed assets are debited directly from the vault and that any compensatory payments from providers may not fully cover losses. The language leaves open how much residual risk investors ultimately absorb and whether the sponsor would cut staking levels materially if validator risk climbs. That matters because slashing doesn't hurt through the raw ETH destroyed, but through the second-order behavior it triggers. An isolated slashing event is written off as an operator-quality problem, while a correlated slashing event, such as a client bug that takes down validators across multiple providers, becomes a system-trust problem. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum's validator churn is rate-limited. Liquid staking tokens can trade at steep discounts as holders scramble for immediate liquidity while market makers pull back. Institutional allocators are demanding clearer indemnities, proof of multi-client failover, and explicit backstops, which are pushing fees higher and separating “institutional-grade” operators from everyone else. The custody structure adds another layer. The trust routes assets through an ETH custodian, a prime execution agent, and a trade credit lender, with the option to move to an additional custodian if needed. To secure trade credits, the trust grants a first-priority lien over both its trading and vault balances. If a credit isn't repaid on time, the lender can seize and liquidate assets, burning through the trading balance first. The dynamic creates a claim-priority question in fast markets: who gets paid when, and what happens if service relationships are restricted or terminated? The filing notes that insurance programs may be shared across clients rather than dedicated to the trust, which weakens the comfort level for large allocators. Settlement timing adds friction. Moving ETH from the vault to the trading balance occurs on-chain to prevent network congestion from delaying redemptions. That's not theoretical, as Ethereum has seen periodic gas spikes that would bottleneck large fund flows. On yield, the trust will distribute staking consideration net of fees at least quarterly, but the exact fee split remains redacted in the draft filing. The S-1 flags a conflict of interest: the sponsor earns more when staking levels run higher, but the trust needs liquidity to meet redemptions. There's no guarantee of rewards, and past returns don't predict future ones. The filing implicitly prices three scenarios, each with different effects on validator fees and liquidity. Under normal operations, staking looks boring. Exit queues stay manageable, withdrawals happen on schedule, and liquid staking tokens trade near fair value with small discounts that reflect general risk appetite. Additionally, operator fees stay tight as providers compete on uptime, client diversity, and reporting quality rather than charging explicit insurance premiums. Reputation and operational diligence drive pricing more than tail risk. A minor, isolated slashing event nudges the equilibrium but doesn't break it, causing only a small direct economic loss. Some providers quietly rebate fees or absorb the hit to preserve institutional relationships, and demand drifts toward higher-assurance operators. The result is a modest fee dispersion between top-tier and mid-tier setups. Liquid staking token discounts might widen briefly, but liquidity mechanics stay smooth. The effect typically fades within days or weeks unless it exposes deeper operational flaws. A major, correlated slashing event resets risk pricing entirely, and institutional allocators demand stronger multi-client diversification, proof of failover, and explicit slashing backstops. The best-capitalized or most trusted operators gain pricing power and can charge higher fees. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum limits the number of validators who can leave per epoch. Liquid staking tokens trade at deep discounts as holders chase immediate liquidity and market makers protect themselves against uncertain redemption timing and further losses. The system can appear liquid on paper while feeling illiquid in practice. Confidence and pricing can take weeks to months to normalize, even after the technical issue resolves. A staked Ethereum ETF will likely operate in the “normal-ops” regime most of the time, but the market will embed a small haircut into its staking yield to account for tail risk. That haircut widens in a major slashing scenario due to both lower expected net yields and a higher liquidity premium demanded by investors. The question isn't whether BlackRock can execute the mechanics, but whether the structure shifts enough demand toward “institutional-grade” staking to create a new fee tier and liquidity regime. If it does, the validators who win institutional flows will be the ones who can credibly price and manage correlated risk, not just run nodes reliably. The losers will be mid-tier operators who can't afford the insurance, reporting infrastructure, or client diversification that allocators will start requiring. Wall Street will pay for Ethereum yield if someone else owns the operational and protocol risk.

Title: So Trump Seized A Venezuelan Oil Tanker?
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/so-trump-seized-a-venezuelan-oil
Time Published: 2025-12-11T13:55:40Z
Full Content:
Excuse me, what in the Somali pirate?! Donald John Trump, commander in chief of these United States, claimed on Wednesday that the US Coast Guard has seized a Venezuelan oil tanker. And the US is going to keep the oil! And he’ll do it again! Was the oil tanker full of liquefied fentanyl it was coming to squirt on the US? No! Was it engaging in hostilities? No again. It was full of oil from PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned facilities, chugging between Venezuela and Cuba, reportedly en route to Asian oil brokers. Seems Trump has now forgotten all about that fake “fentanyl” pretense now. Subscribe to Wonkette for all your WARBLOGGING needs! It sounds like legit privateering and not piracy though. The ship called the Skipper had been sanctioned for moving Iranian oil, and a federal judge had approved a warrant for its seizure a few weeks ago. Joe Biden also seized a tanker, in 2023. But a big difference is that that one was actually full of Iranian oil. And this one is full of Venezuelan oil. So why does the US get to seize all the oil too? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Anyway, Pam Bondi posted video on X. The oil boat maybe went to Iran before, so this is just fine? And an unnamed official claimed to the New York Times that the vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered. If true, that is just like Russia has allegedly done at least 133 times that we know of to evade sanctions! But Trump would never dare. What has Trump ever gotten from NATO? Where is his Trump Tower Paris? Watch his baloney hole, if you can stand it: An interesting day, from the standpoint of news. “As you probably know, we have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually, and other things are happening.” Trumptannia rules the waves! He does not sound all there. And oh hey, are we ever going to get video of those bombing survivors getting murdered, like Trump said? What about these Asian oil brokers, does he plan to pay them anything for bogarting their delivery? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But Trump’s not taking the well-worn path America has usually taken to remove South American dictators! Coups and installing a puppet would be traditional, being much cheaper, faster and cleaner than murdering random innocent-until-proven-guilty people on tiny boats in international waters off of the coast (many who have turned out to not even be Venezuelan at all) in hopes that the dictator presidente will then step down out of sympathy, or something. But seems Trump doesn’t just want a new partner at the top, he wants a different sort of package entirely, details TBD. He seems particularly focused on the seas, in addition to the oil that will be a “field day” for American companies, obviously. Venezuela may not be a significant source of drugs to America, but being at the tippy-top of South America, it is one of the busiest waypoints for cocaine and heroin in the world, and is one of the busiest container ports for other goods, too, including oil. Money comes in, oil, opiates and heroin go out, that’s what running a port is all about! Why would Trump want a mere puppet, when he could occupy it all, and Venezuela will pay for it? Throw in collecting a toll at the Panama Canal, and Trump and friends like BlackRock could do grifts the likes of which the world has never seen, from most of the ship traffic in the hemisphere! But why won’t these unnamed White House sources specify what the plan is for after deposing Nicolás Maduro? A new election? Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 vote, returning from exile in Spain? Maybe Congress should try harder to find out. That vote on War Powers would be nice, too. Meanwhile, Americans are not fucking interested in whatever Trump’s got going on. In a CBS/YouGov poll a few weeks ago, only one in five had even heard that there was a military buildup in the first place. (These voters today, with their TikToks and their algorithms!) Once informed, two-thirds of Republicans said Trump needs to explain his actions. Independents were especially pissed, with 86 percent demanding an explanation. And 70 percent of all respondents opposed any kind of military action down there. What next in the old man’s all-to-real reality gameshow? Stay tuned, it’s sure to be full of more surprises!

Title: US jobless benefit applications jump to 236,000 last week as concerns about labor market persist

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750.

Title: Trump Administration Joins EU in Russian Frozen Asset Madness

Time Published: 2025-12-11T11:52:15Z
Full Content:
The level of derangement among far too many of our putative betters has reached such a fever pitch that mere narcissism and grandiosity seem inadequate as explanations. The latest example comes via the Wall Street Journal, in an exclusive account as to how the Trump Administration intends to avail itself of Russian central bank frozen assets, with the fig leaf that of course Russia would go along to curry favor with Trump and because investing in a busted up country is clearly a fabulous commercial opportunity. Let us not forget that the US tried a more adult version of this plan and got nowhere. It hired BlackRock as an adviser to flog a Ukraine reconstruction fund,1 back the days when the tale that Ukraine would win the war seems much more plausible, and got nowhere. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as €140 billion or more worth in Euroclear.2 Mind you, the Europeans, in the persons of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, and her allies in planned Russian asset heist like Emmanuel Macron, Kier Starmer, Frederich Merz, and Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in peril. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. But back to the more obviously bonkers Trump plan. The Journal account suggests that the Trump plan to use Russia frozen assets in a US managed “fund” for Ukraine reconstruction, which was part of leaked 28 points plan, has set off the frenzy in European capitals to grab them pronto, before the US and Russia can come to an agreement….as if that were at all likely. From U.S. Blueprint to Rewire Economies of Russia, Ukraine Sets Off Clash With Europe: The Trump administration in recent weeks has handed its European counterparts a series of documents, each a single page, laying out its vision for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the return of Russia to the global economy… The U.S. blueprint has been spelled out in appendices to current peace proposals that aren’t public but were described to The Wall Street Journal by U.S. and European officials. The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops. Let’s stop here. The Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant is not merely “currently occupied”. It is in one of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia and Russia, per its constitution, has made part of Russia. There is simply no way that the West is going to get use of it on anything other than arms-length commercial terms. Any discussion of power or reconstruction of Ukraine generally ignore the fact that no one other than Russia can execute it. Recall that Russia has already done considerable damage to not just Ukraine electricity transmission but increasing to generation as well. Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge. And of course there is the overriding highly optimistic assumption, that there will be an economically and politically independent Ukraine after the war. Ukraine and the EU are laboring mightily to make sure that does not happen. Their continued intransigence and belligerence have made the case to a highly risk-averse Putin that Russia will have to dictate outcomes on the battlefield. So the only question is how much Russia decides it has to add to Russia versus make into a rump Ukraine overseen by a friendly regime. Back to the Journal: Another appendix offers America’s broad-strokes vision for bringing Russia’s economy in from the cold, with U.S. companies investing in strategic sectors from rare-earth extraction to drilling for oil in the Arctic, and helping to restore Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the rest of the world. This is the worst sort of arrogant paternalism, as if Russia still needed the West. The quiet scandal in global economics: From 2008 to 2025, Russia’s real GDP per capita grew faster than Germany, the UK, and France despite sanctions, SWIFT bans, export controls, frozen assets and a full-scale geopolitical confrontation. pic.twitter.com/0C7ijjrCcc — . (@Lucid_Watcher) December 5, 2025 But not to worry, the Journal reassures us that Russia really is hurting: A new assessment by a Western intelligence agency, reviewed by the Journal, said that Russia has technically been in recession for six months and that the challenges of running its war economy while trying to control prices are presenting a systemic risk to its banking sector. One has to assume the Russian negotiators were also informed about this scheme (a version of this idea, but perhaps less detailed, was to be respectfully receptive when the US presented this asset, erm, usage plan, as opposed to bursting out laughing, or alternatively getting angry over being presumed to be total chumps. Returning to the Journal: Some European officials who have seen the documents said they weren’t sure whether to take some of the U.S. proposals seriously. One official compared them to President Trump’s vision of building a Riviera-style development in Gaza. Another, referring to the proposed U.S.-Russia energy deals, said it was an economic version of the 1945 conference where World War II victors divvied up Europe. “It’s like Yalta,” he said. Readers are encouraged to opine, but given the early similarly high-handed-while-also-barmy Ukraine “raw earths” scheme that the US browbeat Ukraine into accepting after some negotiation, yours truly thinks this is part of Team Trump following the Red Queen practice of working to believe impossible things. Such as: U.S. officials involved in the negotiations say Europe’s approach would quickly deplete the frozen funds. Washington, on the other hand, would tap Wall Street executives and private-equity billionaires to invest the money and expand the amount available to invest. One official involved in the talks said the pot could grow to $800 billion under American management. “Our sensibility is that we really understand financial growth,” the official said. Now to the European part. Ursula von der Leyen is attempting to ram through legislation that would allow the Commission to seize the frozen assets in Euroclear pursuant to emergency powers. Belgium has objected vociferously since it would be on the hook if Euroclear were sued successfully. The ECB has refused to provide a backstop: I asked ECB President Lagarde about the potential impact on financial stability of using Russian frozen assets held at Euroclear (140 billion). The ECB has (rightly) indicated that a guarantee would be a breach of the Treaty. Other options urgently needed for Ukraine👇 @wbeke pic.twitter.com/ih9j89n5GV — Dirk Gotink (@DirkGotink) December 3, 2025 Since Euroclear has also said in no uncertain terms that it thinks the asset heist, prettied up as trying to use the assets as collateral for loans, is illegal, I am not sure how it can be compelled to turn over the funds, given the general rule of “possession is 9/10 of the law” and the near-certainty that Euroclear and Belgium would seek an injunction too. ❗️Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever called the European Commission's proposal to use frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a reparations loan “theft,” reports VRT NWS. “There are certainly better solutions than stealing the Russian central bank’s money. This is a… pic.twitter.com/KJR0mQWD5D — 🪖MilitaryNewsUA🇺🇦 (@front_ukrainian) December 10, 2025 Aside from Russia suing Euroclear in a non-EU court where Euroclear operates (readers can opine, but I see Singapore courts provide for discovery), Russia can also take matters into its own hands: One of the unintended consequences of the EU's batshit crazy plan of ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ appropriating and repurposing Russia's frozen assets is the fact that Euroclear, a body responsible for processing equities, bonds, derivatives, and investment fund transfers, still holds… pic.twitter.com/6RHLDTpjEk — Nina 🐙 Byzantina (@NinaByzantina) December 10, 2025 But weirdly (or perhaps following its friends at the Commission) the Financial Times in a story yesterday tried to make Hungary’s Viktor Orban, regularly demonized for being too friendly with Russia, into the bad guy. From a Wednesday story: EU countries are to fast-track a decision to indefinitely immobilise up to €210bn in Russian sovereign assets, in an attempt to bypass Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán even before Europe’s leaders meet for a summit next week. The hurried effort to pass the legislation — which invokes emergency powers to override national vetoes on the extension of sanctions — aims to protect Brussels’ leverage in US-led peace talks over the war in Ukraine, according to officials familiar with the plans. Diplomats handling the legislation see advantage in moving swiftly in coming days to detach the contentious question of immobilising assets from the debate on raising loans for Kyiv backed by the frozen Russian funds. That funding question will be left to EU leaders next week. The move to vote within the coming week, overriding the principle of unanimity on sanctions decisions, risks enraging Hungary and other countries that oppose the measure. Past instances of EU countries outvoting other member states on critical issues — such as Poland and Hungary on migration policy — have caused bad blood between capitals for years. The European Commission last week proposed using €210bn of Russia’s foreign assets immobilised under sanctions in the EU to fund a loan to Kyiv, initially for €90bn that would be disbursed in the next two years. For the loan scheme to work, the underlying assets need to be immobilised indefinitely, rather than for six-month periods that can only be renewed with unanimous agreement of all EU27 countries… To bypass the risk of the sanctions being lifted, the commission has proposed using emergency powers reserved for dealing with economic crises to indefinitely impose the sanctions on the assets. Enacted under Article 122 of the EU’s treaties, it can be passed with just a majority of EU countries, circumventing potential vetoes. Mind you, there is no crisis. There will be a tsunami of litigation if the Commission and its allies manage to get this scheme implemented. And there would be a crisis due to their malfeasance if the plaintiffs were to prevail. So the plan is use emergency powers to contend with the emergency knowingly produced by entirely voluntary action decried by those best in the know (Euroclear) as illegal. Alexander Mercouris covered the circularity of this argument in his video on Wednesday, and earlier argued that the loud and clear objections by Euroclear and the Belgian government would be powerful ammo in litigation over any seizure attempt. As an aside, one has to think that a and perhaps the reason that Ursula von der Leyen has pursued this scheme so manically is that it is far and away her best opportunity to greatly expand the Commission’s powers. She’s been on a massive land grab ever since she took office. This morning’s Politico European newsletter seemed less bullish than the prior day pink paper account, and also corrected the barmy idea that Orban was the big baddie: GROUNDHOG DAY ENVOYS DISCUSS ASSETS SUPERFREEZE: EU ambassadors will today weigh up whether to hand the Commission emergency powers to keep Russia’s state assets frozen indefinitely. Envoys will examine updated legal texts after Wednesday’s inconclusive discussion, three EU diplomats told POLITICO’s Gregorio Sorgi. What’s that: The mechanism is a cornerstone of the Commission’s plan to mobilize €210 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine — most of which are held by the Belgian-based Euroclear. It would overhaul the current system that compels EU countries to unanimously reauthorize the sanctions every six months. That means Kremlin-friendly countries such as Hungary and Slovakia would lose the power to release the sanctioned money with a simple no vote, leaving EU capitals on the hook to repay the loan to Russia. The light at the end of the tunnel: The diplomats said late Wednesday that the proposal could be “stripped down” in a bid to win Belgium’s support and adopt the plan by the end of the week. Hopefully. Yes, it’s still all about Belgium: PM Bart De Wever is holding out over concerns that Belgium could be financially exposed if the money needs to be repaid and has now asked for more safety nets. In an interview with VRT NWS Wednesday, De Wever even refused to rule out legal action if the EU moves ahead with seizing the assets… More stick than carrot: Europe’s strategy to sway Belgium may be to warn the kingdom that it could be treated like Hungary if it doesn’t come on board — with its diplomats, ministers and officials losing their voice around the EU table, reports Zoya Sheftalovich. The Politico entry contains this amusing section: . “No jurisdiction”: A legal memo circulated among diplomats Wednesday by law firm Covington & Burling rejects Belgium’s argument that it would face major legal retaliation from Russia. The four-page document says the risk of litigation is “minimal,” insisting Russia wouldn’t be able to challenge an EU reparations loan in the International Criminal Court or “any comparable international adjudicative body.” Legally-sophisticated readers know that if you look long enough, you can find a lawyer who will bless pretty much anything.3 And I don’t think of Covington as premier firm in financial or international litigation. I would have thought one of the top New York “white shoe” or London firms would be the go-tos on this topic. A ranking by Chambers of US firms alone for Disputes (International & Cross-Border) | Global of US firms confirms this notion, putting Covington well down on the list. I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views. Even though von der Leyen and her fellow conspirators are laboring mightily to get her long-sought “seize not freeze” scheme across the line, note the Politico signposting: Groundhog Day. They are of the view this will be another episode of motion playing at progress. But even then, simply keeping the matter in play bolsters Zelensky domestically, as in continuing to keep alive the fantasy that there will be more money and weapons for Ukraine. European leaders are as committed as every to fighting to the last Ukrainian. _____ 1 BlackRock never committed to invest in this scheme, contrary to some claims. 2 The total amount reported has varied, in part because the EU has been stealing the interest, and some accounts may include the assets of sanctioned Russian entities and individuals along with the central bank holdings. The Financial Times on Wednesday reported that Euroclear held €185 billion of Russian frozen assets. 3 For instance, recall Linklaters blessing Lehman’s use of Repo 105 to engage in accounting fraud, which pretty much every legally responsible adult derided when it became public. Just a little quibble: “Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge.” Crazy but true: I happen to know for a fact that ABB (a company headquartered in Switzerland but production mostly in the EU) delivers huge amounts of electrical equipment to Russia. Supposedly the delivery is to Hungary or Switzerland. As an insider joke workers in Germany put a “Z” on deliveries to Russia. Mind you: industrial workers in Germany vote 50% for AFD. With a little modification anything produced for the European grid will also work in Russia. What do you mean by “electrical equipment”? That covers a multitude of sins. I have been told the reverse as far as the transformers are concerned. Ukraine was having to scavenge former Warsaw Pact states for replacements early in the electricity war. They would presumably not have needed to do so if they could be manufactured readily by friendlies. Apparently most utilities do have a lot of spares, they are pretty long-lived, so it may be only with the increased intensification of the grid attacks that Ukraine is now short on/out of gear. There are no transformers on the market. Not for Ukraine and not for anybody. Delivery times are in years. The reason being the expansion of the grid caused by renewables. ABB is delivering all kinds of electrical fuses. Which shows the Russian market is humming. Lot’s of building as a few hundred thousand soldiers from formerly depressed areas are getting huge payments for serving in Ukraine. When you look at Russia war you should look at Russia casualty rate. That will say how long Russia can continue this war until Russia people start feel pain. We also have to count how long can people afford 16% interested rate. I still don’t get how that central bank can still keep her job. Russia have lost about 100k soldiers and same amount of injured. All this spell Russia will accept USA peace deal but the only stopping it is Ukraine. Putin was wrong in his calculation that he would get a good deal from USA by dragging this war slowly Russia regards this war as existential. So your metrics do not apply. Look as WWII for how much pain Russia can take, This conflict is not in the same universe. I doubt that Russia could take as much pain as in WWII. Already 20 years ago every conscript was given a SIM card so he could phone home to mom once a week. Inconceivable in Stalin times. But Russia doesn´t have to take such pain. The “kontraktniki” are paid handsomely. There are no conscripts at the front. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Russia is closer to us than we think. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. This is based on purposeful reading of the statistics, by comparing the percentage of kontraktniki of the eligible population of the region. In the reality, Moscow and St. Petersburg regions provide the bulk of the contract soldiers – as in several hundred thousand, just because they are so huge population centers. Especially after the liberation of the Kursk oblast the St. Petersburg region has constantly exceeded it’s recruitment quota. Also, at least a year or two ago, several Duma members, governors, mayors and other members of regional administration volunteered for the SMO. Mostly those with military experience, but anyway. You’re right this war is existential for Russia, and I think a lot of Russian people have come to that conclusion, including the young soldiers fighting on the front lines. But is the war being fought as if it were existential for Russia? In my view, no. Two strategies come to mind one where Putin forces the Russian population to accept a Minsk style peace deal, or another where Putin believes the West will eventually come to the negotiating table to agree on a new security arrangement. A new security deal won’t happen but Russia might be able to secure a Minsk 3 agreement with the USA However, the EU and the UK would never allow that to happen. This war will likely drag on until the Democrats return to power in the USA There’s no way the Republicans will hold onto the House or the Senate. So now you have an EU implementing austerity on steroids just so it can keep sending billions to Ukraine, and the USA doing the same. Scott Ritter said just a few days ago that Ukraine will collapse soon and its people will freeze but none of that really matters, because for Russia to capitalize on such a collapse, it would need the troops to actually take Ukraine. And right now, Russia doesn’t have those troops. Nor will the Ukrainian population rise up in support. Instead, everyone will either wait their turn to be sent to the front or try to escape the country. I just think people are struggling to accept what’s coming because it’s so unprecedented. I hope you’re right but sadly, I fear we’re heading toward a very dark place in this world. I may be wrong, but I think this is the consequence of the lesser evil strategy finally coming home to roost. These politicians in the west they have no morals. So US sued for peace after Antietam, I guess? All this spell … … differently in Cyrillic. They even have a word meaning non-agreement-capable*. * See for example https://www.moonofalabama.org/2022/06/how-russia-can-and-will-de-nato-size-europe.html The retaliatory response of Russia confiscating European assets would be an adequate deterrent to the theft of Russian funds if the EU leaders were sane, but that is a big if. If I were Belgium (things you never thought you’d write!), I would seize the Russian assets *and* European Commission assets to the same value as collateral for the indemnity *and* the Euroclear and SWIFT servers and IT personnel for long enough to place them under Belgian control. When the rules are broken, the rules are broken and all that counts is leverage. Remember poor Greece and its attempt to leave the Euro Hotel California? No leverage. But controlling Euroclear would give Belgium the next best leverage to controlling Target 2…. Since an ongoing fantasy about Russia is to crash Putin’s credibility in his home country, via tempting Putin to go along with US/European schemes, Trump’s home peanut gallery wants to pretend that Ukraine is close to victory… a song that is sung by the media (and arms merchants) that have played along for so long. After all, having pushed Ukraine into suicidal choices, don’t “we” the West owe Ukraine and ourselves some dignity amidst the rubble? Well, The Financial Times is not alone on demonizing Orban (no matter if he is good or bad I am not opining on this) put he is the preferred excuse for many to stay silent when in reality they do not align with the General Stupidity now in charge. Today I found an article written by a retired Spanish councelor for the EU titled “Europe and The Accounting Miracle of The Century: The “Reparation Loan” and Other Legal Fictions” (in Spanish) which explains the (false) equilibriums that the EU pursues to seize the Russian assets while at the same time claiming they are not touching them and at the same time assuming fiscal obligations for EU countries which are out of EU’s reach and treaties. This is all incredible stupid and there are many more governments (more than Just Orban’s) which are absolutely not wanting to become indebted for this unlimited support to Zelenski. I would mention the Spanish government even if they do not say it when being forced to reduce debt and at the same time being wanted to increase debt… because Zelenski. If somehow the EU Commission manages to force their financial games I anticipate this as the beginning of the end of the EU. I guess we will know by the 18th of December. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as 140 billion euros worth in Euroclear. The timing coming so soon after the Belgians took fright at the seizure means this is probably an effort to cajole them with a US blessing. Now the real question is: Is the EU/UK trying to bribe Trump to support the asset seizure, or in reality was the asset seizure a US lead directive all along? Sorry, this is an incorrect reading. 1. The US wants Russia to contribute Russian assets, not steal them, so there would be no risk to Brussels if Russia goes along. 2. The EU is opposed to this scheme. This is off point utterly to what the EU intends. It wants the money to be used to continue the war. Does anyone have figures for the Russian assets owned by US, European and other investors at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Many of which are now likewise frozen, and written down, but have great underlying value if not endangered by the proposed theft? The lack of discussion ofwhat is at stake for western investors (including pensioners & other indirect holders) seems extraordinary. I hate sounding harsh, but you are awfully late to that party. And you seem to be suggesting that was Russia that could or did take hostile action, when Russia bent over backwards in the early years of the SMO not to abrogate agreements with the West. For instance, Russia kept supplying the EU with gas until the EU made it a point of pride to go without. It was the US, EU and UK investors that imposed shock and awe sanctions in February 2022. Western owners of Russian securities and ETFs at the time were very shortly barred from trading. Their balances were written down to zero at US brokerage firms. Now there has been wrangling about recovery. For instance, the BlackRock Russia ETF is trying to complete its liquidation by year end. It last traded at $8.06 but I cannot tell quickly how much investors recovered: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239677/ishares-msci-russia-capped-etf#/ As a holder of Gazprom, Sberbank and Polyus, not only frozen and effectively zero, but getting none of the dividends as well. There was a point I believe, where sale at a huge discount was possible to a too big to fail bank that was allowed to keep access to the Moscow exchange. What Covington does a heck of lot of in Brussels is lobbying, esp. on behalf of tech giants. To my eyes, that’s what’s behind the stupid memo. Mutual hand-washing. Aha! Thanks! …Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in jeopardy. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. And Italy’s share of the estimated 185 billion euro at Euroclear would come to some 25 billion euro. YS: I add a couple-a edits, with your indulgence. First, I’ll add the polite word “jeopardy” instead of “pasticciaccio,” that is, omnishambles. Second, I’m reading here in Italy the figure of 185 billions euros parked at Euroclear, too, which may come from Financial Times (or another source). What is this current bout of tripping over one’s wee-wee to wreck things stemming from? As Yves Smith has consistently pointed out, as well as the other writers at Naked Capitalism, what we are now witnessing is elites running helter-skelter to try to cover up their complicity and criminality in the proxy war in Ukraine (one million dead Ukrainians, mainly men sent to the slaughter) and the genocide in Palestine (minimum acceptable estimate, in my not so humble opinion, is 400 000 slaughtered in the West Bank and Gaza). Here in Italy, the formidable philosopher Donatella di Cesare and ex-ambassador Elena Basile have been elaborating the same line of thinking. So we have a case of convergent evolution (take that, anti-Darwinists): Trump and von der Leyen are acting pretty much alike. The law is for the little people. Their carefully defined constitutional roles don’t matter anymore — what matters is our chance to witness their lust for power. Hmmm. I wonder if Dr. Guillotine’s marvelous invention can be trundled out for a double salami slicing. Or am I overestimating the severity of the symptom? (To which I will add in my argument for failed elites avoiding consequences Hillary Clinton’s recent spewings, Marco Rubio and resentments, the timeless Kaja Kallas, Pete Hegseth, Mark Rutte, and the thoroughly egregious Friedrich Merz.) PS: I am no fan of Vladimir Putin, but the line chart of GDP growth explains much. Not to be overlooked. Is Covington & Burling a premier firm in international litigation? And does their listing as a Band Four national firm on the Chambers list support that they are not? I don’t know who at Covington wrote the memo referenced above and I haven’t read the memo. That being said I worked at Covington as a litigator and at one of the higher ranked firms listed on the Chambers ranking for international litigation. I’ve also advised law firms about how to be recognized by Chambers, both as law firms and as individual attorneys (which Chambers also ranks). My overwhelming experience is that any firm mentioned by Chambers and many law firms not recognized by Chambers do very careful work, especially when litigation departments send memos about the law to clients. Covington has been around since 1919. If their lawyers write a memo that they think the risk of litigation is low because of lack of jurisdiction, there is a very high probability that there is at least a colorable argument supporting that conclusion. That doesn’t mean the conclusion in the memo will prove correct, but it is unlikely to be just made up to tell a client what it wants to hear. And there is no difference between a Band One firm and a Band Four firm in Chambers in this regard. Chambers has its quirks, but it’s people interview law firm clients as the basis of creating their rankings. If you are a band four firm nationally in a given practice area, that means you are in the top 10 to 15 firms in the whole country. That is a signal to in-house lawyers at large corporate law departments that you are very good in that practice area. Again I don’t know specifics about this particular memo, but it’s a stretch to conclude that a law firm just manufactured a legal opinion desired by a client because of its Chambers ranking. Band 4 out of 5 is low, not high, relative to the other big firms. It means they are in the running as a reasonable choice and might be good on a horses-for-course basis All the firms in the higher bands are above them. And the ranking was for what amounted to their international practice compared to other big US firms, not international litigation and not international financial service. As indicated there are very strong UK firms in international legal works, such as Freshfields in arbitration And I have been a Covington client, as in I retained them when I was head of M&A at Sumitomo. They are not all that strong in litigation. There are specialist firms (and not small ones, BTW) that are the killers in that field. You asked for the commentariat to provide perspective on your comment about Covington’s litigation prowess. So, I did. I understand that, based on your experience as a client of the firm, you weren’t that impressed. Suffice it so say that some folks have reached a different conclusion. Their litigation department has been recognized many times as an elite department. See, e.g.: https://www.cov.com/en/about/firm-honors None of this speaks directly to the specific memo that was referenced in the post above. I asked for reader experience. You did not indicate you had any as a client and instead tried to argue from the same link I provided. You did not even bother finding other sources that could perhaps be more germane. You are not in a position to judge Covington on any sort of comparative performance basis as an ex-employee. Chambers is limited, as I indicated, by covering only US law firms. My gut is London being a much more international finance center (and also having until recently been in the Union) would be more likely to have the best counsel for this sort of matter. I did not say I was not impressed. I was a client of Gene Ludwig, who I imagine you have heard of. I went to Covington rather than a NYC firm because I knew a Japanese bank would be way down the food chain for a white shoe NYC firm while Covington would (and did) value having Sumitomo as a client more than they would have. So I got a good seasoned M&A partner while with a NYC firm, I would be at risk of being fobbed largely off on a 5 year associate. I knew generally that what I needed ought to be within their capabilities. And they did a fine job on my particular matter. Being good in one area (negotiating a fairly simple but cross border M&A deal) does not extend to other areas. They ran up a huge and unwarranted bill on some international tax structuring, basically reinventing the wheel. The awards list you linked to prove my point, not yours. The awards were nearly all onesies, from years back and very narrow sub-fields of litigation. I have also had the privilege of sometimes working with top M&A and securities lawyers (the top M&A counsel at Cleary and Cravath, Rodgin Cohen at S&C before he became managing partner, for instance) and so know what a very top tier counsel looks like. And so I have also been lucky enough to occasionally find less illustrious representation that was excellent, such as a biomedical engineer who first worked at the NIH and drafted the first US intellectual property agreement. 80% of her language is still in use. Later general counsel at a public company, so both 3/4 of the way to being a securities lawyer as well as an IP lawyer. Drafting a bit rough but effective, and a fantastic negotiator. No you did not ask for reader experience with Covington, you asked “I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views.” Well EnigmaWrappedInBacon piped up with their views. You may not agree with them but they did specifically what you asked and you jumped down their throat. Not to doubt your comment or Covington’s expertise, but Covington has represented Ukraine and Ukrainian companies in disputes with Russia. I assume they wrote the memo for Ukraine that wants reparations, not for Everclear or European companies or banks that might be on the hook if Covington’s opinion is wrong. No, please re-read the Politico quote. It was very clearly about the Euroclear fracas, see the reference to the ICC, which would never come up in a commercial dispute. In keeping, it also referenced the Russian state retaliating, not corporate entities. But that is another useful tidbit on Covington. Putting aside the fact that this whole scheme doesn’t make much sense, I could see a reason for Russia to go along with it (or at least not oppose it publicly). They’ve already likely written off those assets and if this works out to be a “free” card to play to deal with Trump, why not. It would also create even more conflict between the US and the EU because they both want the assets for their own goals. Alexander Mercouris has said the reverse, that informed contacts have told him it would suit Russia for the West to seize the assets because they could very legitimately make a monster stink, which would create more sympathy in the Global South. Recall that one big reason Russia has had to go slowly in the war is not just its practice of attrition (that is the big driver) but also that its economic allies are not happy with Russia gobbling up Ukraine, no matter how legitimate the reasons, and would prefer a negotiated settlement. The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. Tweets in May (with links to sites in Asia) said Russia was contemplating suing Euroclear in Hong Kong. See also: Euroclear has refused to comply with any plan to hand over frozen Russian assets for use by the EU. The company maintains that such a move would amount to confiscation, with major legal and financial risks, and insists it doesn’t have a procedure for it. https://t.co/myGzF8ZyNx — Nynke Feenstra (@DutchMindset) December 9, 2025 The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. The Western countries have been doing a bang-up job making this case themselves throughout their entire histories! Everyone from native Americans in the 1600s forward can help testify to this case if it’s needed. Ultimately, I don’t know because I don’t know what Russian officials are thinking. It’s just that using those assets to damage relations between the EU and the US could be a viable option. We’ve seen public statements threatening legal action (or worse) over EU confiscation, but nothing (yet?) about the US “proposal”. Maybe they just don’t take it seriously or maybe it suits Russia just fine to have the US and EU fighting over that money. Personally I have lost track of the number of loans that have been taken out using the interest of those frozen Russian assets as collateral. It was like every month a new loan like this was being made. So of course the Europeans will not allow those assets to be swiped by the Americans – nor will the Russians. About half would be used in repairing the damage in the Ukraine and a red line for Russia is “reparations.” The Russians will have to spend huge amounts of money to rebuild the Donbass alone. And if Donny thinks that the Russians will hand over one of their major power plants, well, America is more likely to hand over one of theirs to the Russians. I think that Jared Kushner had a big role to play in that so called peace plan as it tries to make sure that America in the end wins this conflict while making huge pots of money. for Trump and his team, it is always about making money and nothing else exists. Politico yesterday had the following explication: According to the document, the extra cash buffer [for Belgium] should be financed by the windfall profits that Euroclear collects in interest from a deposit account at the European Central Bank, where the Kremlin-sanctioned money is currently sitting. The proceeds amounted to €4 billion last year. The bulk of this revenue is currently being funneled to Ukraine to pay down a €45 billion loan from G7 countries, with Euroclear retaining a 10 percent buffer to cover legal risks. In order to better protect Euroclear, Belgium wants to raise this threshold over the coming years. So if Politico’s read of it is right, there is no “loan” backed by the interest on Russian assets. Rather, the interest is taken directly (legal mavens may chime in on whether this constitutes theft) to pay for some other extant obligation. To G7, so the Americans are getting some of that money too… That whole last paragraph is utterly fascinating. Starting with the fact that Euroclear is already building up a contingency reserve for “legal risks”, which is kind of telling in and of itself. Parenthetically. I know everyone’s been focused on the possibility of a lawsuit against Euroclear. I seem to recall the Russian government, possibly in the form of Lavrov, dropping an off-hand comment recently that European private companies still have several hundred billion euros worth of assets inside Russia. Meaning, a reciprocal action could be the seizure of these assets (I assume a majority of these are equity stakes in joint ventures or Russian subsidiaries). Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public. Do they simply not want to admit that these assets still exist? Do they hope and pray that the Russians would exercise leniency and go after Belgium and Euroclear instead (which they very well might)? Is this simply yet another completely, utterly unexpected and thoroughly surprising move that no-one ever expects the Russians to make? Who knows… “Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public.” This is a continuation of an attitude that the European business community adopted almost a decade ago. It was silent on the question of Brexit — despite all the evidence that the way the British government was mishandling matters would have devastating consequences (practical, commercial, financial). It was silent when the EU forced the renunciation of Russian energy imports (oil, gas, coal), and silent when Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged — despite knowing very well the devastating consequences all this would entail regarding energy prices and the availability of raw materials for industrial processes. There was the supine way the EU reacted to the tariffs imposed by Trump, and no big outcry from the business community — if there was one, I do not remember it to be followed by concerted actions to put pressure on the EU Commission and on the European governments. Now it is again silent while the EU considers measures that will entail not only dire losses regarding investments in Russia, but also the ruin of Europe as an international financial centre (plus a possible collapse of the €). My opinion has always been that large, internationally active firms do not care — they will just relocate their activities somewhere else if conditions become unbearable; they do not have any loyalty to Europe anyway — while SMEs lack influence — they are too small to lobby successfully when governments only take big players seriously. But this is now going a bit far. No matter what foolishly destructive measures the politicos envision, industrial, commercial, and financial circles never put their foot down; it is getting very disconcerting. What I’m wondering is that in 2022 it was reported that most of those Russian assets were debt securities (likely Eurobonds), so basically IOUs by EU, not actual money. How much has this changed in a few years, I can’t seem to find out. Anyway, to me it seems that Eurozone countries not honoring their debts would cause even more economic havoc than just breaking the Euroclear and the kingdom of Belgium or the Russian countermeasures. High quality bonds are financial assets and easily monetized. I don’t understand your point. In general, large balances are put into securities. A bank deposit is a liability of the bank and is also not money. It’s guaranteed only up to very low limits. Depositaries like Euroclear and the US DTC (Depositary Trust Company) are full of securities, not cash balances. My point is that if we’re talking about debt owed to Russia by, say, EU Commission and some Eurozone countries, and they now go and decide they will just resell this debt and take the money, it’s not just theft of Russian assets, but also defaulting on the “original” debt. I really, really don’t know how this works (thus the word “wondering” in the original post), but if this is as I understood, would there really be market for bonds under such a serious legal predicament? And given the risk, I’d assume they’d have to be (re)sold with a significant undervaluation. No, Eurobonds are not “debt owed to Russia”. They are bonds that Russia bought. The EU Commission does not issue bonds. Nor does Europe. Eurobonds are issued both by companies, banks, and states. They are legal obligations to pay interest and principal irrespective of who owns them at the time. That is why seizing them from Euroclear = stealing. EU Commission indeed issues bonds. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaties to borrow from the international capital markets on behalf of the European Union. It is a well-established name in debt securities markets, with a strong track record of successful bond issuances over the past 40 years. All EU-Bond issuances executed by the European Commission are denominated exclusively in euro. The estimated value of the outstanding bonds is €1 trillion for the Commission alone. Another trillion of outstanding bonds has been issued by other EU institutions, according to CEPR. I expect that RU has long ago written off those frozen central bank assets (which is not to say that RU won’t litigate ferociously to get them back…..even if RU loses in court, the bad publicity surrounding the litigation might cause irreparable damage to the EU). Seizing and spending the stolen assets (assuming weapons and the trained UKR manpower to use them are readily available, which I very much doubt) will only serve to prolong the conflict for a few more months. The real issue here is the potential long-term consequence to the EU if Ursula succeeds in grabbing (and spending) RU’s money. I think the reputational damage will be enormous. Of course Ursula (et al) will be long gone by the time the legal chickens come home to roost (the wheels of justice grind slowly), so she likely doesn’t care. This does not bode well, methinks. No, see the comment above re what Mercouris’ sources say. Russia has every incentive to litigate for geopolitical reasons. Look at how (in a very different sort of case) the US tried to prosecute Internet Research Agency, the bot farm part or totally owed by Prigozhin, that famously won the 2016 election for Trump with $200,000 of Facebook ads…half of which appeared after election day and 25% of which were viewed by no one. The DoJ filed criminal charges v. the IRA to advance its Russiagate narrative (I forget whether v. individuals or the company). They showed up to defend the case. The DoJ immediately dropped it. So as the Covington memo suggests, methinks the Eurocrats are similarly over-relying on the idea that the Russian government or individuals won’t act. Oh, of course RU will litigate; perhaps I wasn’t clear enough. My point was that they will do so not in any expectation of getting their assets back, but simply for the fun of it (knowing that the awful publicity will torch the EU’s reputation and cause dissension both inside the EU, and between the EU and the USA). Shredding western unity (and possibly shattering the EU itself) is arguably worth more to RU than 200bn clams (or whatever the exact amount is), and in any case RU will offset much of this 200bn loss by seizing EU assets inside RU. has anyone in he west calculated the value of western assets in Russia that could be seized in retaliation for this bizarre scheme? it can’t be a small number. “The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops.” As if, after all of this, the first thing on the minds of the people remaining in Ukraine is some damn data center. Putin signed a decree in 2024 that allows Russians to claim US assets in Russia, if Russian assets were seized by any member of the G7. Some online estimates (no link) have been as high as $1 Trillion. Aha, good intel! But not European? I believe the decree in question obligated the government to prepare legislation to allow Russian subjects who’s property or assets have been confiscated by a G7 country to go to a Russian court to receive compensation from similar property or assets of the said country’s subjects holding within Russian jurisdiction. Sort of a counter to the REPO act, but covering all G7 countries and over $80 worth invested in Russia by them. And right on cue, the Central Bank of Russia today announced it is suing Euroclear in the Moscow Court of Arbitration for recovery of losses caused by action of Euroclear.

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast. In the Podcast, we break down the biggest news in AI each week and issue AI recommendations for our $500,000 AI Portfolio. One of our better recommendations: buying shares of Broadcom on October 11, 2024, and buying more on December 6, 2024. Those two recommendations are up 125% and 127%. Other great recommendations we’ve made include Credo (up 455%), Lumentum (339%), Ciena (243%), and SK Hynix (up 163%). We’ve embedded our latest episode below. Subscribing is absolutely free. If you’re looking for a trusted source for discovering new AI stock ideas – and getting updates on stocks like Broadcom – look no further than the AI Investor Podcast. Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Broadcom Shares Down 3% Thursday After Oracle's Earnings Disappoint

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET.

If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39.

Title: Ukraine Talks Cover Peace Plan, Security Guarantees, Economic Recovery - Reports

Sputnik News 20251210 MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Negotiations on the Ukraine settlement revolve around discussions on three documents, namely a US-proposed peace plan, a security guarantees agreement, and an economic recovery plan for the post-conflict period, The Washington Post newspaper reported, citing US and Ukrainian officials. The talks remain far from concluded, the report said on Tuesday. Ukraine and its European allies plan to present further revisions to the plan on Wednesday, it added. Additionally, US officials are in discussions with Larry Fink, CEO of financial giant BlackRock, about reviving the company's proposal for a Ukrainian reconstruction fund that could raise $400 billion, The Washington Post reported. The World Bank may also be involved, the report said. Since mid-November, the US has been promoting a new peace proposal for Ukraine. On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin received US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in the Kremlin. The US representatives' visit to Russia was related to the discussion of the US peace plan for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said later that he was disappointed that Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not read the peace proposal for the Ukraine conflict. On Tuesday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Witkoff and Kushner gave Zelenskyy "days" to come up with a response to the peace plan. Zelenskyy reportedly told his European allies that Witkoff and Kushner pressured him during a two-hour phone call on Saturday to respond to the plan that demands Kiev accept territorial losses in exchange for US security guarantees, with Trump aiming to finalize the deal "by Christmas."

Title: Ukraine Considers Legal Path To Elections Under Martial Law As US Pushes For Vote
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/12/ukraine-251211-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2025-12-11T10:11:34Z
Full Content:
By RFE/RL December 11, 2025 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he held a "substantive discussion" with members of Ukraine's parliament on the possibility of holding an election, amid pressure from the United States to hold a vote despite wartime legal restrictions. Addressing Ukrainians in a nightly video on December 10, Zelenskyy said strong security guarantees from Kyiv's allies -- especially Washington -- are needed to hold a vote. "If partners, including our key partner in Washington, speak so much and so specifically about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legal Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt," he said, responding to a suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Kyiv was using the war as an excuse to avoid elections. "It is not easy, but pressure on this issue is definitely not what we need...Security challenges depend on partners, primarily America. Political and legal challenges must be answered by Ukraine. And they will be," he added. The White House has been pushing for Ukraine to hold elections -- US President Donald Trump told Politico in an interview published on December 9 that "it's time"-- even though Ukraine's constitution doesn't allow for elections during wartime. In a shift from previous statements, Zelenskyy told reporters on December 9 that he would push parliament to draft legislation allowing for elections during martial law. A vote could follow in 60 to 90 days once there are security guarantees in place to make sure voting would be safe for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy's comments come amid intense negotiations aimed at ending Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Ukrainian officials have been pushing back on a US-drafted peace plan that was seen as heavily favoring Russia. The possibility of holding elections has been regularly dismissed, with officials saying it would be impossible given daily Russian air strikes across the country, thousands of soldiers battling on the front lines, and millions of Ukrainians displaced. Opinion polls show most Ukrainians are against holding wartime elections, though with the last elections held in 2019 some want changes in the government to bring in fresh ideas. Widely popular, Zelenskyy's support has slipped in recent weeks amid a major corruption scandal that led to the resignation of an influential adviser, Andriy Yermak. On the battlefield and in negotiations, Russian officials believe they have the upper hand, and the 28-point plan proposed by the United States echoes most of the hard-line positions that Moscow has held since before the invasion. Ukraine's European allies, meanwhile, have been unenthusiastic about Washington's proposal. Before a planned meeting between the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- which includes Germany, France, Britain -- with Zelenskyy on December 11, leaders from the three countries held a phone call with Trump. Trump said said he exchanged "pretty strong words" with the leaders of France, Britain and Germany over Ukraine, another sign of a widening rift on how to end the war as it nears its fourth anniversary. "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added, noting the European countries talked about meeting this weekend in Europe. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Ukraine had agreed on key points of a possible reconstruction plan in discussions with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior officials, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," Zelenskyy said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskyy wrote earlier that he and and his European partners will soon present the United States with "refined documents" on the peace plan as well. There have been several major sticking points in the back-and-forth negotiations including the size of Ukraine's armed forces, Western security guarantees, and Russia's insistence that Ukraine be permanently barred from seeking NATO membership. The White House peace proposal, and the belief that it heavily favors Russian interests, has drawn criticism from some Republican lawmakers in Congress. President Vladimir Putin "is mocking President Trump and buying time to keep killing Ukrainian families," Representative Joe Wilson said.

Title: Micron Stock Has Gained More Than 200% This Year. Why Experts See Additional Record Highs on the Horizon.

One of the hottest AI stocks appears to have more room to run. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) have surged to all-time highs this week as analysts continue to raise their targets for the memory chip maker ahead of next week's earnings report. Citi analysts on Wednesday lifted their price target to $300 from $275, now double where their target for the stock was in early September. The analysts said the increasing demand for the advanced memory chips used to run artificial intelligence models should help bring in "large capital infusions" that help Micron and other memory chip makers boost their manufacturing capabilities to meet demand. Micron shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to a record closing high of just below $264. The stock price has more than tripled since the start of the year. Micron supplies memory components to other manufacturers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), making Micron one of many beneficiaries of the AI trade. Micron is the top performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year, and only four stocks in the S&P 500 have posted bigger gains in 2025. Artificial intelligence companies are looking to buy the chips as fast as they can be made, leading to a shortage of memory chips that Citi analysts say is causing "unprecedented increases" in pricing, which should further boost Micron's sales and profits. Deutsche Bank analysts on Tuesday hiked their own price target to $280 from $200, calling Micron "well poised to benefit" from changes in the memory-chip market. The analysts also called Micron "particularly attractive among the memory names given its unique ability to prioritize profitability over market share in this environment." Morgan Stanley analysts raised their own price target for Micron last month to $325 from $220 after upgrading the stock in October, calling the memory chip maker a "top pick" because of how that dramatic increase in pricing for memory products could boost sales and profits in the next year, even if prices start to normalize. Analysts are largely bullish on Micron stock, but its average price target suggest that some analysts think the chip maker's stock has hit its ceiling, or are waiting until after next week's report to adjust their view. The 11 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha are split between nine "buy" and two "hold" ratings, with the average price target among those analysts at around $237.

Title: Why retro, innovative indies and Nintendo ruled game design in 2025

But the spectre of AI is looming for 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. For the world of video games, 2025 was more about what didn’t happen than what did. It was supposed to be the year in which the blockbuster of all blockbusters, Grand Theft Auto VI, arrived to sweep all before it, but GTA VI has now been definitively (so Rockstar Games assures us) delayed until 19th November, 2026. In light of that, 2025 will go down as a decent if unspectacular year for video game design – but some interesting trends and talking points emerged over the last twelve months, many of which may get overlooked at tonight's The Game Awards. Indie game developers and AA releases found favour ahead of costly blockbusters, retro gaming and the nostalgia hit of remakes won over new and old fans alike, VR threatened to go big, then didn't, and AI seeped into every aspect of game development, and it's not leaving. So-called AA games – with significantly smaller budgets than the AAAs churned out by the big publishers – conspicuously received the majority of the plaudits from those with an interest in games design in 2025. Especially Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, from French developer Sandfall Games and publisher Kepler Interactive, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, made by tiny Australian indie Team Cherry. Honourable mentions are also due for Rebellion’s Atomfall and Supergiant Games’ Hades II. All those games boasted strong, distinctive art direction and the sort of personality and quirkiness that the big publishers seemed unable to deliver. Next year will mark ten years since the current wave of VR was first hyped as the next big thing in game design, not to mention the future of our everyday lives. But just as the much-touted metaverse has failed to take off, that vaunted, hardware-shifting killer VR game has also stubbornly failed to appear. We had some good VR games in 2025, such as Alien: Rogue Incursion, that brought the industrial-futurism of the films to life, while Midnight Walk's hand-made claymation style felt original and demanded attention. So, while there are some fun and innovative VR games out there, there’s also a sense that unless VR headsets become drastically less uncomfortable and restrictive, and more affordable, VR will never achieve the mainstream heights once ascribed to it. And after a decade, is its crunch time approaching? Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. The games industry’s biggest money-makers are its annual franchises, churned out regularly by the mega-publishers. But are they finally starting to show signs of flagging? EA Sports’ FC 26 arrived with something of a mea culpa – a raft of changes touted as a response to fan criticism of FC 25. Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will probably snatch the coveted Christmas number one sales spot, but received a lukewarm welcome, with its (admittedly praised) Warzone element under pressure from an unheralded newcomer, ARC Raiders. And it was a disastrous year for perennial so-called live service games, with Sony cancelling Concord mere weeks after a disastrous launch, along with seven other live-service games purportedly under development. In both video games and the wider world, 2025 was indisputably the year of AI. And in the games world, familiar fears of AI replacing the likes of voice-artists, character artists and dialogue writers were voiced – perhaps fallaciously, since videogames have embraced AI since the mid-1990s. AI has already been used to ease and speed up game development, via techniques like procedural generation, and generative AI was used by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and ARC Raiders. But gamers are vigilantly looking out for so-called AI slop – which some less-scrutinised mobile games have been criticised for – and will cry foul if that creeps into console and PC games. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 couldn't escape accusations of AI use, while on the flipside, Ubisoft revealed its new game, Teammates, is built around the use of gen AI. Likewise, EA and Krafton have invested heavily in gen AI workflows. AI in video games doesn't look like stalling, but it leaves room for non-AI, human-made games to succeed in a heavily vigilant market. 2025 was a great year for remakes and remasters of old games – classics like the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games, Resident Evils 2 and 4, Broken Sword, the Dragon Quest games and The Elder Scrolls Oblivion received the modern-tech remake treatment, and the final instalment of Square Enix’s brilliant reimagining of Final Fantasy VII will arrive in 2026. Even Clair Obscur had retro-style turn-based gameplay, and solo-developer games (inevitably with retro-adjacent graphics) like Citizen Sleeper 2 and Quantum Witch created a stir. Redesigned hardware from Evercade and the brilliant Sinclair GamerCard helped make retro gaming more accessible, and the year is ending how it began, with the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate proving one of 2025's most hyped games. In 2025, gamers felt the most creative games came from indie, rather than major publishers. All the AA-games covered above were published by indies, and the likes of horror games Look Outside and No, I’m Not A Human, plus Ball x Pit and Blue Prince, were showered with praise for innovating. The list really is a good one for 2025: Skate Story, The Drifter, Rematch, Lushfoil Photography Sim, as well as the upcoming Will: Follow the Light. The best games from majors – Avowed, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Battlefield 6, Split Fiction, Death Stranding 2, Borderlands 4 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows – overwhelmingly had a whiff of “seen it all before” to them. And when Electronic Arts became the subject of a leveraged private equity buyout, it had to counter accusations that it would lose interest in its non-annual franchises like Mass Effect. The successful arrival of the Switch 2 demonstrated that Nintendo, while a major pillar of the games industry, still operates in its own unique way. The Switch 2 remains pricey and conceptually near-identical to its predecessor. However, I suspect that next year will see it really come into its own, when first-party titles are added to supplement Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the recently released Metroid Prime 4, and crucially, it finally allows Nintendo-heads to play cross-platform blockbusters that were previously the sole province of Sony or Microsoft consoles. The rash of games industry layoffs that started in 2022 tailed off somewhat in 2025 but, to the dismay of all, by no means ended. Studios owned by the likes of Ubisoft, Amazon Games, 2K Games, Funcom and Square Enix were either shuttered or had their workforces slashed, albeit with most layoffs occurring in the US. Over-capacity after the world took to gaming during the Covid lockdown and overestimation of the appeal of live-service games caused that particular trend, but the industry hopes it’s finally approaching its endgame.

Title: Bitcoin dips after Fed’s 25 bps cut – Is BTC’s 2026 rally at risk?

Weak bids and macro volatility cloud Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. The market is taking the Federal Reserve’s move with cautious optimism. The recent 25 bps rate cut to 3.50–3.75% by the Fed on the 10th of December marks the third cut of 2025. Consequently, traders are now eyeing a potential liquidity boost, putting Bitcoin [BTC] back on the radar. But that’s not all. One key point in the Fed’s statement is that they’ll start buying $40 billion in U.S. T-bills over the next thirty days. By doing this, the Fed injects extra short-term liquidity back into the banking system. Source: X Simply put, the U.S. economy is about to get a fresh wave of liquidity. With another 25 bps rate cut and $40 billion in Treasury bill buys from financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is clearly trying to push cheaper capital back into the system as labor-market risks start creeping higher. And yet, BTC has reacted with a 2.14% dip, breaking below $90k. Notably, this move is no fluke. The Fed may be boosting short-term liquidity, but it’s also stirring concern about longer-term risks, especially as markets start pricing in a pause in rate cuts heading into 2026. It appears investors were already prepared for Bitcoin’s volatility. From mining firms to BlackRock, millions in BTC were unloaded ahead of the FOMC. With inflation still running hot and the Fed split on how aggressively to cut rates next year, investors are clearly staying cautious. And that caution isn’t misplaced. Over the last four FOMC meetings, Bitcoin has repeatedly pulled back. In fact, after the October FOMC, BTC slid almost 30% to $80k, marking its first major flash crash of 2025. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Against this setup, the question remains: Is history about to repeat itself? A recent Glassnode report highlights weak bids around $90k, reinforcing the cautious sentiment. Add aggressive selling by smart money, and Bitcoin is clearly in a supply-skewed setup, signaling potential downside pressure. Looking ahead, BTC’s base-building for a Q1 2026 rally is still uncertain.

Title: State Street, Galaxy and Ondo join tokenized cash race with 24/7 sweep fund

State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are launching a tokenized private liquidity fund on Solana, with Ondo expected to invest $200 million. State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are joining forces with Ondo Finance on a tokenized liquidity fund that will push cash “sweep” balances directly onto public blockchains, creating a potential source of 24/7 onchain liquidity. The planned State Street Galaxy Onchain Liquidity Sweep Fund, or SWEEP, is designed to take in and pay out PayPal’s (PYUSD) stablecoin for accredited investors, the companies said on Tuesday. Ondo is expected to seed the fund with $200 million, tying a major tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer directly into State Street’s tokenization stack. The fund will be powered by Galaxy Digital infrastructure, while State Street Bank and Trust Company, an affiliate of State Street Investment Management, will act as custodian. SWEEP is set to launch on Solana in early 2026, with rollouts on other networks, including Stellar and Ethereum, to follow, using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related: Solana and Coinbase’s Base connect together using Chainlink The move drops another heavyweight into an increasingly crowded race to define what “onchain cash” looks like for institutions. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already run tokenized cash‑management vehicles, including money‑market and other short‑term fixed‑income funds, on public blockchains. For its part, Ondo has built a business around wrapping Treasurys and other credit exposures into onchain vehicles that can plug into crypto markets. “By partnering with Galaxy, we will push the envelope together and drive the evolution of the TradFi landscape onchain,” said Kim Hochfeld, global head of cash and digital assets for State Street Investment Management. “Tokenization is rapidly becoming the connective tissue between traditional finance and the onchain economy,” said Ian De Bode, president of Ondo Finance. “Our planned investment would not only anchor this innovative fund – but also supports the continued growth of Ondo’s fund that offers institutional investors exposure to short-term US Treasuries with 24/7 instant mints and redemptions.” Related: Blockchain trial on Canton Network tests collateral reuse with tokenized US Treasurys The launch comes as tokenized funds and tokenized equities are starting to resemble components of an emerging onchain capital markets stack more than isolated pilots. Superstate opened up onchain capital raising for US Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered public companies via its Direct Issuance Programs on Ethereum and Solana Wednesday, targeting the equity side of that stack by letting issuers sell new stock directly for stablecoins and settle immediately to investor wallets. State Street’s partnership with Galaxy and Ondo also highlights how the roles are shaping up as traditional finance and crypto firms share the same products. State Street brings Big Four regulatory cover and custody, Galaxy contributes digital‑asset infrastructure and tokenization expertise, and Ondo provides both capital and an existing RWA distribution network. Related: Galaxy expands into UAE as part of Middle East push Solana’s role as the initial venue highlights a second competitive race unfolding beneath the product arms race. The chain has become a favored home for tokenized assets and high‑throughput trading, from tokenized public shares to experiments in onchain liquidity funds, as issuers look for lower fees and fast settlements. Some of the largest institutions in the world have chosen the Solana blockchain for their digital assets play, including Western Union, which processes over $100 billion in remittance volume every year, and Pfizer, which processes $2 trillion of merchant payment volume annually. Physical staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Solana have reached almost $1 billion in assets under management. Launching on Solana first, with plans to expand to Stellar and Ethereum, will allow SWEEP to tap into multiple ecosystems where stablecoins and RWA tokens are already part of the infrastructure.

Title: XRP ETFs close in on $1bn inflows as investors drive ‘new price discovery’

About us Copy link Demand for XRP exchange-traded funds shows no signs of ebbing. Spot ETFs backed by the Ripple-linked crypto have attracted $954 million in investment since Canary Capital’s blockbuster November debut, SoSoValue data shows. That is triple the $293 million in Solana products over the same window. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.5 billion in selling, while Ethereum ETFs also bled $471 million, DefiLlama data shows. ETFs are “significant flow machines,” Hyunsu Jung, CEO of treasury firm Hyperion DeFi, told DL News. They “play a key role in providing market participants with regulated access to the underlying tokens and can push assets to new price discovery in bullish environments,” Jung said. The leading performance of XRP ETFs — four straight weeks of positive inflows — comes amid a stagnant crypto market that is still down over $1 trillion from its October peak. XRP’s token price is at $2.01, or 45% below its all-time high set in July. Analysts have told DL News they see ETF proliferation as a key catalyst. Macroeconomic factors are also critical to crypto ETF performance, according to Jung. “We believe that additional liquidity will become available in global markets as central banks end quantitative tightening and lower interest rates, which often has flowed to more risk-on assets,” he said. The Federal Reserve on Thursday cut interest rates by another 0.25%, bringing its key lending rate to the lowest level in three years. When asked about Vanguard’s late entry into the crypto ETF arena, Jung said, “it was inevitable.” “Vanguard has recognised at this point that Blackrock, Fidelity and other platforms build massive digital asset ETF franchises, and seen the broader global institutional adoption of digital assets as both stores of value and critical technology infrastructure.” Jung said he anticipates new ETFs linked to other crypto tokens, such as HYPE, which powers the perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. “We expect ETFs for Hyperliquid such as 21Shares or BItwise Hyperliquid ETF,” Jung said. “If approved, will see significant institutional demand from traditional asset managers looking to gain exposure to one of the highest-revenue-generating blockchain platforms.” “Unique on-chain products like Hyperliquid and Polymarket should benefit from increasing global adoption as awareness of digital infrastructure continues to proliferate,” he said.

Title: Americans barely own gold — and that means prices could climb even further, Goldman says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-price-today-us-ownership-upside-goldman-sachs-outlook-forecast-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-11T07:13:21Z
Full Content:
Gold's record rally this year has grabbed headlines, but American investors barely own any of it, which means the yellow metal's price could have more room to run, according to Goldman Sachs. Even with gold hitting repeated highs, US ownership hasn't budged much. Gold ETF exposure is still six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, below its 2012 peak since the launch of gold ETFs in the mid-2000s, according to Goldman's analysis published on Wednesday. The low gold allocation is simply because "portfolio growth has outpaced gains in gold prices and volumes over the past decade," Goldman's analysts wrote. And while gold has surged to new all-time highs in 2025, Goldman's analysis shows that the rally hasn't translated into meaningful increases in actual US ownership. Gold ETFs make up just 0.17% of private US financial portfolios as of the second quarter — a microscopic slice of the roughly $112 trillion Americans hold in stocks and bonds, according to Goldman's analysis. Goldman's data also shows that fewer than half of large US institutions managing over $100 million hold any gold ETF position at all. Among those that do, allocations typically sit between 0.1% and 0.5%. For major long-term investors, only about 0.2% of their portfolios are in gold. Despite the social media buzz around Costco gold bars and US Mint coin sales, the report notes that physical gold demand in the US is tiny compared with ETF flows — just 11 to 15 metric tons year-to-date, versus roughly 400 tons of net ETF buying. That low ownership stands in sharp contrast to recommendations coming from major market voices, including Citi, UBS, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, advising investors to add gold to their portfolios. The gap between those recommendations and reality is exactly what Goldman says could push gold's next leg higher. The bank estimates that every 1-basis-point, or 0.01 percentage point, increase in gold's share of US financial portfolios would push gold prices up by about 1.4%. Goldman argues that if households or institutions meaningfully boosted their gold exposure as a diversifier — especially amid global macro uncertainty, including concerns about the fiscal outlook — such inflows could "substantially raise prices" in the small gold market. The bank forecasts gold to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, but says that forecast carries "significant upside risk" if private-sector buying broadens beyond the central banks that have dominated demand in recent years. The spot gold price hit a record high near $4,400 per troy ounce in late October and has since pulled back to around $4,220 per ounce. Prices are up 60% so far this year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto statue lands on NYSE in sign of changing times
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/satoshi-nakamoto-statue-nyse-bitcoin
Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:13:26Z
Full Content:
There are five other Satoshi statues made by Valentina Picozzi located around the world, in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam and Miami, in the US state of Florida. The New York Stock Exchange has become the sixth host of Valentina Picozzi’s “disappearing” Satoshi Nakamoto statue — a striking shift from just a few years ago when crypto was still taboo on Wall Street. Long seen as a bastion of traditional finance, the NYSE called the installation “shared ground between emerging systems and established institutions” in an X post on Wednesday. The statue was installed by Bitcoin (BTC) firm Twenty One Capital, which began trading this week. The design itself is the work of Picozzi, who wrote on X under her Satoshigallery handle that seeing her latest piece in such a high-profile setting is “mind-blowing.” “This is such an achievement, even in our wildest dream we wouldn’t think about placing the statue of Satoshi Nakamoto in this location! The 6th/21 statues of Satoshi Nakamoto found its home in the NYSE,” she added. It also happens to coincide with the anniversary of the Bitcoin mailing list, which Nakamoto launched on Dec. 10, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin in history and planting the seeds for the crypto industry we see today. Over a year later, on May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin, paying 10,000 Bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. In the intervening years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faced many challenges, as institutions and banks shunned them, and governments allegedly attempted to suppress them through efforts such as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. However, it has since turned a corner, as skeptics, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have changed their minds about the technology, and institutions and Wall Street have scrambled to invest through vehicles like exchange-traded funds and directly by holding Bitcoin in their treasuries. Public and private companies, countries and ETFs now collectively hold more than 3.7 million Bitcoin, according to Bitbo, worth more than $336 billion. Picozzi has five other Nakamoto statues around the world, located in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam, and Miami, Florida. Related: Disappearing Satoshi statue in Lugano took 21 months to create, says artist Picozzi, under her Satoshigallery handle, said she is committed to placing 21 around the world, a possible reference to the theoretical 21 million Bitcoin maximum supply. Speaking to Cointelegraph last year, she said Nakamoto is one of the most intriguing and fascinating figures of this era, and the statues stand as a tribute to the person behind Bitcoin. “The statue itself wants to give to the viewer this feeling of disappearance, and the sense that the inventor stays between the lines — as of today, Satoshi exists in the lines of the Bitcoin code, allowing humanity to have the first decentralized payment system,” she said.

Title: Ukraine sends US new plan to end the war as Trump blasts Europe

A man goes up the steps from an underground passage next to the memorial for the fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters on the Independence Square in Kiev, on Dec. 10, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) Ukraine has sent Washington an updated plan for ending Russia's invasion, Ukrainian officials told AFP Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first U.S. plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kiev and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia's hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it "takes into account Ukraine's vision — it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues". "We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side," the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a U.S. plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kiev and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as "decaying" and "weak" on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new U.S. national security strategy said the continent risked "civilisational erasure". "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine's European allies put on a show of support for Zelensky as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest U.S. proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked "wasting time". "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added. "They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we'll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don't want to be wasting time". 'Let people fight it out' Talks between U.S. officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelensky, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader — who Trump has accused of not reading the plan — said on Tuesday the plan had been broken down into three documents — a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine's post-war recovery. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky said he had held an online meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine's recovery. "This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media. "We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment," he added. But U.S. leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. "Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don't," Trump said on Wednesday. "But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you're losing thousands of people a week. It's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous." Former Iraqi President Barham Salih, who once fled Saddam Hussein’s persecution, has been named the next U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, marking a break from the long-standing practice of choosing leaders mainly from major European donor countries. Türkiye’s current account posted a net surplus of $457 million in October, according to Central Bank data released on Dec. 12. A high-stakes showdown in Norway awaits as Brann hosts Turkish giant Fenerbahçe on Dec. 11, with both clubs battling for critical positioning in the UEFA Europa League league phase.

Title: Tiger teeth, dried seahorses and shark fins sold illegally on Facebook, BBC finds
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91072g59no
Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:01:53Z

Endangered species, including tiger body parts, shark fins and pangolin scales, are being offered for sale on Facebook, BBC News has found. One Chinese user posted videos of a tiger in a cage that was for sale as well as pictures of tiger bones and teeth, while another included two live tiger cubs in a box. An image showed a tiger head and bones for sale piled up on scales. A seller told the BBC his products "can be shipped to the UK". He said a 10cm-long tooth would cost 2,000 Chines yuan (about £213) and that he could sell me tiger bones for 3,600 yuan per kilo (about £380). Another seller, who was offering shark fins, claimed to ship from the US to the UK and charged $50 per kilo (about £37). The sale of endangered species such as tigers and pangolin is illegal in the UK and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, closely regulates international trade in species under threat. The voluntary agreement, signed by more than 180 countries and other bodies, only allows the trade if it is both legal and sustainable. It comes as Interpol has announced the results of a global crackdown on the wildlife trade, which it says led to the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals. Meta, which owns Facebook, says it does not allow the sale of endangered species and removes such content. The UK has strict laws on what species can be imported legally. However, BBC News also found British companies selling dried seahorses, which can only be traded in the UK if the seller can certify they were sustainably harvested. In practice, that's not possible and supplying them is likely to break the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, punishable by a fine or prison sentence. One seller was found promoting them as a tonic for mothers who have just given birth and as a medicine for combating coughs. There is no scientific evidence to support this. When contacted, the seller - based in the north of England - immediately sent pictures of the seahorses they had in stock. Ordering online cost just over £60. Two days after placing the order three packets containing 15 dead, dried seahorses arrived in the post. The delivery had no documentation about the origin of the specimens but did include a recipe on how to make soup with them. The BBC showed the samples to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, who said it "made him sick to his stomach". He said they could only have been supplied illegally. Three pregnant males were among the order - male seahorses carry as many as 200 young. Mr Garrick-Maidment says that, kilo for kilo, seahorses are currently worth as much as silver and warned further price rises could mean they are fished to extinction. The global trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth £17bn per year and Interpol assesses it to be the fourth largest international crime type behind drugs smuggling, people smuggling and arms trafficking. The pangolin, which is the only mammal completely covered in scales, has become the most trafficked animal on earth and is now critically endangered. A seller in Laos was found to be offering pangolin scales for sale on Facebook. He told the BBC he charged $150 per kilo. One user even offered to sell rhino horn and suggested making contact via private message. In a statement, Meta said: "We do not allow the sale of endangered species on our platforms." The social media platform says it takes down that kind of material as soon as it becomes aware of it, saying it encourages users to "report any content they think may violate our policies". Today Interpol announced the result of Operation Thunder, a month-long global initiative to combat the trade in endangered species. Authorities in 134 countries were involved in the operation which included the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals and 30 tonnes of animal parts. Interpol says the growth in live animal seizures is driven by the exotic pet trade, but the market in bushmeat is also on the rise. Kenyan authorities seized 400kg of giraffe meat as part of the global crackdown and, in Belgium, primate flesh was found. More than 4,000 shark fins were also intercepted. Danny Hewitt, Border Force's director for UK command operations who oversaw the British arm of Op Thunder, said there had been a 73% increase in seizures compared to 2023. That included live snakes, tarantulas and lovebirds found hidden in vehicles stopped at the UK border. As populations move to the UK they drive demand, he added. The trade has been driven by organised crime, and in many cases, customers who don't understand the harm they are doing. Mr Hewitt added: "They may not have been illegal in other parts of the world, but they are illegal in the UK." California's governor Gavin Newsom issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order. The BBC asked people in Toronto and DC if they think an Australian-style, under-16 social media ban would work in Canada and the US. The new sonar technology hopes to help protect the fish on the River Dee from predators. There are hopes the partnership will safeguard endangered species "for generations to come". The world-first law aims to reduce the risks children face online, but critics fear it may not work. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| December 10, 20259:57 pm| 17 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine Just a quick housekeeping note: last night in comments, Gin & Tonic had a very good and important response to my remarks regarding whether Ukraine is losing. There’s not enough time tonight to get to the important strategic issue that it raises, which is how to win the war AND secure the peace. I will try to get to this tomorrow. Before we start, here’s Ukraine’s outgoing fires this evening/overnight: Ukrainian channels report that over 400 drones flew to Russia. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 4:37 PM President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian leaders continue to go through the motions with the US to demonstrate that they’re not being obstructionist, which has led to the emergence of a twenty point proposal. The Ukrainians are doing this because they know that Russia has already rejected any agreement that doesn’t reward Russia by giving them everything Putin wants. Ushakov was quoted by Russian media on Sunday as saying that the United States would have to “make serious, I would say, radical changes to their papers” on Ukraine. He did not clarify what changes Moscow wanted Washington to make. The Kremlin has said it expects Kushner to be doing the main work on drafting a possible deal. David Ignatius provides the details at The Washington Post: The negotiating package involves three documents, a Ukrainian official told me: the peace plan, security guarantees and an economic recovery plan. The talks are far from over, with Ukraine and European supporters planning to release a joint set of amendments Wednesday. But here are some of the ideas being explored, as described to me this week by U.S. and Ukrainian officials: • Ukraine would join the European Union as early as 2027. This rapid accession worries some E.U. powers. But the Trump administration thinks it can overcome opposition from Hungary, which has been Kyiv’s biggest E.U. opponent. Membership would foster trade and investment. But perhaps most important, it would force Ukraine to control its pernicious culture of corruption in state-owned businesses. At bottom, this war has been about whether Ukraine can become a European country. President Vladimir Putin detests that idea, with his mystical belief in the oneness of Russia and Ukraine. Quick E.U. membership for Kyiv looks to me like victory. • The United States would provide what are described as “Article 5-like” security guarantees to protect Ukraine if Russia violates the pact. Ukraine wants the U.S. to sign such an agreement and have Congress ratify it; European nations would sign separate security guarantees. A U.S.-Ukrainian working group is exploring how the details would work — and how fast Ukraine and its allies could respond to any Russian breach. The reliability of the U.S. guarantees is arguably undermined by language in the National Security Strategy that seems to erode the NATO alliance, on which the guarantees are modeled. But the Trump team says it’s committed to continuing U.S. intelligence support for Ukraine, which is the sine qua non of security. • Ukraine’s sovereignty would be protected from any Russian veto. But negotiators still seem to be struggling with delicate issues like limits on Ukraine’s army. There’s talk of raising an initial U.S. proposal for a 600,000-soldier army to 800,000, which is roughly what Ukraine would have anyway, postwar. But Kyiv refuses any formal constitutional cap, as Russia wants. Whatever the nominal size of the army, officials say there might be supplements like the national guard or other support forces. • A demilitarized zone would be established along the entire ceasefire line, all the way from the Donetsk province in the northeast to the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Behind this DMZ would be a deeper zone in which heavy weapons would be excluded. This line would be closely monitored, much like the DMZ that divides North and South Korea. • “Land swaps” are an inescapable part of the deal, but Ukraine and the U.S. are still haggling over how the lines would be drawn. Russia demands Ukraine give up the roughly 25 percent of Donetsk it still holds; the Trump team argues that Ukraine is likely to lose much of that in battle over the next six months, in any event, and should make concessions now to spare casualties. U.S. negotiators have tried various formulas to make this concession more palatable for Zelensky. One idea is that the withdrawal zone would be demilitarized. Zelensky insisted Monday that he has “no legal right” to cede territory to Russia. One way to finesse this issue is the Korea model — to this day, South Korea claims a legal right to the entire peninsula and North Korea asserts the same. • The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, would no longer be under Russian occupation. Negotiators are discussing the possibility that the United States might take over running the facility. Strange as it may sound, that appeals to some Ukrainian officials because it would provide an American tripwire against Russian aggression. • The Trump administration would seek to foster investment and economic development in Ukraine. One source of funds would be the more than $200 billion in Russian assets now frozen in Europe. Trump’s negotiators already proposed making $100 billion of that stash available to Ukraine for reparations. The amount might be increased. More at the link. This is not just going to continue to be a non-starter for Ukrainians, we already know, as the quote above indicates, that anything other than full capitulation is unacceptable to Putin and Russia. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson noted that Ukraine agreed to all six proposals that Trump presented this year, while Russia did not support any of them.

Moreover, Trump has adopted a new demand as a result of his regular and ongoing phone calls with Putin: Zelenskyy has to go because Ukraine isn’t a democracy because they haven’t held elections during the war. ⚡️US needs ‘answers’ before next meeting with Zelensky, Trump says. Trump did not discuss specific conditions of the peace deal but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic” and asked when Ukraine would hold presidential elections. [image or embed] — The Kyiv Independent (@kyivindependent.com) December 10, 2025 at 5:32 PM From The Kyiv Independent: (emphasis mine) European officials want to arrange a meeting this coming meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and American leadership to discuss peace in Ukraine, but the White House first needs “answers,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on Dec. 10. Trump told reporters that he spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on Dec. 10. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words, and we’ll see what happens,” he said. “I mean, we’re waiting to hear answers.” According to Trump, the European leaders want to hold a meeting involving both him and Zelensky in Europe this weekend, but the White House requires further persuasion before agreeing to attend. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with,” he said. “We don’t want to be wasting time.” Trump did not discuss the details of any proposed peace framework but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic.” He also mused aloud about Ukraine’s next round of presidential elections. “I think (Zelensky) has to be realistic and I do wonder about, how long is it going to be before they have an election,” Trump said. “It’s a democracy. It’s been a long time.” On the same day, Zelensky told reporters that Ukraine could be ready to hold elections during Russia’s full-scale war if the U.S. and European allies work to ensure security. Zelensky then said he discussed the issue with members of the Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 10. “I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine,” the president said in his evening address. “If our partners, including our key partner in Washington, talk so much and so specifically about the elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legitimate Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt.” Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections in Ukraine are banned under martial law, which went into effect after Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. While Kyiv has previously held firm on the need to postpone elections until the end of the war — or at least a ceasefire — Trump’s emphasis on elections in the latest push for a deal have brought about a shift. Polling also shows Zelensky’s popularity to have hit a low point in the fallout of a major corruption scandal that saw his second-in-command, Andriy Yermak, resign from office. Though Trump has expressed impatience with Ukraine for slow progress on a peace agreement, the Kremlin meanwhile has given no sign of easing its maximalist demands — including calls for Ukraine to cede territory it still controls. To sum up: “Biden gave Ukraine $350 billion. And you know what I gave them? Nothing.” — Trump. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) December 9, 2025 at 4:00 AM And he hates Zelenskyy too: Here is President Zelenskyy’s address from earlier today. Video below, English transcript after the jump. 10 December 2025 – 20:52 I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was an extremely busy day, and the coming days will also be serious. We spoke with the American team on economic matters – on reconstruction matters. I want to thank Secretary Bessent, Jared Kushner, and Larry Fink of BlackRock for being fully constructive. The key principle we share is that, to ensure reconstruction is of high quality and economic growth is tangible after this war, real security must form the foundation. When there is security, everything else follows. The 20 points for ending the war form a fundamental document. We are actively working on the key steps – and they must be doable steps. From this fundamental document, we are developing two additional ones – at least two. And the first is on security – regarding security guarantees for Ukraine with the United States, and the second is on the economy – covering reconstruction and joint investments. Today, we focused specifically on the economic document. And on the Ukrainian side, I was accompanied by Ukrainian government officials: Prime Minister of Ukraine Yuliia Svyrydenko, Deputy Prime Minister Kachka, Ministers Sybiha and Sobolev, and First Deputy Foreign Minister Kyslytsya. Our defenders were also represented in all discussions; today, General Hnatov joined us in the economic talks. The principles of the economic document are absolutely clear, and we are fully aligned with the American side on this – I want to thank them for today’s video meeting. An economic action plan will follow. Europe will also be involved in reconstruction, certainly. In the near future, we plan to move forward on the other two documents as well. Rustem Umerov will continue the discussions. For tomorrow, we are preparing a Coalition of the Willing meeting – over 30 countries working with Ukraine to ensure security on land, in the air, and at sea. Next week, we will coordinate with Europe in bilateral formats. Ukraine is working swiftly; every visit and every negotiation we conduct always yields practical results for our defense and for our resilience. Today, our combat aviation has been reinforced – thank you. Details are not yet public, but we continue to strengthen our forces in the sky. Today, there is also an additional sanctions step in Europe – more sanctions will target Russian tankers and the entire Russian oil transport infrastructure – and this is right. In December, Ukraine will present its own package of sanctions against the tanker fleet working for the war, and we will extend this pressure through joint formats with our partners. There will be new steps against Russian propagandists as well. Today, I also received a report from the Head of Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service – including on the enemy’s economic situation and Russia’s growing dependence on China. Throughout Russian history, no one has ever surrendered sovereignty so much to China or any other major power. And it is astonishing how much Putin is paying just to avoid ending this war. Yet the world still has sufficient strength to end this war – to force Russia into doing so. Peace is needed. I want to thank everyone who is helping. And one more thing. Today, I spoke with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. We had a substantive discussion. I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine. If our partners – including our key partner in Washington – are speaking so much and so concretely about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, we must provide legal Ukrainian responses to every question and every doubt. This is not easy, but we definitely do not need any pressure regarding this. I expect that the People’s Deputies of Ukraine will present their perspective. Security challenges depend on our partners, primarily the United States, and political and legal challenges must be addressed by Ukraine. And they will be. Glory to Ukraine! Georgia: The longest daily civic resistance in the contemporary world is marking Day 378. The regime banned protests even on pavements, however their de facto President still has to sign it. #GeorgiaProtests 📷 Tata Peradze [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 2:58 PM Today, on December 10, GD adopted a law that effectively prohibits marching on sidewalks in protest without permission.

Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. 1/3 www.independent.co.uk/voices/russi… [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From former UK National Security Advisor and Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill at The Independent: (emphasis mine) Yet again this week, President Trump set Europe’s strategic challenge. Despite reaffirming US commitment to Euro-Atlantic defence once allies pledged to invest more ourselves, his new national security strategy pivots to the Pacific while his Ukraine peace plan negotiates European security without European input. Europe might not be on our own, but we need the capability to be self-reliant. And fast. As national security adviser, I dealt with the Salisbury poisonings, about which Lord Hughes’s inquiry reported last week. It was a turning point. After years of inadequate responses to Syria, Crimea, MH17, Litvinenko and Russian subversion, we decimated Russian intelligence capability with the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history and imposed genuinely painful sanctions. Yet even that success was fundamentally defensive. We responded to an attack that had already been executed. We established consequences but not deterrence. The truth is, we are already at war: conventional war in Ukraine, hybrid war elsewhere. Putin certainly believes he is at war with us. As I told parliament recently, Russia could bring Britain to a standstill with a cyber attack on our food distribution system, coupled with an information operation to create panic buying and public disorder. No missiles or troops required. Sun Tzu wrote: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected”. Nato too should manoeuvre in this grey zone. We could target Russian vulnerabilities, including ageing energy infrastructure, dependence on Western systems, an isolated Kaliningrad enclave, and concentrated military-industrial facilities. We should deny insurance to Russia’s shadow fleet, impound vessels in Nato waters and pass extra-territorial legislation enabling Nato navies to respond to cable attacks in international waters. We should demonstrate our capability to mount cyber attacks against Russian energy and military infrastructure. And we should apply systematic pressure to its Kaliningrad enclave, which relies on land and sea access via Nato territory. Won’t this provoke Russian escalation? Putin invaded Ukraine, uses chemical weapons, shoots down civilian aircraft, sabotages infrastructure, assassinates dissidents and subverts democracy, all without facing severe consequences. Yet Nato is mesmerised by fear of retaliation, while Russia follows Lenin’s doctrine of continuous escalation until met with steel. The risk is not that we provoke attacks. They are attacking us already. The risk is that failing to impose a price invites further aggression. Some argue this requires unanimous European support we cannot secure. Wrong question. Several allies – Nordics, Baltics, Poland – who understand the threat are ready. France and Germany will follow once we demonstrate resolve. Coalitions of the willing have repeatedly moved the Nato consensus. Waiting for permission guarantees continued Russian aggression. Putin regards the UK as Russia’s most implacable adversary. Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. Our strategic culture is not paralysed by fear. We understand that credible deterrence is offensive, not just defensive, striking where Russia is vulnerable, forcing them to defend everywhere, imposing costs through means difficult to predict. This is a hybrid war of manoeuvre. Europe needs a nation willing to spearhead it. Britain should be that nation. This is all strategically sound. It would be easier if Britain could make up its mind over whether it is in or out of Europe. And if the current Labour government wasn’t busy self immolating by attempting to implement the centrist commentators and consultants recommendations the goal of which is to make Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias spontaneously orgasm. Denmark: The world is upside down 😐 [image or embed] — Kate from Kharkiv (@kateinkharkiv.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From CNN: Denmark has labeled the United States as a potential security concern for the first time in an annual report released by one of its intelligence agencies, offering more evidence of the increasingly fraught transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US. The report, compiled by the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS), warns that the US “uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies.” That assessment forms part of the service’s wider analysis that “great powers increasingly prioritize their own interests and use force to achieve their goals.” CNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Copenhagen and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Washington for comment. Apart from its warning relating to the US, the report largely focuses on strategic threats posed by Russia and China, as well as instability brought about by China’s rise and the resulting global shift in power. It points out that the “military threat from Russia to NATO will increase,” a concern magnified for the Danes since “there is uncertainty about the role of the United States as a guarantor of Europe’s security.” Denmark’s normally friendly relationship with its NATO ally grew strained earlier this year when US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of Greenland, an autonomous, resource-rich, strategically significant Arctic island that is legally part of the Danish kingdom. That relationship is once again under scrutiny as the differing strategic priorities of the US and Europehave been exposed in the recent Ukrainian peace talks and, most dramatically, in the national security strategy released Friday by the Trump administration, which adopted an unprecedented confrontational posture toward Europe And for Denmark, the threats posed by Russia and the US are intertwined. The report argues that “Russia will try to exploit the US desire for a quick end to the (Ukraine) war to sow division between the US and Europe.” The threat of Russian sabotage groups infiltrating Ukraine from Transnistria is growing. Sources in Ukraine’s military intelligence tell 24 Kanal that Moscow is rapidly stepping up activity in the region to stretch Ukrainian resources and create a new front.

YY_Sima Qian December 11, 2025 at 12:02 am I don’t think Putin has surrendered any sovereignty to the PRC (on the parallel of Muscovy to the Golden Horde, for example), but he has certainly allowed the PRC to gain enormous leverage over Russia. HumboldtBlue December 11, 2025 at 12:21 am I’d like to clarify that I just realized I posted a link last night that I didn’t properly quote, and it may have led a commenter to think that was me. Pfft, my cat has more cogent comment on current affairs than I do. That is Paul Warburg. Many people say that Ukraine can’t possibly win its war against Russia, because Russia is a much larger opponent. But this doesn’t match even with Russia’s own recent history. In this video, I talk about the growing Ukrainian insurgency movement in the occupied Donbas region, and how it is making a meaningful difference on the battlefield. I map this to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, a war that they ultimately lost due to insurgency. I then talk about why this matters for any peace deals between Ukraine and Russia, showing why failing to understand these dynamics will almost certainly lead to a peace that doesn’t last. Here is his latest post from earlier today. Also, while we’re on the subject of the horrors of war, here is Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise, based on a manga by Kazuyoshi Takeda, joins films like “Grave of the Fireflies” and “In This Corner of the World” in using anime to portray the horrors of the war. Grave of the Fireflies, like Come and See, will break one down, and are at the top of the list of movies you may not wanna watch again. bad Jim December 11, 2025 at 12:38 am I found the piece by Mark Sedwill pretty thrilling. Any mention of threatening Kaliningrad gratifies my black heart. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:27 am As always, thank you, Adam. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:47 am Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 16h War historian Antony Beevor explained in an interview with The Telegraph why Russia commits such atrocities in Ukraine: He argues that Russia has historically developed a belief that conspicuous cruelty is a necessary weapon of war. According to the historian, while Europe went through the Enlightenment and attempted to “civilize” war by creating the Red Cross and similar attitudes. Russia, however, did not embrace this evolution. ◾️ Beevor links modern cruelty not only to army traditions, but also to deeply rooted violence within Russian society. Putin’s soldiers, he emphasizes, often become victims of abuse themselves. The historian recalls how, in the 1990s, while working in Russian archives, he learned that “there were up to 5,000 suicides a year” among conscripts in the Soviet Union, and Soviet generals found this funny. Now, Beevor notes, Russian conscripts are killing themselves because they are subjected not only to bullying but also to persecution and torture. The command often approves of this ‘tradition’ of treating recruits. ◾️ Beevor calls this phenomenon a “knock-on theory of oppression”: having experienced violence themselves, soldiers then take it out on the defenseless. This is what happened in Germany in 1945, and it was repeated in all wars in which Soviet and then Russian troops participated. When asked whether cruelty is considered legitimate in Russia, the historian replied that Russians “don’t give a damn about legitimacy, to be perfectly honest.” ◾️ The war will end someday, and hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers will return home. What will happen when people accustomed to violence, looting, and murder find themselves among the civilian population? “We’ve already been hearing anecdotal evidence of appalling crimes being committed,” Beevor said. He highlighted the Russian command’s inhumane treatment of its own troops: mobile crematoria at the front, the use of convicts in “punishment” units for demining and suicide attacks – all of which are a continuation of old practices. “They’ve certainly been using the idea of punishment battalions that Stalin actually copied from the Germans,” Beevor added. ◾️ The historian warned that if the Kremlin considers its campaign in Ukraine successful, the Baltic states could be the next target. He recalled the lessons of the past: after World War I, the British and French could not believe that anyone would want another war, and therefore underestimated Hitler. “We’ve seen a similar thing in the 2000s Nobody believed that anyone would want to have another ground war on the European landmass again. [Under Putin], the sheer brutality of the Russian way of war could well be reapplied on the European landmass,” Beevor concluded. 📹: Chechen poet Apti Bisultanov on the Russian army, March 2006 Dec 10, 2025 · Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 12h Those who believe or claim that “if Ukraine gives up part of its territory – or even the whole country – peace will come” either do not understand how the Russian state operates or are deliberately misleading others. It’s enough to look at what Russia does wherever it manages to entrench itself: each occupied territory is turned into a space where land, infrastructure and people are either destroyed or repurposed to serve Russia’s economy and war effort. And this is not a “new course” for the Kremlin. Historically, Russia has never stopped at what it seized: it incorporated, subdued, and exploited. In the early 20th century, during the civil war and “Sovietization” of Ukraine, the same pragmatic formula applied: control of territory = control of the population. Registration, coercion, mobilization, repression, “re-education.” The war was not only for land – it was to turn society into a resource. Russia’s wars in Chechnya demonstrated the very same logic: the defiant were killed, the rest became fully controlled. Today, in the occupied Ukrainian territories, we see the same steps: ▪️ First, “legalization” of control through passportization: a Russian passport equals survival. Access to healthcare, employment, property, social benefits, education, and even movement is tied to having Russian documents. This is not bureaucracy, it is a mechanism to force people to “fit into” the occupation order. A century ago, the Bolsheviks used registers, commissariats, certificates and supply control for the same purpose: if you wanted to survive, you had to be registered and kept under the system’s control. ▪️ Second, the repressive framework. Occupation brings with it filtration, detentions, torture, “cases” for disloyalty – and systematic hunting for those capable of organizing resistance: veterans, activists, journalists, civil servants, teachers. In 1918-1921, the Bolsheviks consolidated power in exactly the same way – not through persuasion, but through punitive infrastructure: first crush the elites and alternative institutions, then “rewire” society. ▪️ Third – the most terrifying: turning people into “human resources” for war. In the occupied territories, Russia is pulling Ukrainians into its draft system through registries, military commissariats, and forced “status changes”; expanding contract enlistment through blackmail and dependency; and using places of detention as channels of coercion. According to data from the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, presented by Dmytro Usov at Crimea Global, from February 2022 to July 2025 Russia forcibly mobilized 46,327 Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territories; it was also reported that former Ukrainian servicemen were being used, that units were formed (two battalions and two detachments), and that 62 contracts had been signed. The historical parallel is direct: in 1918, the Red Army quickly became a mass conscription machine, and the Ukrainian population was used as a mobilization reserve for the imperial center; even during the Winter War of 1939-1940, formations from Soviet Ukraine (notably the 44th and 70th divisions) were sent to the Finnish front, and Ukrainian sources estimate up to ~40,000 Ukrainians killed in that war. ▪️ Fourth, long-term planning – children and identity. Under Russian occupation, “patriotic” and military upbringing, cadet programs, preparation for service in Russian structures, and pressure on the Ukrainian language and curriculum are launched. Early Soviet rule operated in exactly the same way: to raise a “new person,” impose one history, one loyalty – and create a generation more easily mobilized and controlled. ▪️ And finally – economy and territory as a staging ground. Occupied lands are reconfigured to fit Russian supply chains and wartime needs, while the territory itself is repurposed for military logistics and basing. A hundred years ago, the imperial center viewed Ukraine the same way – as a critical resource base for grain, industry, transport hubs – and subordinated all of it to war. Today the principle is the same, only the tools are more modern. ‼️ This is why the occupation of Ukraine that Russia dreams of is not the “end of the war” for Russia. It is a resource that Putin wants to obtain for future wars: • human (draft and contracts); • territorial (a forward operating platform); • economic (restructured production and logistics); • ideological (re-educating children and normalizing violence). History shows a simple truth: when Russia gains control of a territory, it converts it into control over people – and into the capacity to wage further wars. nitter.poast.org/Gerashchenko_en There is more,…………………. Doug December 11, 2025 at 4:11 am Speaking of Ignatius, accession to the EU cannot be accomplished in two years. Getting the prospective member state to integrate the EU’s acquis of directives into national law is an immensely complicated and mind-bendingly detailed project. Actual EU membership features a degree of integration that reaches into every aspect of national regulation, and it cannot be rushed or hand-waved away.

New policymaker projections issued after the U.S. central bank's final two-day meeting of 2025 showed a median expectation for a single quarter-percentage-point cut next year, the same as in September. But it was accompanied by a wide range of estimates that starkly illustrated the depth of disagreement about where to take monetary policy in 2026 and beyond in an economy being reshaped by President Donald Trump's policies and an artificial intelligence investment boom. "In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data," the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a policy statement that was tweaked to add language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions - an outlook at odds with market expectations still leaning toward two rate cuts in 2026. Policymakers' refreshed estimates - hindered by incomplete data about the economy after a six-week government shutdown - also showed they expect inflation to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%, an outlook that should dispel worries about potential stagflation that have persisted this year. The wide disagreement on the appropriate policy for such an environment also showed how challenging it could be to build a consensus in a policymaking body about to experience a leadership change, with Trump expected to nominate a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell within the next few weeks. In a press conference after the meeting, Powell said: "I would note that having reduced our policy rate by 75 basis points since September and 175 basis points since last September, the fed funds rate is now within a broad range of estimates of its neutral value, and we are well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves." Powell, who repeatedly referenced being in a strong position to wait on the next move, added, though, that Fed officials have made no decision about what to do with rates at their next policy meeting in late January. Major U.S. stock indices closed higher, while the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies and Treasury yields dropped. "The 25-basis-point rate cut was widely expected and the economic projections remain optimistic. I would view this as a semi-dovish, cautious statement," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. "The markets are applauding this decision." Other analysts pointed to the wide range of policymaker views on the outlook for rates. "It's definitely a hawkish cut, not so much in the fact that we had two dissenters that wanted to stand pat, but if you look at the 'dot plot,' there were six of them that penciled in no rate cut at this meeting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. The dot plot graphic of Fed policymaker rate-path projections showed six "dots" at 3.9%, where the policy rate was before the rate cut on Wednesday. The decision to lower the benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 3.50%-3.75% range drew three dissents, with Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joining Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in arguing the policy rate should be left unchanged, and Fed Governor Stephen Miran again advocating a larger half-percentage-point reduction. How monetary policy evolves from here, heading into a U.S. midterm election year that could revolve around the performance of the economy and with Trump urging sharper rate reductions, will now hinge on data that is still lagging from the impact of the 43-day federal government shutdown in October and November. The projections are in a sense optimistic: Interest rates may remain higher than anticipated, but the economy is seen growing faster even as inflation falls and the jobless rate also eases lower. But the latest policy statement and projections were crafted without the benefit of recent job and inflation reports, and instead relied on "available indicators," which Fed officials have said include their own internal surveys, community contacts and private data. The most recent official data on unemployment and inflation is for September, and showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% from 4.3%, while the Fed's preferred measure of inflation also increased slightly to 2.8% from 2.7%. The Fed has a 2% inflation target, but the pace of price increases has risen steadily from 2.3% in April, a fact at least partly attributable to the pass-through of rising import taxes to consumers and a driving force behind the central bank's policy divide. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. "Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace," the Fed's policy statement said. "Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September," it said, dropping a reference to the jobless rate as "low." The updated projections showed a core of six policymakers preferring no rate cut this year, and seven anticipating no further cuts in 2026. The median projection is for one additional quarter-percentage-point cut in 2027 as well, as inflation continues to subside towards the central bank's 2% target. "Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while, although continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25-basis-point cut into the mix for January," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock and one of the five finalists Trump is considering as a successor to Powell.

UPDATED 18:50 EST / DECEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped more than 10% in extended trading today after the cloud and database giant missed expectations on quarterly revenue while going full-steam ahead on its ongoing artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout. The company reported second-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.26 per share, easily beating Wall Street’s target of $1.64 per share. However, though revenue grew by 16% from a year earlier, to $16.06 billion, it fell short of the $16.21 billion analyst estimate. In terms of profitability, Oracle showed a big improvement, with net income of $6.14 billion in the quarter, up from just $3.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. However, the company’s guidance was perhaps a tad discouraging for investors. Oracle executives said they’re looking for earnings of between $1.70 and $1.74 in the third-quarter, which is only in-line with the Street’s forecast of $1.72. The company also called for revenue growth of between 19% and 21% versus the Street’s $16.87 billion estimate, which implies 19% growth. Oracle said it delivered $7.98 billion in cloud revenue during the quarter, above the $7.92 billion consensus estimate. Within that segment, cloud infrastructure revenue came to $4.1 billion, up 68% from a year ago. Today was the first quarterly earnings call by Oracle’s new co-Chief Executive Officers Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, who took over the job from former CEO Safra Catz in September. In a call with analysts, Sicilia highlighted a number of new cloud infrastructure customer wins with companies including Airbus, Deutsche Bank, LSEG, Panasonic, Canon and Rubrik. Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann told SiliconANGLE that it’s quite telling that Sicilia felt the need to highlight so many customer wins during the call. “The market has been really nervous about Oracle’s overreliance on OpenAI and other AI plays from a RPO and forecast perspective, so this litany of customer wins and apps growth acceleration shows some welcome diversity,” she said. Oracle’s software business didn’t fare so well, however, with revenue declining 3%, to $5.88 billion, falling short of the Street’s $6.06 billion estimate. On the other hand, Oracle’s future does look promising, with the company pointing to remaining performance obligations that soared 438% from a year ago, to a staggering $523 billion. RPO, as the metric is known, refers to contracted revenue that has not yet been realized, and is really a measure of the company’s enormous backlog of orders, mostly for cloud infrastructure capacity. Wall Street had been forecasting RPO of $501.8 billion. Oracle Principle Financial Officer Doug Kehring said on the call that the increase was the result of new commitments by customers including Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp. and others, and told analysts that the company is hoping to be able to convert this revenue sooner than expected. “This is good news for Oracle and its capex story,” Wettemann said, referring to Oracle’s runaway capital expenditures. The company has been trying to position itself at the center of the AI boom by committing to a massive data center buildout, and expects capex to increase to $50 billion this year, up from $21.2 billion in the previous fiscal year. While the increased capex has boosted the company’s revenue and backlog, some investors have become worried about the enormous amounts of debt it has taken on to fund its investments. Much of Oracle’s backlog stems from OpenAI Group PBC, which has committed to spending more than $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure services over the next five years. “The longer the backlog sits there, the greater the risk that Oracle can’t monetize it, or the AI landscape changes enough that certain customers can’t pay on their commitments,” Wettemann explained. Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller said some eagle-eyed investors may have noted that Oracle’s growing revenue is coming at a steep cost, resulting in lower profitability as it generates more sales. “The problem is that the $2 billion in cloud revenue growth only translated to around half a billion in operating income,” the analyst said. “At the same time, Oracle keeps spending like a drunken sailor on capex and is cash flow-negative by $13 billion. While this could end up great if AI pans out, it could also become a problem.” Kehring tried to reassure investors, telling analysts on the call that the company remains committed to maintaining its investment-grade debt rating. “There are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,” he said. “Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.” Mueller agreed that the debt Oracle has been taking on isn’t a problem. “With interest payments at approximately $1 billion, the debt load is more than manageable for the company,” he said. The company said its earnings during the quarter were boosted by a $2.7 billion pretax gain on the sale of its interest in chip design business Ampere, which is set to be acquired by SoftBank Group Corp. for $6.5 billion. Oracle announced the sale in March. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison (pictured), who remains the company’s most influential executive, said the decision to sell Ampere was taken because he thinks it no longer makes sense to continue designing, manufacturing and using its own chips in its data centers. “The company is committed to a policy of chip neutrality,” he said. “[It needs] to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy.” The earnings call comes on the back of a 23% drop in Oracle’s share price last month, its worst monthly performance since 2021. But although the stock declined further today, it’s still up more than 33% in the year to date, ahead of the broader, technology-focused Nasdaq index, which has gained just 22% this year.

Title: Congress Advances Historic Crackdown On American Cash Fueling China

A long-sought crackdown on U.S. funding of China’s military and strategic industries is on the verge of becoming law after House lawmakers successfully embedded sweeping outbound-investment restrictions into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House passed the massive $900 billion defense policy bill Wednesday, setting the stage for a Senate vote next week before the measure heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. Backers of the outbound investment curbs — including Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky — call it the “strongest framework in history” for safeguarding American capital and strengthening national security. “This legislation takes President Trump’s America First Investment Policy to the next level and puts Beijing on notice,” said Barr, who introduced the Foreign Investment Guardrails to Help Thwart (FIGHT) China Act included in the House version of the NDAA. “Congress is sending a clear message: no more American money for the [Chinese Communist Party] to build missiles aimed at our troops, the next spy balloon that will fly over our communities, or any other product that could harm Americans.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: US Nuclear Bomber Fleet Shares Fence With Trailer Park Linked To Chinese Intel-Tied Fraudster) WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 7: Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) speaks with Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on May 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images) If enacted, the provision would prohibit U.S. investments in sensitive Chinese technologies, require domestic firms to notify the Treasury Department of certain transactions in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and empower the Treasury secretary to sanction Chinese entities tied to the country’s military or intelligence services. Lawmakers attempted to attach similar language to defense funding bills in both 2023 and 2024 but were ultimately unsuccessful. Notably, the measure ran into resistance in 2023 from then-House Financial Services Committee chair and Republican North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, who said that more U.S. private investment in China would prevent Beijing from taking state control of them. The push now has broad bipartisan support and strong backing from China hawks who warn that billions in American capital have fueled PRC critical-technology firms, including those linked to the Chinese military, the surveillance state and the CCP’s genocide against Uyghur Muslims. In 2023 alone, major American financial institutions like BlackRock steered $6.5 billion into 63 Chinese companies blacklisted by the U.S. government for supporting the CCP military or human-rights abuse, according to the House Select Committee on the CCP. The restrictions would also extend to investments in other nations that are U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. “President Trump has made clear the past few decades of investments propping up Communist China’s aggression must come to an end,” said Speaker Mike Johnson, calling the inclusion of investment restrictions an “important step to protect our nation’s national security and economic competitiveness.” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who sponsored the Senate version of the FIGHT China Act, also said he is pleased the effort is nearing the finish line. “This landmark legislation would prohibit and require notification of U.S. investments in certain technologies in countries of concern, ensuring American ingenuity, innovation, and investment do not end up in the hands of adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party to be weaponized against us,” said Cornyn. Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida likewise called the measure a “huge win” for national security, cutting off “American investors to feed the Beijing military machine.” The investment curbs also have Democratic backing, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who co-sponsored the Senate bill and called it an “important step toward ensuring the United States remains the world’s leader in advanced technology.” Among the other victories for China hawks in the NDAA is the BIOSECURE Act, which limits federal contracts with biotechnology firms linked to foreign adversaries such as the PRC. The provision was previously sidelined in 2024 after Democrat Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts — then chair of the House Rules Committee — intervened to protect jobs tied to one of the targeted Chinese companies in his district. Despite the NDAA’s new restrictions on China, the president announced Monday that the U.S. will allow Nvidia to ship its advanced H200 AI processors to approved customers in China in exchange for a 25% surcharge. Critics argue the move risks eroding America’s technological edge and undermining long-term national security, noting that China is unlikely to produce a domestic equivalent before at least late 2027. While the defense bill cleared the House, it drew objections from several Republicans who criticized the authorization of additional security assistance to Ukraine and other foreign countries, the omission of provisions to ban a central bank digital currency, and the inclusion of certain DEI-related provisions.

UKRAINE HAS SENT Washington an updated plan for ending Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian officials have said, as US President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first US plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia’s hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it “takes into account Ukraine’s vision – it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues”. “We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side,” the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to a US plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kyiv and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as “decaying” and “weak” on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new US national security strategy said the continent risked “civilisational erasure”. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words,” Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine’s European allies put on a show of support for Zelenskyy as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest US proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked “wasting time”. “I think we had some little disputes about people, and we’re going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump added. Advertisement “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”. Talks between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelenskyy, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader – who Trump has accused of not reading the plan – said yesterday the plan had been broken down into three documents – a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine’s post-war recovery. Earlier today, Zelenskyy said he had held an online meeting with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine’s recovery. “This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on social media. “We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment,” he added. But US leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don’t,” Trump said on Wednesday. “But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you’re losing thousands of people a week. It’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous.” - © AFP 2025 To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

Title: Ukraine says it struck Russian shadow fleet oil tanker in Black Sea | CNN
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/europe/ukraine-strikes-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-intl
Time Published: 2025-12-10T20:56:18Z
Full Content:
Ukraine struck an oil tanker belonging to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Wednesday, according to an official in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). A Ukrainian security source told CNN that Sea Baby maritime drones were used in a joint operation by the SBU and the navy. It was the third attack against Russian tankers in two weeks. Russia has been using hundreds of tankers, flying different flags, to clandestinely ship its oil to customers in defiance of Western sanctions. The Dashan tanker, which was flying the flag of the Comoro Islands, suffered “critical damage,” with preliminary information indicating the ship was “disabled,” the source said. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Video obtained by CNN shows a Sea Baby drone diving under the tanker before a series of explosions in the vessels’s stern area. Thick plumes of smoke then engulf the tanker. It was not immediately clear what cargo the vessel was carrying or whether the strike caused an oil spill. The ship was traveling at top speed through Ukraine’s exclusive economic zone, with its transponder turned off, when it was hit, the SBU source said. The vessel had been moving toward Russia’s Novorossiysk port terminal, a key Russian oil hub, the source added. The port was hit last month, when Ukraine struck one of Moscow’s largest oil export facilities. The attack, acknowledged by officials from both countries, marked an escalation of Kyiv’s efforts to target a key source of Russian war revenue. “The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce oil dollar revenues to the Russian budget,” the source said. The Ukrainian military operation follows a similar strike on two Russian shadow fleet tankers in late November. The SBU said the strike dealt a “significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.” The latest Ukrainian assault followed US President Donald Trump claim Tuesday that Moscow has the “upper hand” in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and that Kyiv is “losing” the war. Multiple Ukrainian and European officials have disputed Trump’s claims, although Ukraine’s position is acknowledged to be challenging. There are no new US or European assessments to suggest there have been significant changes on the battlefield that indicate Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces will triumph anytime soon, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile, talks over a US-proposed peace deal between Ukraine and Russia are continuing but have not achieved a breakthrough. US and Ukrainian delegations met virtually Wednesday to discuss plans for the reconstruction and economic development of Ukraine after the war with Russia ends, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X. The US delegation included Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock, according to the Ukrainian leader. “We discussed key elements for recovery, various mechanisms and visions for reconstruction. There are many ideas that, with the right approach, could succeed in Ukraine,” Zelensky said. The Ukrainians also “updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war,” he said. Zelensky thanked Trump and his team “for their substantive work and support.” CNN’s Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Business Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan makes a speech on stage in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. REUTERS/Ann Wang SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 : When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEOIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGYTan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.”According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITALSoon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova.Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUPIn 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications.In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said.Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.

Title: US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again as labour market risks grow

A divided US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Thursday for a third consecutive time this year, but signalled that it could hold off further reductions in the coming months. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is “well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here”. The Fed’s statement on its decision also brought back language used in late-2024 to signal a pause in more rate cuts. Powell stressed that officials are in a good position to determine the “extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks”. Wednesday’s reduction by a quarter percentage point brings rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%, the lowest in around three years, a move aligned with market expectations. The Fed pencilled in one more rate cut next year, and flagged heightened risks to employment as it announced its latest decision. But a rift within the central bank deepened with three officials voting against the modest reduction. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid to support keeping rates unchanged. Fed governor Stephen Miran again backed a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Fed’s rate-setting committee has 12 voting members - including seven members of the board of governors, the New York Fed president and a rotation of reserve bank presidents - who take a majority vote in deciding on rates. Powell noted that some disagreement was expected, pointing to tensions between inflation risks and a weakening jobs market: “It’s a close call.” “Inflation is well above the Fed’s target, but the job market appears to be softening,” said Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike Fratantoni in a statement. “Thus, there is ammunition for both sides of the debate” within the Fed, he added. For now, Powell said, the Fed is “in the high end of the range of neutral” rates, with neutral being a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. The Fed has previously described interest rates as “modestly restrictive” - “neutral” could suggest less justification to lower levels quickly. “We expect the Fed will want to pause for a while to allow time to for this and prior cuts to feed through the economy,” said economist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics. Powell added that the US economy needs several years where wages are higher than inflation for “people to start feeling good about affordability.” On Thursday, Fed officials also lifted their 2026 growth forecast, while easing inflation expectations and keeping their unemployment rate projection unchanged. These forecasts could shift as the central bank grapples with a delay in federal economic data releases after a record-long government shutdown. This week’s gathering is the last before 2026, a year of key changes for the bank. A new chief will arrive after Powell’s term ends in May, while political pressure mounts. On Thursday, Trump said the Fed could have “at least doubled” its rate cut. The president also signaled in a Politico interview published on Wednesday that he would judge Powell’s successor on whether they immediately slash rates. Interviews for his choice are entering the final stages, and Trump’s chief economic adviser Kevin Hassett is among top contenders. Miran’s term expires in January, creating an opening among the Fed’s top leadership. Trump has sought to free up another seat by attempting to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook too. Cook has challenged her ousting and the case remains before the courts. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco noted that Hassett’s potential appointment and a “more hawkish rotation of voting members” focused more on taming inflation means a growing dispersion in views. “Policy deliberations are likely to become even more divided next year,” he said. - Agence France-Presse OPINION: Social media age limit for teens is an overdue public health protection.

Title: Will Meta Platforms (META) Stock Hit $1,000 in 2027?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Derick Hudson / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Guided by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a business seeking a direction. Is Meta Platforms a social media giant, a metaverse pioneer, or an artificial intelligence (AI) technology trailblazer? Some investors have expressed disappointment about the performance of Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs metaverse/virtual reality (VR) business unit. On the other hand, Meta Platforms has more than 4 billion eyeballs on its social media applications globally. Thus, Meta Platforms is a force to be reckoned with and META stock could be poised for significant upside. In an optimistic scenario, the Meta Platforms share price could even reach $1,000 by the end of 2027 — but don’t place any bets until you’ve reviewed the catalysts and concerns. Since 2025 is nearly over, we can assess the year’s performance of Meta Platforms stock. The shares are up 11% year to date and are only up 5% over the past 12 months. That’s a decent performance, but it’s nothing to write home about. Frankly, META stock hasn’t been so magnificent lately even though Meta Platforms is a member of the Magnificent Seven. To hit $1,000 by the end of 2027, Meta Platforms stock would have to rise 54% from its current price of approximately $650. Even with a strong finish in December of this year, META stock would need to gain around 25% in 2026 and another 25% in 2027. At least, we can say that Meta Platforms stock looks reasonably valued after a decent but not spectacular 2025. At the moment, Meta Platforms has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.79x, which isn’t excessive for a mega-cap technology firm. While it doesn’t appear to be over-valued, Meta Platforms will still need to demonstrate robust financial growth for META stock to reach $1,000. So, let’s take a glance at the most recent quarterly data and analyze Meta Platforms’s growth trajectory. Here are the need-to-know data points. In the third quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ total revenue grew 26.2% year over year to $51.242 billion versus $40.589 billion in the year-earlier quarter. As usual, the majority of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.082 billion for Q3 2025) came from the company’s Advertising segment. Looking at it from another angle, nearly all of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.772 billion) was derived from the company’s “Family of Apps” (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). Suffice it to say, then, that app-based advertisements continue to be Meta Platforms’ bread and butter. Turning to the company’s bottom-line results, Meta Platforms’ net income declined 82.7% from $15.688 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $2.709 billion in Q3 2025. This occurred despite Meta Platforms aforementioned revenue growth. There’s no need to panic about this, though, as Meta Platforms’ year-on-year net income decline may just be a one-time tax-accounting issue. As it turns out, the company’s “provision for income taxes” jumped from $2.134 billion in 2024’s third quarter to $18.954 billion in the third quarter of 2025. The critics may be willing to overlook Meta Platforms’ steep net income drop-off, but there’s another possible objection. In particular, they could complain that Meta Platforms relies heavily on social media app ad revenue. That may be the case, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to expand Meta Platforms into new, intriguing technology fields. Will the CEO’s bold vision be a boon for Meta Platforms, though? After multiple quarters of operating losses from Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs division, investors may be relieved to see Zuckerberg shifting his attention to AI instead of the metaverse. Lately, there’s been talk about Meta Platforms possibly gearing up to introduce next-generation AI glasses next year. However, Meta Platforms will need to effectively parlay its legions of app users into a loyal base of AI tech consumers. Until that happens, Meta Platforms’ foray into AI technology will be quite costly. From 2024’s third quarter to Q3 2025, Meta Platforms’ research and development expenses ramped up 35.5%, from $11.177 billion to $15.144 billion. Plus, there are no signs that Meta Platforms’ spending spree will end anytime soon. Just this year, Meta Platforms expects to have spent a mind-blowing $72 billion on AI technology. Over the next three years, the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure and job investments, presumably to include AI tech development. It’s a costly pivot, and there’s no assurance that Meta Platforms will convert its millions of eyeballs into enthusiastic AI glasses wearers. Remember, Meta Platforms tried to get consumers to wear VR headsets but that didn’t work out as planned. Meta Platforms can rely on its massive app advertising revenue for growth, but the next chapter in the company’s story hasn’t been written yet. Zuckerberg’s AI obsession may turn out to be a costly misstep, just as Reality Labs ended up. Hence, it’s possible but unlikely that META stock will gain 25% in 2026 and then gain another 25% in 2027. Getting Meta Platforms shares to $1,000 is a tall order that would require strong evidence that the company’s spending spree is justified.

Title: AI Business Deals Are Getting a Bit 2008-ish

The last time so much wealth was tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on December 12, 2025 A company that most people have never heard of is among the year’s best-performing technology firms—and a symbol of the complex, interconnected, and potentially catastrophic ways in which AI companies do business these days. CoreWeave’s IPO in March was the largest of any tech start-up since 2021, and the company’s share price has subsequently more than doubled, outperforming even the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. On Wall Street, CoreWeave is regularly referred to as one of the most important companies powering the AI revolution. In the past few months, it has announced a $22 billion partnership with OpenAI, a $14 billion deal with Meta, and a $6 billion arrangement with Nvidia. Not bad for a former crypto-mining firm turned data-center operator with zero profits and billions of dollars in debt on its books. CoreWeave’s business model consists of buying up lots of high-end computer chips, and building or leasing data centers to house those chips. It then rents out those assets to AI companies that need computing power but prefer not to take on the huge up-front costs themselves. If this is straightforward enough, CoreWeave’s financial situation is anything but. The company expects to bring in $5 billion in revenue this year while spending roughly $20 billion. To cover that gap, the company has taken on $14 billion in debt, nearly a third of which comes due in the next year. Many of these loans were issued by private-equity firms at high interest rates, and several use complex forms of financial engineering, such as giving the money to newly formed legal entities created for the explicit purpose of borrowing on CoreWeave’s behalf (more on that later). CoreWeave also faces $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. From the May 2025 issue: The new king of tech The money that CoreWeave is making, meanwhile, comes from just a few intimately connected sources. A single customer, Microsoft, is responsible for as much as 70 percent of its revenue; its next biggest customers, Nvidia and OpenAI, might make up another 20 percent, though exact numbers are hard to find. Nvidia is also CoreWeave’s supplier of chips and one of its major investors, meaning CoreWeave is using Nvidia’s money to buy Nvidia’s chips and then renting them right back to Nvidia. OpenAI is also a major CoreWeave investor and has close financial partnerships with both Nvidia and Microsoft. All of this might make CoreWeave the purest distillation of a trend sweeping through the AI sector. In recent months, tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle have been making gargantuan investments in new data centers, tying together their fortunes through circular financing deals, and borrowing huge piles of debt from lightly regulated lenders. The companies and their most ardent backers argue that these deals will set them up to capture the limitless profits of the coming AI revolution. But the last time the economy saw so much wealth tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. If the AI revolution fails to materialize on the scale or the timeline that the industry expects, the economic consequences could be very ugly indeed. The extreme financialization of the AI sector reflects a simple reality: The infrastructure required to train and run AI systems is so expensive that not even the largest companies have enough cash to pay for it all. Spending on data centers is conservatively projected to exceed $400 billion this year, roughly the size of the economy of Denmark; McKinsey estimates that it will reach nearly $7 trillion by 2030. Creative measures are necessary to pay for all of this investment. At the center of the action is Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company. Companies that train and run AI systems, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, need Nvidia’s chips but don’t have the cash on hand to pay for them. Nvidia, meanwhile, has plenty of cash but needs customers to keep buying its chips. So the parties have made a series of deals in which the AI companies are effectively paying Nvidia by handing over a share of their future profits in the form of equity. The chipmaker has struck more than 50 deals this year, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI and (with Microsoft) a $15 billion investment in Anthropic. Formally, these transactions don’t obligate the AI companies to spend money on Nvidia’s chips—an Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “does not require any of the companies we invest in to use Nvidia technology”—but in practice, that’s where the money goes. OpenAI has made its own series of deals, including agreements to purchase $300 billion of computing power from Oracle, $38 billion from Amazon, and $22 billion from CoreWeave. Those cloud providers, in turn, are an important market for Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI has also invested in several smaller AI start-ups, which in exchange have agreed to pay for ChatGPT enterprise accounts. Even when represented visually, the resulting web of interlocking relationships is almost impossible to track. Together, these arrangements amount to an entire industry making a double-or-nothing bet on a product that is nowhere near profitable. A single company, OpenAI, is simultaneously a major source of revenue and investment for several cloud companies and chipmakers; a close financial partner to Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon; a significant customer for Nvidia; and a leading investor in AI start-ups. And yet the company is projected to generate only $10 billion this year in revenue—less than a fifth of what it needs annually just to fund its deal with Oracle. It is on track to lose at least $15 billion this year, and doesn’t expect to be profitable until at least 2029. By one estimate, AI companies collectively will generate $60 billion in revenue against $400 billion in spending this year. The one company that is making a lot of money from the AI boom, Nvidia, is doing so only because everyone else is buying its chips in the hopes of obtaining future profits. The AI companies and their boosters see this as a gamble worth taking. Demand for AI services, they point out, is growing at an exponential rate. According to calculations by Azeem Azhar, a widely cited AI-industry analyst, the direct revenues from AI services have increased nearly ninefold over the past two years. If that pace continues, then it’s only a matter of time before AI companies will begin making record-shattering profits. “I think people who fixate on exactly how these investments are being financed are stuck in an outdated way of thinking,” Azhar told me. “Everyone is assuming that this technology will improve at a linear pace. But AI is an exponential technology. It’s a whole different paradigm.” If, however, AI does not produce the short-term profits its proponents envision—if its technical advances slow down and its productivity-enhancing effects underwhelm, as a mounting body of evidence suggests may be the case—then the financial ties that bind the sector together could become everyone’s collective downfall. The extreme concentration of stock-market wealth in a handful of tech companies with deep financial links to one another could make an AI crash even more severe than the dot-com crash of the 2000s. And a stock-market correction might be the least of America’s worries. When equity investments go bad, investors might lose their shirts, but the damage to the real economy is typically contained. (The dot-com crash, for example, didn’t cause mass unemployment.) But the AI build-out is so expensive that it can’t be funded by equity investments alone. To finance their investments, AI companies have taken on hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, a number that Morgan Stanley expects to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2028. When a bunch of highly leveraged loans go bad at the same time, the fallout can spread throughout the financial system and trigger a major recession. The AI sector’s debt is, of course, not guaranteed to go bad. But the complex way in which it is arranged and packaged isn’t reassuring. For instance, earlier this year, Meta decided to build a new data center in Louisiana that will cost $27 billion. Instead of applying for a loan from a traditional lender, the company partnered with Blue Owl Capital, a private-equity firm, to set up a separate legal entity, known as a special-purpose vehicle, or SPV, that will borrow the money on Meta’s behalf, build the data center according to Meta’s instructions, and then lease it back to Meta. Because Blue Owl is technically the majority owner of the project, this setup keeps the debt off of Meta’s balance sheet, enabling the company to keep borrowing at low interest rates without worrying about a hit to its credit rating. Other companies, including xAI, CoreWeave, and Google, have borrowed or plan to borrow huge sums through similar kinds of arrangements. Meta has described its arrangement with Blue Owl as an “innovative partnership” that is “designed to support the speed and flexibility required for Meta’s data center projects.” But the reason the credit-rating system exists is to give lenders and investors a clear sense of the risk they are taking on when they issue a loan. A long history exists of companies trying to circumvent that system. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, several major financial institutions used SPVs to keep billions of dollars in household debt off of their balance sheets. Enron, the energy corporation that famously collapsed in 2001 after a massive accounting scandal, used SPVs to mask its shady accounting practices. “When I see arrangements like this, it’s a huge red flag,” Paul Kedrosky, a managing partner at SK Ventures and research fellow at MIT who has written extensively about financial-engineering techniques, told me. “It sends the signal that these companies really don’t want the credit-rating agencies to look too closely at their spending.” SPVs aren’t the only 2008-era financing tool making a comeback. Data-center debt totaling billions of dollars is being sliced up into “asset-backed securities,” which are then bundled and sold to investors. This is not an inherently problematic way for companies to fund their borrowing. But Kedrosky argues that during periods of heightened speculation, these vehicles turn debt into a financial product whose worth is disconnected from the value of the underlying asset it represents—which can encourage reckless behavior. “Investors see these complex financial products and they say, I don’t care what’s happening inside—I just care that it’s highly rated and promises a big return,” Kedrosky said. “That’s what happened in ’08. And once that kind of thinking takes off, it becomes really dangerous.” Rogé Karma: Just how bad would an AI bubble be? Then there are the so-called GPU-backed loans. Several data-center builders and cloud providers, including CoreWeave, have obtained multibillion-dollar loans to purchase chips by posting their existing chips as collateral, just as many homeowners used their homes as collateral to take out loans for second and third homes in the 2000s. But, as Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise, notes in a recent report on the AI sector’s finances, whether that collateral will hold its value is far from clear. When new chip models are released, the value of older models tends to fall. According to Arun, if the collapse in chip prices were steep enough, a vicious cycle could ensue. As older chips fall in value, any loan using those chips as collateral suddenly becomes at risk of default. Lenders might respond by calling in their loans early, before companies have the revenue to pay them back. At that point, the lender might try to sell the chips to recoup their investment, but that will only flood the market with even more chips, driving down the values of existing chips even further, causing other lenders to call in their loans and so on. “A few months ago I would have told you that this was building toward a repeat of the dot-com crash,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “But all of this debt and financial engineering is making me increasingly worried about a 2008-like scenario.” The federal government responded to the 2008 crisis by limiting the ability of traditional banks to take on big, risky loans. Since then, however, private-equity firms, which aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as banks, have gotten more heavily into the lending business. As of early this year, these firms had lent about $450 billion in so-called private credit to the tech sector, including financing several of the deals discussed above. And, according to one estimate, they will lend it another $800 billion over the next two years. “If the AI bubble goes bust, they are the ones that will be left holding the bag,” Arun told me. A private-credit bust is almost certainly preferable to a banking bust. Unlike banks, private-equity firms don’t have ordinary depositors. In theory, if their loans fail, the groups that will be hurt the most are institutional investors, such as pension funds, university endowments, and hedge funds, limiting the damage to the broader economy. The problem is that nobody knows for certain that this is the case. Private credit is functionally a black box. Unlike banks, these entities don’t have to disclose who they are getting their money from, how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. This makes it impossible for regulators to know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy. Evidence is growing that the links between private credit and the rest of the financial system are stronger than once believed. Careful studies from the Federal Reserve estimate that up to a quarter of bank loans to nonbank financial institutions are now made to private-credit firms (up from just 1 percent in 2013) and that major life-insurance companies have nearly $1 trillion tied up in private credit. These connections raise the prospect that a big AI crash could lead to a wave of private-credit failures, which could in turn bring down major banks and insurers, Natasha Sarin, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in financial regulation, told me. “Unfortunately, it usually isn’t until after a crisis that we realize just how interconnected the different parts of the financial system were all along,” she said. An AI-induced financial disaster is far from inevitable. Still, given the warning signs, one would hope for the federal government to be doing what it can to reduce the risk of a crisis. Instead, the Trump administration is doing the opposite. In August, the president signed an executive order that instructs federal agencies to loosen regulations so that ordinary 401(k) holders can invest directly in “alternative assets” such as, yes, private credit, a change that could expose a far broader swath of the public to the fallout if AI loans go bad. Perhaps that is the key difference between 2008 and 2025. Back then, the federal government was caught off guard by the crash; this time, it appears to be courting one.

Title: King of Meat studio was reportedly expecting 100,000 concurrent players, but it peaked at 320 on Steam—and that was during a free weekend

Glowmade is now reportedly making layoffs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. An Insider Gaming report says Glowmade Games will lay off employees in January 2026 after its debut game, the Amazon-published King of Meat, flopped badly. While the number of employees being put out of work isn't known, sources told the site that the process began earlier this month with discussions about voluntary redundancies that would impact about a dozen people. Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn, comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a "co-op party platformer" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims "leadership"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches. That doesn't tell the full story, since King of Meat is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. But even if each of those platforms had 100 times as many players as Steam, which seems extremely unlikely, King of Meat would still only be 1/50th (figures approximate, I am bad at math) of the way toward the minimum number of players anticipated by management. That's not just a big flop, it also speaks very poorly of the judgment of the high-ups who thought this game would be a hit on that scale. We can't say for certain whether that reported figure is accurate, but we can say that a lot of money and effort was poured into marketing King of Meat, including an announcement trailer at the Geoff Keighley-hosted Opening Night Live show at Gamescom 2024—that couldn't have been cheap—and an entire Mr. Beast special, complete with $250,000 prize. Optimism is great—you won't get far in the videogame business without it—but the expectations placed on King of Meat were wildly out of place. And that's not just hindsight speaking: Turn the page back to that ONL reveal in August 2024, when PC Gamer senior editor Wes Fenlon said King of Meat "seems doomed to be a casualty of the live service era before it's even out." What comes next for King of Meat isn't clear, but probably nothing good. Amazon made major cuts to its gaming business as part of a massive wave of layoffs in October, which also saw it pull the plug on New World, a not-terribly-old MMO that was still attracting a decent audience. If New World can't make it on Amazon's watch, I don't imagine King of Meat has much hope for a bright future either.

Title: Is It a Bubble? By Howard Marks
URL: https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-12-10T17:30:43Z
Full Content:
Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. During my visits to clients in Asia and the Middle East last month, I was often asked about the possibility of a bubble surrounding artificial intelligence, and my discussions gave rise to this memo. I want to start off with my usual caveats: I’m not active in the stock market; I merely watch it as the best barometer of investor psychology. I’m also no techie, and I don’t know any more about AI than most generalist investors. But I’ll do my best. One of the most interesting aspects of bubbles is their regularity, not in terms of timing, but rather the progression they follow. Something new and seemingly revolutionary appears and worms its way into people’s minds. It captures their imagination, and the excitement is overwhelming. The early participants enjoy huge gains. Those who merely look on feel incredible envy and regret and – motivated by the fear of continuing to miss out – pile in. They do this without knowledge of what the future will bring or concern about whether the price they’re paying can possibly be expected to produce a reasonable return with a tolerable amount of risk. The end result for investors is inevitably painful in the short to medium term, although it’s possible to end up ahead after enough years have passed. I’ve lived through several bubbles and read about others, and they’ve all hewed to this description. One might think the losses experienced when past bubbles popped would discourage the next one from forming. But that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m sure it never will. Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that “everyone knows” will change the world. I took the quote that opens this memo from Derek Thompson’s November 4 newsletter entitled “AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself,” about parallels between what’s going on today in AI and the railroad boom of the 1860s. Its word-for-word applicability to both shows clearly what’s meant by the phrase widely attributed to Mark Twain: “history rhymes.” Understanding Bubbles Before diving into the subject at hand – and having read a great deal about it in preparation – I want to start with a point of clarification. Everyone asks, “Is there a bubble in AI?” I think there’s ambiguity even in the question. I’ve concluded there are two different but interrelated bubble possibilities to think about: one in the behavior of companies within the industry, and the other in how investors are behaving with regard to the industry. I have absolutely no ability to judge whether the AI companies’ aggressive behavior is justified, so I’ll try to stick primarily to the question of whether there’s a bubble around AI in the financial world. The main job of an investment analyst – especially in the so-called “value” school to which I subscribe – is to (a) study companies and other assets and assess the level of and outlook for their intrinsic value and (b) make investment decisions on the basis of that value. Most of the change the analyst encounters in the short to medium term surrounds the asset’s price and its relationship to underlying value. That relationship, in turn, is essentially the result of investor psychology. Market bubbles aren’t caused directly by technological or financial developments. Rather, they result from the application of excessive optimism to those developments. As I wrote in my January memo On Bubble Watch, bubbles are temporary manias in which developments in those areas become the subject of what former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called “irrational exuberance.’’ Bubbles usually coalesce around new financial developments (e.g., the South Sea Company of the early 1700s or sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities in 2005-06) or technological progress (optical fiber in the late 1990s and the internet in 1998-2000). Newness plays a huge part in this. Because there’s no history to restrain the imagination, the future can appear limitless for the new thing. And futures that are perceived to be limitless can justify valuations that go well beyond past norms – leading to asset prices that aren’t justified on the basis of predictable earning power. The role of newness is well described in my favorite passage from a book that greatly influenced me, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith wrote about what he called “the extreme brevity of the financial memory” and pointed out that in the financial markets, “past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” In other words, history can impose limits on awe regarding the present and imagination regarding the future. In the absence of history, on the other hand, all things seem possible. The key thing to note here is that the new thing understandably inspires great enthusiasm, but bubbles are what happen when the enthusiasm reaches irrational proportions. Who can identify the boundary of rationality? Who can say when an optimistic market has become a bubble? It’s just a matter of judgment. Something that occurred to me this past month is that two of my best “calls” came in 2000, when I cautioned about what was going on in the market for tech and internet stocks, and in 2005-07, when I cited the dearth of risk aversion and the resulting ease of doing crazy deals in the pre-Global Financial Crisis world. First, in neither case did I possess any expertise regarding the things that turned out to be the subjects of the bubbles: the internet and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. All I did was render observations regarding the behavior taking place around me. And second, the value in my calls consisted mostly of describing the folly in that behavior, not in insisting that it had brought on a bubble. Struggling with whether to apply the “bubble” label can bog you down and interfere with proper judgment; we can accomplish a great deal by merely assessing what’s going on around us and drawing inferences with regard to proper behavior. What’s Good About Bubbles? Before going on to discuss AI and whether it’s presently in a bubble, I want to spend a little time on a subject that may seem somewhat academic from the standpoint of investors: the upside of bubbles. You may find the attention I devote to this topic excessive, but I do so because I find it fascinating. The November 5 Stratechery newsletter was entitled “The Benefits of Bubbles.” In it, Ben Thompson (no relation to Derek) cites a book titled Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation. It was written by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, who propose that there are two kinds of bubbles: . . . “Inflection Bubbles” – the good kind of bubbles, as opposed to the much more damaging “Mean-reversion Bubbles” like the 2000’s subprime mortgage bubble. I find this a useful dichotomy. The financial fads I’ve read about or witnessed – the South Sea Company, portfolio insurance, and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities – stirred the imagination based on the promise of returns without risk, but there was no expectation that they would represent overall progress for mankind. There was, for example, no thought that housing would be revolutionized by the sub-prime mortgage movement, merely a feeling that there was money to be made from backing new buyers. Hobart and Huber call these “mean-reverting bubbles,” presumably because there’s no expectation that the underlying developments would move the world forward. Fads merely rise and fall. On the other hand, Hobart and Huber call bubbles based on technological progress – as in the case of the railroads and the internet – “inflection bubbles.” After an inflection-driven bubble, the world will not revert to its prior state. In such a bubble, “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.” As Thompson tells us: The definitive book on bubbles has long been Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. Bubbles were – are – thought to be something negative and to be avoided, particularly at the time Perez published her book. The year was 2002 and much of the world was in a recession coming off the puncturing of the dot-com bubble. Perez didn’t deny the pain: in fact, she noted that similar crashes marked previous revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution, railways, electricity, and the automobile. In each case the bubbles were not regrettable, but necessary: the speculative mania enabled what Perez called the “Installation Phase,” where necessary but not necessarily financially wise investments laid the groundwork for the “Deployment Period.” What marked the shift to the deployment period was the popping of the bubble; what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments. (All emphasis added) This distinction is very meaningful for Hobart and Huber, and I agree. They say, “not all bubbles destroy wealth and value. Some can be understood as important catalysts for techno-scientific progress.” But I would restate as follows: “Mean-reversion bubbles” – in which markets soar on the basis of some new financial miracle and then collapse – destroy wealth. On the other hand, “inflection bubbles” based on revolutionary developments accelerate technological progress and create the foundation for a more prosperous future, and they destroy wealth. The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress. Hobart and Huber go on to describe in greater depth the process through which bubbles finance the building of the infrastructure required by the new technology and thus accelerate its adoption: Most novel technology doesn’t just appear ex nihilo [i.e., from nothing], entering the world fully formed and all at once. Rather, it builds on previous false starts, failures, iterations, and historical path dependencies. Bubbles create opportunities to deploy the capital necessary to fund and speed up such large-scale experimentation – which includes lots of trial and error done in parallel – thereby accelerating the rate of potentially disruptive technologies and breakthroughs. By generating positive feedback cycles of enthusiasm and investment, bubbles can be net beneficial. Optimism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Speculation provides the massive financing needed to fund highly risky and exploratory projects; what appears in the short term to be excessive enthusiasm or just bad investing turns out to be essential for bootstrapping social and technological innovations . . . A bubble can be a collective delusion, but it can also be an expression of collective vision. That vision becomes a site of coordination for people and capital and for the parallelization of innovation. Instead of happening over time, bursts of progress happen simultaneously across different domains. And with mounting enthusiasm . . . comes increased risk tolerance and strong network effects. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, attracts even more participants, entrepreneurs, and speculators, further reinforcing this positive feedback loop. Like bubbles, FOMO tends to have a bad reputation, but it’s sometimes a healthy instinct. After all, none of us wants to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build the future. In other words, bubbles based on technological progress are good because they excite investors into pouring in money – a good bit of which is thrown away – to carpet-bomb a new area of opportunity and thus jump-start its exploitation. The key realization seems to be that if people remained patient, prudent, analytical, and value-insistent, novel technologies would take many years and perhaps decades to be built out. Instead, the hysteria of the bubble causes the process to be compressed into a very short period – with some of the money going into life-changing investment in the winners but a lot of it being incinerated. A bubble has aspects that are both technological and financial, but the above citations are from the standpoint of people who crave technological progress and are perfectly happy to see investors lose money in its interest. “We,” on the other hand, would like to see technological progress but have no desire to throw away money to help bring it about. Ben Thompson ends this discussion by saying, “This is why I’m excited to talk about new technologies, the prospect for which I don’t know.” I love the fact that he’s excited by future possibilities and at the same time admits that the shape of the future is unknown (in our world, we might say “very risky”). Assessing the Current Landscape Now let’s get down to what we used to call “brass tacks.” What do we know? First, I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t believe artificial intelligence has the potential to be one of the biggest technological developments of all time, reshaping both daily life and the global economy. We also know that in recent years, economies and markets have become increasingly dependent on AI: AI is responsible for a very large portion of companies’ total capital expenditures. Capital expenditures on AI capacity account for a large share of the growth in U.S. GDP. AI stocks have been the source of the vast majority of the gains of the S&P 500. As a Fortune headline put it on October 7: 75% of gains, 80% of profits, 90% of capex – AI’s grip on the S&P is total and Morgan Stanley’s top analyst is ‘very concerned’ Further, I think it’s important to note that whereas the gains in AI-related stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of the total gains in all stocks, the excitement AI injects into the market must have added a lot to the appreciation of non-AI stocks as well. AI-related stocks have shown astronomical performance, led by Nvidia, the leading developer of computer chips for AI. From its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1999, when its estimated market value was $626 million, Nvidia briefly became the world’s first company worth $5 trillion. That’s appreciation of around 8,000x, or roughly 40% a year for 26+ years. No wonder imaginations have been fired. What Are the Areas of Uncertainty? I think it’s fair to say that while we know AI will be a source of incredible change, most of us have no idea exactly what it will be able to do, how it will be applied commercially, or what the timing will be. Who will be the winners, and what will they be worth? If a new technology is assumed to be a world changer, it’s invariably assumed that the leading companies possessing that technology will be of great value. But how accurate will that assumption prove to be? As Warren Buffett pointed out in 1999, “[The automobile was] the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the 20th century. . . . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. So autos had an enormous impact on America but the opposite direction on investors.” (Time, January 23, 2012) In AI, there are some very strong leaders at present, including some of the world’s strongest and richest companies. But new technology is notoriously disruptive. Will today’s leaders prevail or give way to upstarts? How much will the arms race cost, and who will win? Similarly, what’s a share in an upstart worth? Unlike front runners worth trillions, it’s possible to invest in some would-be challengers at enterprise values in mere billions or even – might I say? – millions. On June 25, 2024, CNBC reported as follows: A team founded by college dropouts has raised $120 million from investors led by Primary Venture Partners to build a new AI chip to take on Nvidia. Etched CEO Gavin Uberti said the startup is betting that as AI develops, most of the technology’s power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. “If transformers go away, we’ll die,” Uberti told CNBC. “But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time.” Even granting the possibility that Etched won’t become the biggest company of all time, if success could give them a valuation just one-fifth of Nvidia’s peak – a mere $1 trillion – what probability of success would be required to justify an investment of $120 million? Assuming for simplicity’s sake that the investment was for a 100% ownership stake, all you need is a belief that achieving the trillion-dollar value has a probability of one-tenth of a percent for an expected return of over eight times your money. Who’s to say Etched doesn’t have that chance? And in that case, why would anyone not play? The foregoing is what I call “lottery-ticket thinking,” in which the dream of an enormous payoff justifies – no, compels – participation in an endeavor with an overwhelming probability of failing. There’s nothing wrong with calculating expected values this way. Leading venture capitalists engage in it every day to great effect. But assumptions regarding the possible payoffs and their probabilities must be reasonable. Thinking about a trillion-dollar payout will override reasonableness in any calculation. Will AI produce profits, and for whom? Two things we know little or nothing about are the profits AI will produce for vendors and its impact on non-AI companies, primarily meaning those who employ it. Will AI be a monopoly or duopoly, in which one or two leading companies are able to charge dearly for the capabilities? Or will it be a highly competitive free-for-all in which a number of firms compete on price for users’ spending on AI services, making it a commodity? Or, perhaps most likely, will it be a mix of leading companies and specialized players, some of whom compete on price and others through proprietary advantages. It’s said that the services currently responding to AI queries, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, lose money on every query they answer (of course, it’s not unusual for participants in a new industry to offer “loss leaders” for a while). Will the leading tech firms – used to success in winner-take-all markets – be content to experience losses in their AI businesses for years in order to gain share? Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to the race for AI leadership. Who will win, and what will be the result? Likewise, what will be AI’s impact on the companies that use it? Clearly, AI will be a great tool for enhancing users’ productivity by, among other things, replacing workers with computer-sourced labor and intelligence. But will this ability to cut costs add to the profit margins of the companies that employ it? Or will it simply enable price wars among those companies in the pursuit of customers? In that case, the savings might be passed on to the customers rather than garnered by the companies. In other words, is it possible AI will increase the efficiency of businesses without increasing their profitability? Should we worry about so-called “circular deals”? In the telecom boom of the late 1990s, in which optical fiber became overbuilt, fiber-owning companies engaged in transactions with each other that permitted them to report profits. If two companies own fiber, they just have an asset on their books. But if each buys capacity from the other, they can both report profits . . . so they did. In other cases, manufacturers loaned network operators money to buy equipment from them, before the operators had customers to justify the buildout. All this resulted in profits that were illusory. Nowadays, deals are being announced in which money appears to be round-tripped between AI players. People who believe there’s an AI bubble find it easy to view these transactions with suspicion. Is the purpose to achieve legitimate business goals or to exaggerate progress? Adding to worries, critics say, some of the deals that OpenAI has made with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others are oddly circular. OpenAI is set to receive billions from tech companies but also sends billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. . . . Nvidia has also made some deals that have raised questions about whether the company is paying itself. It announced that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips. . . . Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics also call circular deals. (The New York Times, November 20) Noteworthily, OpenAI has made investment commitments to industry counterparties totaling $1.4 trillion, even though it has yet to turn a profit. The company makes clear that the investments are to be paid out of revenues received from the same parties and that it has ways to back out of these commitments. But all this raises the question of whether the AI industry has developed a perpetual motion machine. (On this subject, I’ve been enjoying articles questioning the ability of people to relate to the word “trillion,” and I think this idea is spot on. A million dollars is a dollar a second for 11.6 days. A billion dollars is a dollar a second for 31.7 years. We get that. But a trillion dollars is a dollar a second for 31,700 years. Who can get their head around the significance of 31,700 years?) What will be the useful life of AI assets? We have to wonder whether the topic of obsolescence is being handled correctly in AI-land. What will be the lifespan of AI chips? How many years of earnings growth should be counted on in assigning p/e ratios for AI-related stocks? Will chips and other aspects of AI infrastructure last long enough to repay the debt undertaken to buy them? Will artificial general intelligence (a machine capable of doing anything the human brain can do) be achieved? Will that be the end of progress, or might there be further revolutions, and what firms will win them? Will firms reach a position where technology is stable and they can extract economic value from it? Or will new technologies continually threaten to supplant older ones as the route to success? In this connection, a single issue of an FT newsletter briefly mentioned two developments that suggest the fluid nature of the competitive landscape: A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI – the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. . . . Nvidia shares fell sharply yesterday on fears that Google is gaining ground in artificial intelligence, erasing $115bn in market value from the AI chipmaker. (FirstFT Americas, November 26) Dynamic change creates the opportunity for incredible new technologies, but that same dynamism can threaten the leading companies’ reign. Amid all these uncertainties, investors must ask whether the assumption of continued success incorporated in the prices they’re paying is fully warranted. Is exuberance leading to speculative behavior? For an extreme example, I’ll cite the trend toward venture capital investments in startups via $1 billion “seed rounds.” Here’s one vignette: Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we're doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’ ” (“The Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop,” Derek Thompson Substack, October 2) But that’s ancient history. . . already two months old. Here’s an update: Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, is in early talks to raise a new funding round at a roughly $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The startup was last valued at $12 billion in July, after it raised about $2 billion. (Reuters, November 13) And Thinking Machines Lab isn’t alone: In one of the boldest bets yet in the AI arms race, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the stealth startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion in a round that values the company at $32 billion – despite having no publicly released product or service. (CTech by Calcalist, April 13) What’s the end state? Part of the issue with AI includes the unusual nature of this newest thing. This isn’t like a business that designs and sells a product, making money if the selling price exceeds the cost of the inputs. Rather, it’s companies building an airplane while it’s in flight, and once it’s built, they’ll know what it can do and whether anyone will pay for its services. Many companies justify their spending because they’re not just building a product, they’re creating something that will change the world: artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. . . . The rub is that none of them quite know how to do it. But Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia, said the spending would all be justified if Silicon Valley reached its goal. He is optimistic it can be done. “It’s a bet on A.G.I. or bust,” Dr. Korinek said. (The New York Times, November 20 – emphasis added) The yet-to-be-determined nature of the industry under construction is best captured in remarks from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, that have been paraphrased as follows: “we’ll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.” This should be a source of pause for people who heretofore fully comprehended the nature of the businesses they invested in. Clearly, the value of a technology that equals or surpasses the human brain should be pretty big, but isn’t it well beyond calculation? A Word About the Use of Debt To date, much of the investment in AI and the supporting infrastructure has consisted of equity capital derived from operating cash flow. But now, companies are committing amounts that require debt financing, and for some of those companies, the investments and leverage have to be described as aggressive. The AI data centre boom was never going to be financed with cash alone. The project is too big to be paid for out of pocket. JPMorgan analysts have done some sums on the back of a napkin, or possibly a tablecloth, and estimated the bill for the infrastructure build-out would come to $5tn (not including a tip). Who knows if that’s right, but we have good reason to expect close to half a trillion in spending next year. Meanwhile, the biggest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Oracle) had only about $350bn in the bank, collectively, as of the end of the third quarter. (“Unhedged,” Financial Times, November 13) The firms mentioned above derive healthy cash flows from their very strong non-AI businesses. But the massive, winner-take-all arms race in AI is requiring some to take on debt. In fact, it’s reasonable to think one of the reasons they’re spending vast sums is to make it hard for lesser firms to keep up. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet have issued 30-year bonds to finance AI investments. In the case of the latter two, the yields on the bonds exceed those on Treasurys of like maturity by 100 basis points or less. Is it prudent to accept 30 years of technological uncertainty to make a fixed-income investment that yields little more than riskless debt? And will the investments funded with debt – in chips and data centers – maintain their level of productivity long enough for these 30-year obligations to be repaid? On November 14, Alex Kantrowitz’s Big Technology Podcast carried a conversation with Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at financial services firm D.A. Davidson, primarily regarding the use of debt in the AI sector. Here’s some of what Luria had to say: Healthy behavior is being practiced by “. . . reasonable, thoughtful business leaders, like the ones at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google that are making sound investments in growing the capacity to deliver AI. And the reason they can make sound investments is that they have all the customers. . . And so, when they make investments, they’re using cash on their balance sheets; they have tremendous cash flow to back it up; they understand that it’s a risky investment; and they balance it out.” Unhealthy behavior – Here he describes “. . . a startup that is borrowing money to build data centers for another startup. They’re both losing tremendous amounts of cash, and yet they’re somehow being able to raise this debt capital in order to fund this buildout, again without having the customers or the visibility into those investments paying off.” “So there’s a whole range of behaviors between healthy and unhealthy, and we just need to sort that out so we don’t make the mistakes of the past.” “There are certain things we finance through equity, through ownership, and there are certain things we finance through debt, through an obligation to pay down interest over time. And as a society, for the longest time, we’ve had those two pieces in their right place. Debt is when I have a predictable cash flow and/or an asset that can back that loan, and then it makes sense for me to exchange capital now for future cash flows to the lender. . . . We use equity for investing in more speculative things, for when we want to grow and we want to own that growth, but we’re not sure about what the cash flow is going to be. That’s how a normal economy functions. When you start confusing the two you get yourself in trouble.” Among potentially worrisome factors, Luria cites these: “A speculative asset . . . we don’t know how much of it we’re really going to need in two to five years.” Lender personnel with incentives to make loans but no exposure to long-term consequences The possibility that the supply of AI capacity catches up with or surpasses the demand The chance that future generations of AI chips will be more powerful, obsoleting existing ones or reducing their value as backing for debt Powerful competitors who vie for market share by cutting rental rates and running losses Here are some important paragraphs from Azeem Azhar’s Exponential View of October 18: When does an AI boom tip into a bubble? [Investor and engineer] Paul Kedrosky points to the Minsky moment – the inflection point when credit expansion exhausts its good projects and starts chasing bad ones, funding marginal deals with vendor financing and questionable coverage ratios. For AI infrastructure, that shift may already be underway; the telltale signs include hyperscalers’ capex outpacing revenue momentum and lenders sweetening terms to keep the party alive. Paul makes a compelling case. We’ve entered speculative finance territory – arguably past the tentative stage – and recent deals will set dangerous precedents. As Paul warns, this financing will “create templates for future such transactions,” spurring rapid expansion in junk issuance and SPV proliferation among hyperscalers chasing dominance at any cost. . . . For AI infrastructure, the warning signs are flashing: vendor financing proliferates, coverage ratios thin, and hyperscalers leverage balance sheets to maintain capex velocity even as revenue momentum lags. We see both sides – genuine infrastructure expansion alongside financing gymnastics that recall the 2000 telecom bust. The boom may yet prove productive, but only if revenue catches up before credit tightens. When does healthy strain become systemic risk? That’s the question we must answer before the market does. (Emphasis added) Azhar references the use of off-balance sheet financing via special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs, which were among the biggest contributors to Enron’s precariousness and eventual collapse. A company and its partners set up an SPV for some specific purpose(s) and supply the equity capital. The parent company may have operating control, but because it doesn’t have majority ownership, it doesn’t consolidate the SPV on its financial statements. The SPV takes on debt, but that debt doesn’t appear on the parent’s books. The parent may be an investment grade borrower, but likewise, the debt isn’t an obligation of the parent or guaranteed by it. Today’s debt may be backed by promised rent from a data center tenant – sometimes an equity partner – but the debt isn’t a direct obligation of the equity partner either. Essentially, an SPV is a way to make it look like a company isn’t doing the things the SPV is doing and doesn’t have the debt the SPV does. (Private equity funds and private credit funds are highly likely to be found among the partners and lenders in these entities.) As I quoted earlier, according to Perez (who wrote on the heels of the dot-com bubble), “what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments.” Early investment is lost in the “Minsky moment,” in which unwise commitments made in an extended up-cycle encounters value destruction in a correction. And there are three things we know for sure about the use of debt: it magnifies losses if there are losses (just as it magnifies the hoped-for gains if they materialize), it increases the probability of a venture failing if it encounters a difficult moment, and despite the layer of equity beneath it, it puts lenders’ capital at risk if the difficult moment is bad enough. One key risk to consider is the possibility that the boom in data center construction will result in a glut. Some data centers may be rendered uneconomic, and some owners may go bankrupt. In that case, a new generation of owners might buy up centers at pennies on the dollar from lenders who foreclosed on them, reaping profits when the industry stabilizes. This is a process through which “creative destruction” brings markets into equilibrium and reduces costs to levels that make future business profitable. Debt is neither a good thing nor a bad thing per se. Likewise, the use of leverage in the AI industry shouldn’t be applauded or feared. It all comes down to the proportion of debt in the capital structure; the quality of the assets or cash flows you’re lending against; the borrowers’ alternative sources of liquidity for repayment; and the adequacy of the safety margin obtained by lenders. We’ll see which lenders maintain discipline in today’s heady environment. It’s worth noting in this connection that Oaktree has made a few investments in data centers, and our parent, Brookfield, is raising a $10 billion fund for investment in AI infrastructure. Brookfield is putting up its own money and has equity commitments from sovereign wealth funds and Nvidia, to which it intends to apply “prudent” debt. Brookfield’s investments seem likely to go largely into geographies that are less saturated with data centers and for infrastructure to supply the vast amounts of electric power that data centers will require. Of course, we’re both doing these things on the basis of what we think are prudent decisions. I know I don’t know enough to opine on AI. But I do know something about debt, and it’s this: It’s okay to supply debt financing for a venture where the outcome is uncertain. It’s not okay where the outcome is purely a matter of conjecture. Those who understand the difference still have to make the distinction correctly. The FT’s Unhedged quotes Chong Sin, lead analyst for CMBS research at JPMorgan, as saying, “. . . in our conversations with investment grade ABS and CMBS investors, one often-cited concern is whether they want to take on the residual value risk of data centers when the bonds mature.” I’m glad potential lenders are asking the kind of questions they should. Here’s how to think about the intersection of debt and AI according to Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO and co-portfolio manager of our Opportunities Funds: Most technological advances develop into winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most competitions. The “right” way to play this dynamic is through equity, not debt. Assuming you can diversify your equity exposures so as to include the eventual winner, the massive gain from the winner will more than compensate for the capital impairment on the losers. That’s the venture capitalist’s time-honored formula for success. The precise opposite is true of a diversified pool of debt exposures. You’ll only make your coupon on the winner, and that will be grossly insufficient to compensate for the impairments you’ll experience on the debt of the losers. Of course, if you can’t identify the pool of companies from which the winner will emerge, the difference between debt and equity is irrelevant – you’re a zero either way. I mention this because that’s precisely what happened in search and social media: early leaders (Lycos in search and MySpace in social media) lost out spectacularly to companies that emerged later (Google in search and Facebook in social media). Trying to Get to a Conclusion There can be no doubt that today’s behavior is “speculative,” defined as based on speculation regarding the future. There’s also no doubt that no one knows what the future holds, but investors are betting huge sums on that future. In that connection, I want to say a little about the unique nature of AI. The AI revolution is different from the technological revolutions that preceded it in ways that are both wonderful and worrisome. It feels to me like a genie has been released from a bottle, and it isn’t going back in: AI may not be a tool for mankind, but rather something of a replacement. It may be capable of taking over cognition, on which humans have thus far had a monopoly. Because of this, it’s likely to be different in kind from prior developments, not just in degree. (More on this in my postscript.) AI technology is progressing at an incredibly rapid clip, possibly leaving scant time for mankind to adjust. I’ll provide two examples: Coding, which we called “computer programming” 60 years ago, is the canary in the coal mine in terms of the impact of AI. In many advanced software teams, developers no longer write the code; they type in what they want, and AI systems generate the code for them. Coding performed by AI is at a world-class level, something that wasn’t so just a year ago. According to my guide here, “There is no speculation about whether or not human replacement will take place in that vertical.” In the field of digital advertising, when users log into an app, AI engages in “ad matching,” showing them ads tailored to the preferences displayed by their prior surfing. No humans need apply to do this job. Perhaps most importantly, the growth of demand for AI seems totally unpredictable. As one of my younger advisers explained, “the speed and scale of improvement mean it’s incredibly hard to forecast demand for AI. Adoption today may have nothing to do with adoption tomorrow, because a year or two from now, AI may be able to do 10x or 100x what it can do today. Thus, how can anyone say how many data centers will be needed? And how can even successful companies know how much computing capacity to contract for?” With differences like these, how can anyone correctly judge what AI implies for the future? * * * One of the things occupying many observers at this juncture – including me – is the search for parallels to past bubbles. Here’s some historical perspective from a recent article in Wired: AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” [Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland] write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history – peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.” . . . In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. . . . It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event – a signal to investors to pour money into the industry. “Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.” As a result, the bubble burst in 1929 – from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932. . . . It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression. (“AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All,” Brian Merchant, Wired, October 27 – emphasis added. N.b., the Depression had many causes beyond the bursting of the radio/aviation bubble.) Derek Thompson, who supplied the quote with which I opened this memo, ended his newsletter with some terrific historical perspective: The railroads were a bubble and they transformed America. Electricity was a bubble, and it transformed America. The broadband build-out of the late-1990s was a bubble that transformed America. I am not rooting for a bubble, and quite the contrary, I hope that the US economy doesn’t experience another recession for many years. But given the amount of debt now flowing into AI data center construction, I think it’s unlikely that AI will be the first transformative technology that isn’t overbuilt and doesn’t incur a brief painful correction. (“AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself.” November 4 – emphasis added) The skeptics readily cite ways in which today’s events are comparable to the internet bubble: A change-the-world technology Exuberant, speculative behavior The role of FOMO Suspect, circular deals The use of SPVs $1 billion seed rounds The supporters have reasons why the comparison isn’t appropriate: An existing product for which there is strong demand One billion users already (many times the number of internet users at the height of the bubble) Well-established main players with revenues, profits, and cash flow The absence of an IPO craze with prices doubling in a day Reasonable p/e ratios for the established participants I’ll elaborate regarding the first of the proposed non-comparable factors. Unlike in the internet bubble, AI products already exist at scale, the demand for them is exploding, and they’re producing revenues in rapidly increasing amounts. For example, Anthropic, one of the two leaders in producing models for AI coding as described on page 12, is said to have “10x-ed” its revenues in each of the last two years (for those who didn’t study higher math, that’s 100x in two years). Revenues from Claude Code, a program for coding that Anthropic introduced earlier this year, already are said to be running at an annual rate of $1 billion. Revenues for the other leader, Cursor, were $1 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024, and they, too, are expected to reach $1 billion this year. As to the final bullet point, see the table below, which comes from Goldman Sachs via Derek Thompson. You’ll notice that during the internet bubble of 1998-2000, the p/e ratios were much higher for Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle than they are today for the biggest AI players – Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta (OpenAI doesn’t have earnings). In fact, Microsoft’s on a half-off sale relative to its p/e 26 years ago! In the first bubble I witnessed – surrounding the Nifty-Fifty in 1969-72 – the p/e ratios for the leading companies were even higher than those of 1998-2000. In Conclusion For my final citation, I’ll look to Sam Altman of OpenAI. His comments seem to me to capture the essence of what’s going on: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Mr. Altman told reporters this year. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about A.I.? My opinion is yes. Is A.I. the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” (The New York Times, November 20) But do I have a bottom line? Yes, I do. Alan Greenspan’s phrase, mentioned earlier, serves as an excellent way to sum up a stock market bubble: “irrational exuberance.” There is no doubt that investors are applying exuberance with regard to AI. The question is whether it’s irrational. Given the vast potential of AI but also the large number of enormous unknowns, I think virtually no one can say for sure. We can theorize about whether the current enthusiasm is excessive, but we won’t know until years from now whether it was. Bubbles are best identified in retrospect. While the parallels to past bubbles are inescapable, believers in the technology will argue that “this time it’s different.” Those four words are heard in virtually every bubble, explaining why the present situation isn’t a bubble, unlike the analogous prior ones. On the other hand, Sir John Templeton, who in 1987 drew my attention to those four words, was quick to point out that 20% of the time things really are different. But on the third hand, it must be borne in mind that behavior based on the belief that it’s different is what causes it to not be different! Today’s situation calls to mind a comment attributed to American economist Stuart Chase about faith. I believe it’s also applicable to AI (as well as to gold and cryptocurrencies): For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Here’s my actual bottom line: There’s a consistent history of transformational technologies generating excessive enthusiasm and investment, resulting in more infrastructure than is needed and asset prices that prove to have been too high. The excesses accelerate the adoption of the technology in a way that wouldn’t occur in their absence. The common word for these excesses is “bubbles.” AI has the potential to be one of the greatest transformational technologies of all time. As I wrote just above, AI is currently the subject of great enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm doesn’t produce a bubble conforming to the historical pattern, that will be a first. Bubbles created in this process usually end in losses for those who fuel them. The losses stem largely from the fact that the technology’s newness renders the extent and timing of its impact unpredictable. This in turn makes it easy to judge companies too positively amid all the enthusiasm and difficult to know which will emerge as winners when the dust settles. There can be no way to participate fully in the potential benefits from the new technology without being exposed to the losses that will arise if the enthusiasm and thus investors’ behavior prove to have been excessive. The use of debt in this process – which the high level of uncertainty usually precluded in past technological revolutions – has the potential to magnify all of the above this time. Since no one can say definitively whether this is a bubble, I’d advise that no one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. But by the same token, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position, applied with selectivity and prudence, seems like the best approach. Finally, it’s essential to bear in mind that there are no magic words in investing. These days, people promoting real estate funds say, “Office buildings are so yesterday, but we’re investing in the future through data centers,” whereupon everyone nods in agreement. But data centers can be in shortage or in oversupply, and rental rates can surprise to the upside or the downside. As a result, they can be profitable . . . or not. Intelligent investment in data centers, and thus in AI – like everything else – requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation. December 9, 2025 P.S.: The following has nothing to do with the financial markets or the question of whether AI is the subject of a bubble. My topic is the impact of AI on society through joblessness and purposelessness. You needn’t read it – that’s why it’s a postscript – but it’s important to me, and I've been looking for a place to say a few words about it. On November 18, a research note from Barclays described Fed Governor Christopher Waller as having “highlighted how recent stock market enthusiasm around AI has not yet translated into job creation.” This strikes me as paradoxical given my sense that one of AI’s main impacts will be to increase productivity and thus eliminate jobs. That is the source of my concern. I view AI primarily as an incredible labor-saving device. Joe Davis, Global Chief Economist and Global Head of the Investment Strategy Group at Vanguard, says, “for most jobs – likely four out of five – AI’s impact will result in a mixture of innovation and automation, and could save about 43% of the time people currently spend on their work tasks.” (Exponential View, September 3) I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can’t find jobs because of it. The optimists argue that “new jobs have always materialized after past technological advances.” I hope that’ll hold true in the case of AI, but hope isn’t much to hang one’s hat on, and I have trouble figuring out where those jobs will come from. Of course, I’m not much of a futurist or a financial optimist, and that’s why it’s a good thing I shifted from equities to bonds in 1978. The other thing the optimists say is that “the beneficial impact of AI on productivity will cause a huge acceleration in GDP growth.” Here I have specific quibbles: The change in GDP can be thought of as the change in hours worked times the change in output per hour (aka “productivity”). The role of AI in increasing productivity means it will take fewer hours worked – meaning fewer workers – to produce the goods we need. Or, viewed from the other direction, maybe the boom in productivity will mean a lot more goods can be produced with the same amount of labor. But if a lot of jobs are lost to AI, how will people be able to afford the additional goods AI enables to be produced? I find it hard to imagine a world in which AI works shoulder-to-shoulder with all the people who are employed today. How can employment not decline? AI is likely to replace large numbers of entry-level workers, people who process paper without applying judgment, and junior lawyers who scour the lawbooks for precedents. Maybe even junior investment analysts who create spreadsheets and compile presentation materials. It’s said that AI can read an MRI better than the average doctor. Driving is one of the most populous professions in America, and driverless vehicles are already arriving; where will all the people who currently drive taxis, limos, buses, and trucks find jobs? I imagine government’s response will be something called “universal basic income.” The government will simply mail checks to the millions for whom there are no jobs. But the worrier in me finds problems in this, too: Where will the money come from for those checks? The job losses I foresee imply reduced income tax receipts and increased spending on entitlements. This puts a further burden on the declining segment of the population that is working and implies even greater deficits ahead. In this new world, will governments be able to fund ever-increasing deficits? And more importantly, people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck. A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect, and presents them with challenges, the overcoming of which provides satisfaction. How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day. I worry about the correlation between the loss of jobs in mining and manufacturing in recent decades and the incidence of opioid addiction and shortening of lifespans. And by the way, if we eliminate large numbers of junior lawyers, analysts, and doctors, where will we get the experienced veterans capable of solving serious problems requiring judgment and pattern recognition honed over decades? What jobs won’t be eliminated? What careers should our children and grandchildren prepare for? Think about the jobs that machines can’t perform. My list starts with plumbers, electricians, and masseurs –physical tasks. Maybe nurses will earn more than doctors because they deliver hands-on care. And what distinguishes the best artists, athletes, doctors, lawyers, and hopefully investors? I think it’s something called talent or insight, which AI might or might not be able to replicate. But how many people at the top of those professions are needed? A past presidential candidate said he would give laptops to everyone who lost their job to offshoring. How many laptop operators do we need? Finally, I’m concerned that a small number of highly educated multi-billionaires living on the coasts will be viewed as having created technology that puts millions out of work. This promises even more social and political division than we have now, making the world ripe for populist demagoguery. I’ve seen incredible progress over the course of my lifetime, but in many ways I miss the simpler world I grew up in. I worry that this will be another big one. I get no pleasure from this recitation. Will the optimists please explain why I’m wrong? Interestingly in this connection, Vanguard’s Joe Davis points out that more Americans are turning 65 in 2025 than in any preceding year, and that approximately 16 million baby boomers will retire between now and 2035. Could AI merely make up for that? There’s an optimistic take for you.

Title: Is It a Bubble? By Howard Marks

Time Published: 2025-12-10T17:30:43Z
Full Content:
Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. During my visits to clients in Asia and the Middle East last month, I was often asked about the possibility of a bubble surrounding artificial intelligence, and my discussions gave rise to this memo. I want to start off with my usual caveats: I’m not active in the stock market; I merely watch it as the best barometer of investor psychology. I’m also no techie, and I don’t know any more about AI than most generalist investors. But I’ll do my best. One of the most interesting aspects of bubbles is their regularity, not in terms of timing, but rather the progression they follow. Something new and seemingly revolutionary appears and worms its way into people’s minds. It captures their imagination, and the excitement is overwhelming. The early participants enjoy huge gains. Those who merely look on feel incredible envy and regret and – motivated by the fear of continuing to miss out – pile in. They do this without knowledge of what the future will bring or concern about whether the price they’re paying can possibly be expected to produce a reasonable return with a tolerable amount of risk. The end result for investors is inevitably painful in the short to medium term, although it’s possible to end up ahead after enough years have passed. I’ve lived through several bubbles and read about others, and they’ve all hewed to this description. One might think the losses experienced when past bubbles popped would discourage the next one from forming. But that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m sure it never will. Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that “everyone knows” will change the world. I took the quote that opens this memo from Derek Thompson’s November 4 newsletter entitled “AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself,” about parallels between what’s going on today in AI and the railroad boom of the 1860s. Its word-for-word applicability to both shows clearly what’s meant by the phrase widely attributed to Mark Twain: “history rhymes.” Understanding Bubbles Before diving into the subject at hand – and having read a great deal about it in preparation – I want to start with a point of clarification. Everyone asks, “Is there a bubble in AI?” I think there’s ambiguity even in the question. I’ve concluded there are two different but interrelated bubble possibilities to think about: one in the behavior of companies within the industry, and the other in how investors are behaving with regard to the industry. I have absolutely no ability to judge whether the AI companies’ aggressive behavior is justified, so I’ll try to stick primarily to the question of whether there’s a bubble around AI in the financial world. The main job of an investment analyst – especially in the so-called “value” school to which I subscribe – is to (a) study companies and other assets and assess the level of and outlook for their intrinsic value and (b) make investment decisions on the basis of that value. Most of the change the analyst encounters in the short to medium term surrounds the asset’s price and its relationship to underlying value. That relationship, in turn, is essentially the result of investor psychology. Market bubbles aren’t caused directly by technological or financial developments. Rather, they result from the application of excessive optimism to those developments. As I wrote in my January memo On Bubble Watch, bubbles are temporary manias in which developments in those areas become the subject of what former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called “irrational exuberance.’’ Bubbles usually coalesce around new financial developments (e.g., the South Sea Company of the early 1700s or sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities in 2005-06) or technological progress (optical fiber in the late 1990s and the internet in 1998-2000). Newness plays a huge part in this. Because there’s no history to restrain the imagination, the future can appear limitless for the new thing. And futures that are perceived to be limitless can justify valuations that go well beyond past norms – leading to asset prices that aren’t justified on the basis of predictable earning power. The role of newness is well described in my favorite passage from a book that greatly influenced me, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith wrote about what he called “the extreme brevity of the financial memory” and pointed out that in the financial markets, “past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” In other words, history can impose limits on awe regarding the present and imagination regarding the future. In the absence of history, on the other hand, all things seem possible. The key thing to note here is that the new thing understandably inspires great enthusiasm, but bubbles are what happen when the enthusiasm reaches irrational proportions. Who can identify the boundary of rationality? Who can say when an optimistic market has become a bubble? It’s just a matter of judgment. Something that occurred to me this past month is that two of my best “calls” came in 2000, when I cautioned about what was going on in the market for tech and internet stocks, and in 2005-07, when I cited the dearth of risk aversion and the resulting ease of doing crazy deals in the pre-Global Financial Crisis world. First, in neither case did I possess any expertise regarding the things that turned out to be the subjects of the bubbles: the internet and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. All I did was render observations regarding the behavior taking place around me. And second, the value in my calls consisted mostly of describing the folly in that behavior, not in insisting that it had brought on a bubble. Struggling with whether to apply the “bubble” label can bog you down and interfere with proper judgment; we can accomplish a great deal by merely assessing what’s going on around us and drawing inferences with regard to proper behavior. What’s Good About Bubbles? Before going on to discuss AI and whether it’s presently in a bubble, I want to spend a little time on a subject that may seem somewhat academic from the standpoint of investors: the upside of bubbles. You may find the attention I devote to this topic excessive, but I do so because I find it fascinating. The November 5 Stratechery newsletter was entitled “The Benefits of Bubbles.” In it, Ben Thompson (no relation to Derek) cites a book titled Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation. It was written by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, who propose that there are two kinds of bubbles: . . . “Inflection Bubbles” – the good kind of bubbles, as opposed to the much more damaging “Mean-reversion Bubbles” like the 2000’s subprime mortgage bubble. I find this a useful dichotomy. The financial fads I’ve read about or witnessed – the South Sea Company, portfolio insurance, and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities – stirred the imagination based on the promise of returns without risk, but there was no expectation that they would represent overall progress for mankind. There was, for example, no thought that housing would be revolutionized by the sub-prime mortgage movement, merely a feeling that there was money to be made from backing new buyers. Hobart and Huber call these “mean-reverting bubbles,” presumably because there’s no expectation that the underlying developments would move the world forward. Fads merely rise and fall. On the other hand, Hobart and Huber call bubbles based on technological progress – as in the case of the railroads and the internet – “inflection bubbles.” After an inflection-driven bubble, the world will not revert to its prior state. In such a bubble, “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.” As Thompson tells us: The definitive book on bubbles has long been Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. Bubbles were – are – thought to be something negative and to be avoided, particularly at the time Perez published her book. The year was 2002 and much of the world was in a recession coming off the puncturing of the dot-com bubble. Perez didn’t deny the pain: in fact, she noted that similar crashes marked previous revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution, railways, electricity, and the automobile. In each case the bubbles were not regrettable, but necessary: the speculative mania enabled what Perez called the “Installation Phase,” where necessary but not necessarily financially wise investments laid the groundwork for the “Deployment Period.” What marked the shift to the deployment period was the popping of the bubble; what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments. (All emphasis added) This distinction is very meaningful for Hobart and Huber, and I agree. They say, “not all bubbles destroy wealth and value. Some can be understood as important catalysts for techno-scientific progress.” But I would restate as follows: “Mean-reversion bubbles” – in which markets soar on the basis of some new financial miracle and then collapse – destroy wealth. On the other hand, “inflection bubbles” based on revolutionary developments accelerate technological progress and create the foundation for a more prosperous future, and they destroy wealth. The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress. Hobart and Huber go on to describe in greater depth the process through which bubbles finance the building of the infrastructure required by the new technology and thus accelerate its adoption: Most novel technology doesn’t just appear ex nihilo [i.e., from nothing], entering the world fully formed and all at once. Rather, it builds on previous false starts, failures, iterations, and historical path dependencies. Bubbles create opportunities to deploy the capital necessary to fund and speed up such large-scale experimentation – which includes lots of trial and error done in parallel – thereby accelerating the rate of potentially disruptive technologies and breakthroughs. By generating positive feedback cycles of enthusiasm and investment, bubbles can be net beneficial. Optimism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Speculation provides the massive financing needed to fund highly risky and exploratory projects; what appears in the short term to be excessive enthusiasm or just bad investing turns out to be essential for bootstrapping social and technological innovations . . . A bubble can be a collective delusion, but it can also be an expression of collective vision. That vision becomes a site of coordination for people and capital and for the parallelization of innovation. Instead of happening over time, bursts of progress happen simultaneously across different domains. And with mounting enthusiasm . . . comes increased risk tolerance and strong network effects. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, attracts even more participants, entrepreneurs, and speculators, further reinforcing this positive feedback loop. Like bubbles, FOMO tends to have a bad reputation, but it’s sometimes a healthy instinct. After all, none of us wants to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build the future. In other words, bubbles based on technological progress are good because they excite investors into pouring in money – a good bit of which is thrown away – to carpet-bomb a new area of opportunity and thus jump-start its exploitation. The key realization seems to be that if people remained patient, prudent, analytical, and value-insistent, novel technologies would take many years and perhaps decades to be built out. Instead, the hysteria of the bubble causes the process to be compressed into a very short period – with some of the money going into life-changing investment in the winners but a lot of it being incinerated. A bubble has aspects that are both technological and financial, but the above citations are from the standpoint of people who crave technological progress and are perfectly happy to see investors lose money in its interest. “We,” on the other hand, would like to see technological progress but have no desire to throw away money to help bring it about. Ben Thompson ends this discussion by saying, “This is why I’m excited to talk about new technologies, the prospect for which I don’t know.” I love the fact that he’s excited by future possibilities and at the same time admits that the shape of the future is unknown (in our world, we might say “very risky”). Assessing the Current Landscape Now let’s get down to what we used to call “brass tacks.” What do we know? First, I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t believe artificial intelligence has the potential to be one of the biggest technological developments of all time, reshaping both daily life and the global economy. We also know that in recent years, economies and markets have become increasingly dependent on AI: AI is responsible for a very large portion of companies’ total capital expenditures. Capital expenditures on AI capacity account for a large share of the growth in U.S. GDP. AI stocks have been the source of the vast majority of the gains of the S&P 500. As a Fortune headline put it on October 7: 75% of gains, 80% of profits, 90% of capex – AI’s grip on the S&P is total and Morgan Stanley’s top analyst is ‘very concerned’ Further, I think it’s important to note that whereas the gains in AI-related stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of the total gains in all stocks, the excitement AI injects into the market must have added a lot to the appreciation of non-AI stocks as well. AI-related stocks have shown astronomical performance, led by Nvidia, the leading developer of computer chips for AI. From its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1999, when its estimated market value was $626 million, Nvidia briefly became the world’s first company worth $5 trillion. That’s appreciation of around 8,000x, or roughly 40% a year for 26+ years. No wonder imaginations have been fired. What Are the Areas of Uncertainty? I think it’s fair to say that while we know AI will be a source of incredible change, most of us have no idea exactly what it will be able to do, how it will be applied commercially, or what the timing will be. Who will be the winners, and what will they be worth? If a new technology is assumed to be a world changer, it’s invariably assumed that the leading companies possessing that technology will be of great value. But how accurate will that assumption prove to be? As Warren Buffett pointed out in 1999, “[The automobile was] the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the 20th century. . . . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. So autos had an enormous impact on America but the opposite direction on investors.” (Time, January 23, 2012) In AI, there are some very strong leaders at present, including some of the world’s strongest and richest companies. But new technology is notoriously disruptive. Will today’s leaders prevail or give way to upstarts? How much will the arms race cost, and who will win? Similarly, what’s a share in an upstart worth? Unlike front runners worth trillions, it’s possible to invest in some would-be challengers at enterprise values in mere billions or even – might I say? – millions. On June 25, 2024, CNBC reported as follows: A team founded by college dropouts has raised $120 million from investors led by Primary Venture Partners to build a new AI chip to take on Nvidia. Etched CEO Gavin Uberti said the startup is betting that as AI develops, most of the technology’s power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. “If transformers go away, we’ll die,” Uberti told CNBC. “But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time.” Even granting the possibility that Etched won’t become the biggest company of all time, if success could give them a valuation just one-fifth of Nvidia’s peak – a mere $1 trillion – what probability of success would be required to justify an investment of $120 million? Assuming for simplicity’s sake that the investment was for a 100% ownership stake, all you need is a belief that achieving the trillion-dollar value has a probability of one-tenth of a percent for an expected return of over eight times your money. Who’s to say Etched doesn’t have that chance? And in that case, why would anyone not play? The foregoing is what I call “lottery-ticket thinking,” in which the dream of an enormous payoff justifies – no, compels – participation in an endeavor with an overwhelming probability of failing. There’s nothing wrong with calculating expected values this way. Leading venture capitalists engage in it every day to great effect. But assumptions regarding the possible payoffs and their probabilities must be reasonable. Thinking about a trillion-dollar payout will override reasonableness in any calculation. Will AI produce profits, and for whom? Two things we know little or nothing about are the profits AI will produce for vendors and its impact on non-AI companies, primarily meaning those who employ it. Will AI be a monopoly or duopoly, in which one or two leading companies are able to charge dearly for the capabilities? Or will it be a highly competitive free-for-all in which a number of firms compete on price for users’ spending on AI services, making it a commodity? Or, perhaps most likely, will it be a mix of leading companies and specialized players, some of whom compete on price and others through proprietary advantages. It’s said that the services currently responding to AI queries, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, lose money on every query they answer (of course, it’s not unusual for participants in a new industry to offer “loss leaders” for a while). Will the leading tech firms – used to success in winner-take-all markets – be content to experience losses in their AI businesses for years in order to gain share? Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to the race for AI leadership. Who will win, and what will be the result? Likewise, what will be AI’s impact on the companies that use it? Clearly, AI will be a great tool for enhancing users’ productivity by, among other things, replacing workers with computer-sourced labor and intelligence. But will this ability to cut costs add to the profit margins of the companies that employ it? Or will it simply enable price wars among those companies in the pursuit of customers? In that case, the savings might be passed on to the customers rather than garnered by the companies. In other words, is it possible AI will increase the efficiency of businesses without increasing their profitability? Should we worry about so-called “circular deals”? In the telecom boom of the late 1990s, in which optical fiber became overbuilt, fiber-owning companies engaged in transactions with each other that permitted them to report profits. If two companies own fiber, they just have an asset on their books. But if each buys capacity from the other, they can both report profits . . . so they did. In other cases, manufacturers loaned network operators money to buy equipment from them, before the operators had customers to justify the buildout. All this resulted in profits that were illusory. Nowadays, deals are being announced in which money appears to be round-tripped between AI players. People who believe there’s an AI bubble find it easy to view these transactions with suspicion. Is the purpose to achieve legitimate business goals or to exaggerate progress? Adding to worries, critics say, some of the deals that OpenAI has made with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others are oddly circular. OpenAI is set to receive billions from tech companies but also sends billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. . . . Nvidia has also made some deals that have raised questions about whether the company is paying itself. It announced that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips. . . . Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics also call circular deals. (The New York Times, November 20) Noteworthily, OpenAI has made investment commitments to industry counterparties totaling $1.4 trillion, even though it has yet to turn a profit. The company makes clear that the investments are to be paid out of revenues received from the same parties and that it has ways to back out of these commitments. But all this raises the question of whether the AI industry has developed a perpetual motion machine. (On this subject, I’ve been enjoying articles questioning the ability of people to relate to the word “trillion,” and I think this idea is spot on. A million dollars is a dollar a second for 11.6 days. A billion dollars is a dollar a second for 31.7 years. We get that. But a trillion dollars is a dollar a second for 31,700 years. Who can get their head around the significance of 31,700 years?) What will be the useful life of AI assets? We have to wonder whether the topic of obsolescence is being handled correctly in AI-land. What will be the lifespan of AI chips? How many years of earnings growth should be counted on in assigning p/e ratios for AI-related stocks? Will chips and other aspects of AI infrastructure last long enough to repay the debt undertaken to buy them? Will artificial general intelligence (a machine capable of doing anything the human brain can do) be achieved? Will that be the end of progress, or might there be further revolutions, and what firms will win them? Will firms reach a position where technology is stable and they can extract economic value from it? Or will new technologies continually threaten to supplant older ones as the route to success? In this connection, a single issue of an FT newsletter briefly mentioned two developments that suggest the fluid nature of the competitive landscape: A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI – the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. . . . Nvidia shares fell sharply yesterday on fears that Google is gaining ground in artificial intelligence, erasing $115bn in market value from the AI chipmaker. (FirstFT Americas, November 26) Dynamic change creates the opportunity for incredible new technologies, but that same dynamism can threaten the leading companies’ reign. Amid all these uncertainties, investors must ask whether the assumption of continued success incorporated in the prices they’re paying is fully warranted. Is exuberance leading to speculative behavior? For an extreme example, I’ll cite the trend toward venture capital investments in startups via $1 billion “seed rounds.” Here’s one vignette: Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we're doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’ ” (“The Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop,” Derek Thompson Substack, October 2) But that’s ancient history. . . already two months old. Here’s an update: Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, is in early talks to raise a new funding round at a roughly $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The startup was last valued at $12 billion in July, after it raised about $2 billion. (Reuters, November 13) And Thinking Machines Lab isn’t alone: In one of the boldest bets yet in the AI arms race, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the stealth startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion in a round that values the company at $32 billion – despite having no publicly released product or service. (CTech by Calcalist, April 13) What’s the end state? Part of the issue with AI includes the unusual nature of this newest thing. This isn’t like a business that designs and sells a product, making money if the selling price exceeds the cost of the inputs. Rather, it’s companies building an airplane while it’s in flight, and once it’s built, they’ll know what it can do and whether anyone will pay for its services. Many companies justify their spending because they’re not just building a product, they’re creating something that will change the world: artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. . . . The rub is that none of them quite know how to do it. But Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia, said the spending would all be justified if Silicon Valley reached its goal. He is optimistic it can be done. “It’s a bet on A.G.I. or bust,” Dr. Korinek said. (The New York Times, November 20 – emphasis added) The yet-to-be-determined nature of the industry under construction is best captured in remarks from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, that have been paraphrased as follows: “we’ll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.” This should be a source of pause for people who heretofore fully comprehended the nature of the businesses they invested in. Clearly, the value of a technology that equals or surpasses the human brain should be pretty big, but isn’t it well beyond calculation? A Word About the Use of Debt To date, much of the investment in AI and the supporting infrastructure has consisted of equity capital derived from operating cash flow. But now, companies are committing amounts that require debt financing, and for some of those companies, the investments and leverage have to be described as aggressive. The AI data centre boom was never going to be financed with cash alone. The project is too big to be paid for out of pocket. JPMorgan analysts have done some sums on the back of a napkin, or possibly a tablecloth, and estimated the bill for the infrastructure build-out would come to $5tn (not including a tip). Who knows if that’s right, but we have good reason to expect close to half a trillion in spending next year. Meanwhile, the biggest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Oracle) had only about $350bn in the bank, collectively, as of the end of the third quarter. (“Unhedged,” Financial Times, November 13) The firms mentioned above derive healthy cash flows from their very strong non-AI businesses. But the massive, winner-take-all arms race in AI is requiring some to take on debt. In fact, it’s reasonable to think one of the reasons they’re spending vast sums is to make it hard for lesser firms to keep up. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet have issued 30-year bonds to finance AI investments. In the case of the latter two, the yields on the bonds exceed those on Treasurys of like maturity by 100 basis points or less. Is it prudent to accept 30 years of technological uncertainty to make a fixed-income investment that yields little more than riskless debt? And will the investments funded with debt – in chips and data centers – maintain their level of productivity long enough for these 30-year obligations to be repaid? On November 14, Alex Kantrowitz’s Big Technology Podcast carried a conversation with Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at financial services firm D.A. Davidson, primarily regarding the use of debt in the AI sector. Here’s some of what Luria had to say: Healthy behavior is being practiced by “. . . reasonable, thoughtful business leaders, like the ones at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google that are making sound investments in growing the capacity to deliver AI. And the reason they can make sound investments is that they have all the customers. . . And so, when they make investments, they’re using cash on their balance sheets; they have tremendous cash flow to back it up; they understand that it’s a risky investment; and they balance it out.” Unhealthy behavior – Here he describes “. . . a startup that is borrowing money to build data centers for another startup. They’re both losing tremendous amounts of cash, and yet they’re somehow being able to raise this debt capital in order to fund this buildout, again without having the customers or the visibility into those investments paying off.” “So there’s a whole range of behaviors between healthy and unhealthy, and we just need to sort that out so we don’t make the mistakes of the past.” “There are certain things we finance through equity, through ownership, and there are certain things we finance through debt, through an obligation to pay down interest over time. And as a society, for the longest time, we’ve had those two pieces in their right place. Debt is when I have a predictable cash flow and/or an asset that can back that loan, and then it makes sense for me to exchange capital now for future cash flows to the lender. . . . We use equity for investing in more speculative things, for when we want to grow and we want to own that growth, but we’re not sure about what the cash flow is going to be. That’s how a normal economy functions. When you start confusing the two you get yourself in trouble.” Among potentially worrisome factors, Luria cites these: “A speculative asset . . . we don’t know how much of it we’re really going to need in two to five years.” Lender personnel with incentives to make loans but no exposure to long-term consequences The possibility that the supply of AI capacity catches up with or surpasses the demand The chance that future generations of AI chips will be more powerful, obsoleting existing ones or reducing their value as backing for debt Powerful competitors who vie for market share by cutting rental rates and running losses Here are some important paragraphs from Azeem Azhar’s Exponential View of October 18: When does an AI boom tip into a bubble? [Investor and engineer] Paul Kedrosky points to the Minsky moment – the inflection point when credit expansion exhausts its good projects and starts chasing bad ones, funding marginal deals with vendor financing and questionable coverage ratios. For AI infrastructure, that shift may already be underway; the telltale signs include hyperscalers’ capex outpacing revenue momentum and lenders sweetening terms to keep the party alive. Paul makes a compelling case. We’ve entered speculative finance territory – arguably past the tentative stage – and recent deals will set dangerous precedents. As Paul warns, this financing will “create templates for future such transactions,” spurring rapid expansion in junk issuance and SPV proliferation among hyperscalers chasing dominance at any cost. . . . For AI infrastructure, the warning signs are flashing: vendor financing proliferates, coverage ratios thin, and hyperscalers leverage balance sheets to maintain capex velocity even as revenue momentum lags. We see both sides – genuine infrastructure expansion alongside financing gymnastics that recall the 2000 telecom bust. The boom may yet prove productive, but only if revenue catches up before credit tightens. When does healthy strain become systemic risk? That’s the question we must answer before the market does. (Emphasis added) Azhar references the use of off-balance sheet financing via special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs, which were among the biggest contributors to Enron’s precariousness and eventual collapse. A company and its partners set up an SPV for some specific purpose(s) and supply the equity capital. The parent company may have operating control, but because it doesn’t have majority ownership, it doesn’t consolidate the SPV on its financial statements. The SPV takes on debt, but that debt doesn’t appear on the parent’s books. The parent may be an investment grade borrower, but likewise, the debt isn’t an obligation of the parent or guaranteed by it. Today’s debt may be backed by promised rent from a data center tenant – sometimes an equity partner – but the debt isn’t a direct obligation of the equity partner either. Essentially, an SPV is a way to make it look like a company isn’t doing the things the SPV is doing and doesn’t have the debt the SPV does. (Private equity funds and private credit funds are highly likely to be found among the partners and lenders in these entities.) As I quoted earlier, according to Perez (who wrote on the heels of the dot-com bubble), “what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments.” Early investment is lost in the “Minsky moment,” in which unwise commitments made in an extended up-cycle encounters value destruction in a correction. And there are three things we know for sure about the use of debt: it magnifies losses if there are losses (just as it magnifies the hoped-for gains if they materialize), it increases the probability of a venture failing if it encounters a difficult moment, and despite the layer of equity beneath it, it puts lenders’ capital at risk if the difficult moment is bad enough. One key risk to consider is the possibility that the boom in data center construction will result in a glut. Some data centers may be rendered uneconomic, and some owners may go bankrupt. In that case, a new generation of owners might buy up centers at pennies on the dollar from lenders who foreclosed on them, reaping profits when the industry stabilizes. This is a process through which “creative destruction” brings markets into equilibrium and reduces costs to levels that make future business profitable. Debt is neither a good thing nor a bad thing per se. Likewise, the use of leverage in the AI industry shouldn’t be applauded or feared. It all comes down to the proportion of debt in the capital structure; the quality of the assets or cash flows you’re lending against; the borrowers’ alternative sources of liquidity for repayment; and the adequacy of the safety margin obtained by lenders. We’ll see which lenders maintain discipline in today’s heady environment. It’s worth noting in this connection that Oaktree has made a few investments in data centers, and our parent, Brookfield, is raising a $10 billion fund for investment in AI infrastructure. Brookfield is putting up its own money and has equity commitments from sovereign wealth funds and Nvidia, to which it intends to apply “prudent” debt. Brookfield’s investments seem likely to go largely into geographies that are less saturated with data centers and for infrastructure to supply the vast amounts of electric power that data centers will require. Of course, we’re both doing these things on the basis of what we think are prudent decisions. I know I don’t know enough to opine on AI. But I do know something about debt, and it’s this: It’s okay to supply debt financing for a venture where the outcome is uncertain. It’s not okay where the outcome is purely a matter of conjecture. Those who understand the difference still have to make the distinction correctly. The FT’s Unhedged quotes Chong Sin, lead analyst for CMBS research at JPMorgan, as saying, “. . . in our conversations with investment grade ABS and CMBS investors, one often-cited concern is whether they want to take on the residual value risk of data centers when the bonds mature.” I’m glad potential lenders are asking the kind of questions they should. Here’s how to think about the intersection of debt and AI according to Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO and co-portfolio manager of our Opportunities Funds: Most technological advances develop into winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most competitions. The “right” way to play this dynamic is through equity, not debt. Assuming you can diversify your equity exposures so as to include the eventual winner, the massive gain from the winner will more than compensate for the capital impairment on the losers. That’s the venture capitalist’s time-honored formula for success. The precise opposite is true of a diversified pool of debt exposures. You’ll only make your coupon on the winner, and that will be grossly insufficient to compensate for the impairments you’ll experience on the debt of the losers. Of course, if you can’t identify the pool of companies from which the winner will emerge, the difference between debt and equity is irrelevant – you’re a zero either way. I mention this because that’s precisely what happened in search and social media: early leaders (Lycos in search and MySpace in social media) lost out spectacularly to companies that emerged later (Google in search and Facebook in social media). Trying to Get to a Conclusion There can be no doubt that today’s behavior is “speculative,” defined as based on speculation regarding the future. There’s also no doubt that no one knows what the future holds, but investors are betting huge sums on that future. In that connection, I want to say a little about the unique nature of AI. The AI revolution is different from the technological revolutions that preceded it in ways that are both wonderful and worrisome. It feels to me like a genie has been released from a bottle, and it isn’t going back in: AI may not be a tool for mankind, but rather something of a replacement. It may be capable of taking over cognition, on which humans have thus far had a monopoly. Because of this, it’s likely to be different in kind from prior developments, not just in degree. (More on this in my postscript.) AI technology is progressing at an incredibly rapid clip, possibly leaving scant time for mankind to adjust. I’ll provide two examples: Coding, which we called “computer programming” 60 years ago, is the canary in the coal mine in terms of the impact of AI. In many advanced software teams, developers no longer write the code; they type in what they want, and AI systems generate the code for them. Coding performed by AI is at a world-class level, something that wasn’t so just a year ago. According to my guide here, “There is no speculation about whether or not human replacement will take place in that vertical.” In the field of digital advertising, when users log into an app, AI engages in “ad matching,” showing them ads tailored to the preferences displayed by their prior surfing. No humans need apply to do this job. Perhaps most importantly, the growth of demand for AI seems totally unpredictable. As one of my younger advisers explained, “the speed and scale of improvement mean it’s incredibly hard to forecast demand for AI. Adoption today may have nothing to do with adoption tomorrow, because a year or two from now, AI may be able to do 10x or 100x what it can do today. Thus, how can anyone say how many data centers will be needed? And how can even successful companies know how much computing capacity to contract for?” With differences like these, how can anyone correctly judge what AI implies for the future? * * * One of the things occupying many observers at this juncture – including me – is the search for parallels to past bubbles. Here’s some historical perspective from a recent article in Wired: AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” [Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland] write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history – peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.” . . . In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. . . . It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event – a signal to investors to pour money into the industry. “Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.” As a result, the bubble burst in 1929 – from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932. . . . It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression. (“AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All,” Brian Merchant, Wired, October 27 – emphasis added. N.b., the Depression had many causes beyond the bursting of the radio/aviation bubble.) Derek Thompson, who supplied the quote with which I opened this memo, ended his newsletter with some terrific historical perspective: The railroads were a bubble and they transformed America. Electricity was a bubble, and it transformed America. The broadband build-out of the late-1990s was a bubble that transformed America. I am not rooting for a bubble, and quite the contrary, I hope that the US economy doesn’t experience another recession for many years. But given the amount of debt now flowing into AI data center construction, I think it’s unlikely that AI will be the first transformative technology that isn’t overbuilt and doesn’t incur a brief painful correction. (“AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself.” November 4 – emphasis added) The skeptics readily cite ways in which today’s events are comparable to the internet bubble: A change-the-world technology Exuberant, speculative behavior The role of FOMO Suspect, circular deals The use of SPVs $1 billion seed rounds The supporters have reasons why the comparison isn’t appropriate: An existing product for which there is strong demand One billion users already (many times the number of internet users at the height of the bubble) Well-established main players with revenues, profits, and cash flow The absence of an IPO craze with prices doubling in a day Reasonable p/e ratios for the established participants I’ll elaborate regarding the first of the proposed non-comparable factors. Unlike in the internet bubble, AI products already exist at scale, the demand for them is exploding, and they’re producing revenues in rapidly increasing amounts. For example, Anthropic, one of the two leaders in producing models for AI coding as described on page 12, is said to have “10x-ed” its revenues in each of the last two years (for those who didn’t study higher math, that’s 100x in two years). Revenues from Claude Code, a program for coding that Anthropic introduced earlier this year, already are said to be running at an annual rate of $1 billion. Revenues for the other leader, Cursor, were $1 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024, and they, too, are expected to reach $1 billion this year. As to the final bullet point, see the table below, which comes from Goldman Sachs via Derek Thompson. You’ll notice that during the internet bubble of 1998-2000, the p/e ratios were much higher for Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle than they are today for the biggest AI players – Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta (OpenAI doesn’t have earnings). In fact, Microsoft’s on a half-off sale relative to its p/e 26 years ago! In the first bubble I witnessed – surrounding the Nifty-Fifty in 1969-72 – the p/e ratios for the leading companies were even higher than those of 1998-2000. In Conclusion For my final citation, I’ll look to Sam Altman of OpenAI. His comments seem to me to capture the essence of what’s going on: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Mr. Altman told reporters this year. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about A.I.? My opinion is yes. Is A.I. the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” (The New York Times, November 20) But do I have a bottom line? Yes, I do. Alan Greenspan’s phrase, mentioned earlier, serves as an excellent way to sum up a stock market bubble: “irrational exuberance.” There is no doubt that investors are applying exuberance with regard to AI. The question is whether it’s irrational. Given the vast potential of AI but also the large number of enormous unknowns, I think virtually no one can say for sure. We can theorize about whether the current enthusiasm is excessive, but we won’t know until years from now whether it was. Bubbles are best identified in retrospect. While the parallels to past bubbles are inescapable, believers in the technology will argue that “this time it’s different.” Those four words are heard in virtually every bubble, explaining why the present situation isn’t a bubble, unlike the analogous prior ones. On the other hand, Sir John Templeton, who in 1987 drew my attention to those four words, was quick to point out that 20% of the time things really are different. But on the third hand, it must be borne in mind that behavior based on the belief that it’s different is what causes it to not be different! Today’s situation calls to mind a comment attributed to American economist Stuart Chase about faith. I believe it’s also applicable to AI (as well as to gold and cryptocurrencies): For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Here’s my actual bottom line: There’s a consistent history of transformational technologies generating excessive enthusiasm and investment, resulting in more infrastructure than is needed and asset prices that prove to have been too high. The excesses accelerate the adoption of the technology in a way that wouldn’t occur in their absence. The common word for these excesses is “bubbles.” AI has the potential to be one of the greatest transformational technologies of all time. As I wrote just above, AI is currently the subject of great enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm doesn’t produce a bubble conforming to the historical pattern, that will be a first. Bubbles created in this process usually end in losses for those who fuel them. The losses stem largely from the fact that the technology’s newness renders the extent and timing of its impact unpredictable. This in turn makes it easy to judge companies too positively amid all the enthusiasm and difficult to know which will emerge as winners when the dust settles. There can be no way to participate fully in the potential benefits from the new technology without being exposed to the losses that will arise if the enthusiasm and thus investors’ behavior prove to have been excessive. The use of debt in this process – which the high level of uncertainty usually precluded in past technological revolutions – has the potential to magnify all of the above this time. Since no one can say definitively whether this is a bubble, I’d advise that no one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. But by the same token, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position, applied with selectivity and prudence, seems like the best approach. Finally, it’s essential to bear in mind that there are no magic words in investing. These days, people promoting real estate funds say, “Office buildings are so yesterday, but we’re investing in the future through data centers,” whereupon everyone nods in agreement. But data centers can be in shortage or in oversupply, and rental rates can surprise to the upside or the downside. As a result, they can be profitable . . . or not. Intelligent investment in data centers, and thus in AI – like everything else – requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation. December 9, 2025 P.S.: The following has nothing to do with the financial markets or the question of whether AI is the subject of a bubble. My topic is the impact of AI on society through joblessness and purposelessness. You needn’t read it – that’s why it’s a postscript – but it’s important to me, and I've been looking for a place to say a few words about it. On November 18, a research note from Barclays described Fed Governor Christopher Waller as having “highlighted how recent stock market enthusiasm around AI has not yet translated into job creation.” This strikes me as paradoxical given my sense that one of AI’s main impacts will be to increase productivity and thus eliminate jobs. That is the source of my concern. I view AI primarily as an incredible labor-saving device. Joe Davis, Global Chief Economist and Global Head of the Investment Strategy Group at Vanguard, says, “for most jobs – likely four out of five – AI’s impact will result in a mixture of innovation and automation, and could save about 43% of the time people currently spend on their work tasks.” (Exponential View, September 3) I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can’t find jobs because of it. The optimists argue that “new jobs have always materialized after past technological advances.” I hope that’ll hold true in the case of AI, but hope isn’t much to hang one’s hat on, and I have trouble figuring out where those jobs will come from. Of course, I’m not much of a futurist or a financial optimist, and that’s why it’s a good thing I shifted from equities to bonds in 1978. The other thing the optimists say is that “the beneficial impact of AI on productivity will cause a huge acceleration in GDP growth.” Here I have specific quibbles: The change in GDP can be thought of as the change in hours worked times the change in output per hour (aka “productivity”). The role of AI in increasing productivity means it will take fewer hours worked – meaning fewer workers – to produce the goods we need. Or, viewed from the other direction, maybe the boom in productivity will mean a lot more goods can be produced with the same amount of labor. But if a lot of jobs are lost to AI, how will people be able to afford the additional goods AI enables to be produced? I find it hard to imagine a world in which AI works shoulder-to-shoulder with all the people who are employed today. How can employment not decline? AI is likely to replace large numbers of entry-level workers, people who process paper without applying judgment, and junior lawyers who scour the lawbooks for precedents. Maybe even junior investment analysts who create spreadsheets and compile presentation materials. It’s said that AI can read an MRI better than the average doctor. Driving is one of the most populous professions in America, and driverless vehicles are already arriving; where will all the people who currently drive taxis, limos, buses, and trucks find jobs? I imagine government’s response will be something called “universal basic income.” The government will simply mail checks to the millions for whom there are no jobs. But the worrier in me finds problems in this, too: Where will the money come from for those checks? The job losses I foresee imply reduced income tax receipts and increased spending on entitlements. This puts a further burden on the declining segment of the population that is working and implies even greater deficits ahead. In this new world, will governments be able to fund ever-increasing deficits? And more importantly, people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck. A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect, and presents them with challenges, the overcoming of which provides satisfaction. How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day. I worry about the correlation between the loss of jobs in mining and manufacturing in recent decades and the incidence of opioid addiction and shortening of lifespans. And by the way, if we eliminate large numbers of junior lawyers, analysts, and doctors, where will we get the experienced veterans capable of solving serious problems requiring judgment and pattern recognition honed over decades? What jobs won’t be eliminated? What careers should our children and grandchildren prepare for? Think about the jobs that machines can’t perform. My list starts with plumbers, electricians, and masseurs –physical tasks. Maybe nurses will earn more than doctors because they deliver hands-on care. And what distinguishes the best artists, athletes, doctors, lawyers, and hopefully investors? I think it’s something called talent or insight, which AI might or might not be able to replicate. But how many people at the top of those professions are needed? A past presidential candidate said he would give laptops to everyone who lost their job to offshoring. How many laptop operators do we need? Finally, I’m concerned that a small number of highly educated multi-billionaires living on the coasts will be viewed as having created technology that puts millions out of work. This promises even more social and political division than we have now, making the world ripe for populist demagoguery. I’ve seen incredible progress over the course of my lifetime, but in many ways I miss the simpler world I grew up in. I worry that this will be another big one. I get no pleasure from this recitation. Will the optimists please explain why I’m wrong? Interestingly in this connection, Vanguard’s Joe Davis points out that more Americans are turning 65 in 2025 than in any preceding year, and that approximately 16 million baby boomers will retire between now and 2035. Could AI merely make up for that? There’s an optimistic take for you.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Unity Software (NYSE: U) went public in September 2020 at $52 per share during the pandemic gaming boom. The company provides the engine behind thousands of mobile games and interactive 3D experiences. Its business splits into Create Solutions (development tools) and Grow Solutions (advertising and monetization platform). The stock peaked above $200 in late 2021 during metaverse hype, then crashed over 80% by 2024. Unity burned cash, posted widening losses, and alienated developers with a controversial runtime fee structure threatening to charge per game install. New CEO Matthew Bromberg canceled the unpopular fees in early 2024, raised subscription prices, and pivoted into AI-powered advertising with Unity Vector. The stock bottomed around $15 in early 2024 and has since tripled. Here’s what $1,000 invested at different points would be worth today at $49.47 per share: 1-Year Return (December 2024 to December 2025) Since IPO (September 2020 to December 2025) IPO investors remain underwater after five years. But 2024 buyers doubled their money in 12 months, crushing the S&P 500 by 100 percentage points. Unity’s Q3 2025 earnings on November 5 delivered a massive surprise. The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.20 per share against expectations of a $0.24 loss. Revenue of $471 million beat estimates, and management credited Unity Vector AI for driving 6% growth in the advertising segment. Free cash flow hit $151 million. Analysts expect $0.89 in earnings for fiscal 2025, turning the corner to profitability. Wedbush added Unity to its Best Ideas List in early December, citing undervaluation in the game engine and mobile ad markets. Simply Wall St estimated fair value at $55.77, suggesting 20% upside at current prices near $49. Unity’s profile includes high growth potential through AI-powered advertising, 74% gross margins, and a path to profitability. The company dominates mobile game development, Vector AI is working, and the stock trades at 11.7 times sales with a forward P/E of 105. However, Unity still posted a $127 million GAAP loss in Q3 despite adjusted profits. The stock has a beta above 2, meaning higher volatility than the market. Insider selling has been heavy, with directors unloading millions in shares. Competition from Epic’s Unreal Engine remains fierce, and geopolitical risk exists with significant operations in Israel. The turnaround appears real, the AI monetization story has legs, and the valuation isn’t insane relative to peers like Roblox (15.6 times sales, still unprofitable).

GE Vernova (GEV) shares surged to a record high Wednesday after the company boosted its financial targets and doubled its quarterly dividend. The stock was up over 13% near $707 in recent trading, leaving it on track to close at an all-time high. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The energy equipment manufacturer said during its investor day Tuesday that its 2025 sales are trending toward the higher end of its $36 billion to $37 billion forecast, and lifted its projections for free cash flow this year to $3.5 billion to $4 billion, up from $3 billion to $3.5 billion previously. The company said it expects to generate $41 billion to $42 billion in revenue next year, along with $4.5 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow, and hiked its long-term projections for revenue and free cash flow by 2028. GE Vernova's board also approved doubling its dividend to $0.50 per share and boosted its stock buyback plan to $10 billion from $6 billion previously. GE Vernova's stronger outlook could boost confidence in its business as an independent entity after the provider of energy equipment and former division of General Electric was spun off from the conglomerate last year. UBS analysts said the higher targets constituted a "very strong update," and that GE Vernova could be poised to beat its own forecasts given a "track record of overdelivering." William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients that they continue to see GE Vernova as "the leader in energy and power infrastructure, in our view the most important component to the AI theme." Oppenheimer analysts upgraded their rating of GE Vernova stock to "outperform" with a $855 price target, writing "the magnitude of the AI infrastructure buildout proving larger and lasting longer than we previously anticipated." With Wednesday's gains, GE Vernova stock has more than doubled in value in 2025.

Title: What does the Netflix deal mean for Warner Bros's games division?
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-does-the-netflix-deal-mean-for-warner-bross-games-division
Time Published: 2025-12-10T16:43:04Z

Industry experts on the future for studios like Avalanche, Netherrealm, and Rocksteady After a brutal 12 months marked by financial underperformance, studio closures, and reorganisation, a fresh shadow has fallen over Warner Bros. Games: the prospect of a new corporate owner. The division is included – as an afterthought – in the sale of Warner Bros. Discovery to Netflix, which was subsequently challenged by a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance. Both potential buyers are wooing shareholders, and whoever wins will require regulatory approval, so closure on the deal is months or years away. Whatever the outcome, there is widespread concern about the impact on Warner's games teams. The firm is the only major Hollywood mega-studio to have maintained a strong position in gaming. It owns a series of successful mobile games as well as the AAA studios Netherrealm, Avalanche, Rocksteady, and TT Games alongside support studios in the US and Canada. Warner's hits have included TT's Lego games, Rocksteady's Batman Arkham series, and the runaway success of Avalanche's Hogwarts Legacy, which has sold over 30 million units. Netflix, meanwhile, has yet to make a significant impact in games, despite years of trying. After a splashy but ultimately fruitless investment in AAA, and deciding against bidding for EA (as reported by Bloomberg), the company has refocused on casual, second-screen games, supported by licensing titles like GTA. Games head Alain Tascan, an industry veteran with long stints at Epic and Ubisoft, has committed to titles that "use the phone as a controller," with a focus on multiplayer, kids, narrative, and mass appeal, as well as an eye on the social layer that Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft deliver. The company has cancelled unannounced publishing deals with external studios, sources have told GamesIndustry.biz. In public, it shut down the developer of its successful Squid Game mobile title and sold internal team Spry Fox back to its founders. The company is also planning to borrow $59 billion to pay for Warner, one of the largest such loans yet granted, and will be looking at asset sales to bring that figure down post-completion. On the face of it, the prospects for Warner's game division under Paramount look brighter. Newly added subsidiary Skydance has published a series of VR titles under the leadership of David Ellison, who now leads Paramount Skydance, and the company has a long history of licensing its IP for games, from Nickelodeon through to South Park and Star Trek. And it says it wants to do more. "During the merger with Skydance, Paramount identified games as a potential area of development and growth for the company," points out Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis. "David Ellison has greenlit, maintained and shipped Triple A scale multiple games at Skydance," says Symbol Zero's Rafael Brown. "Netflix hasn't greenlit and maintained, and shipped, a game budget of more than $5 million for any project thus far. The closest would have been Team Blue's Triple A game, which was cancelled. Netflix has zero history in funding and supporting Triple A games successfully." The optimistic view is that Netflix will reconsider this approach post-acquisition. Blue Moons' Richard Browne, who served as VP of Universal's game group before executive roles at THQ and Digital Extremes, is bullish. "I don't think they cease publishing AAA games," he says. "With Warner Bros. recently restructuring to support the core business, much as we did at Universal back in the early 2000s, it's now better positioned to deliver transmedia in a more coherent way. Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games, Alain Tascan will be able to harness and direct it accordingly." "Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games." "WB Games is a collection of some of the top game studios in the world," says Cassia Curran of the Curran Games Agency, "and they specialise in taking existing IP and translating them into fantastic, high quality games. Netflix could pump up the value of their premium subscription tier by allowing access to these games, and greatly deepen fan engagement and the value of the IP they own outright, such as KPop Demon Hunters, with top-tier AAA games made by the studios at WB Games." "This is a big opportunity for Netflix to recalibrate and double down on games," agrees Hendrik Lesser, president of the European Games Developer Federation. "The mix of great studios, great IP and Netflix's reach is one of a kind." Others go further. Far from being an afterthought, game studios should be a key plank in Netflix's ongoing growth, argues Lirui Ding of the games venture capital firm Transcend Fund. "What they're acquiring isn't just IP, but a studio system that's already proven it can translate world-class franchises into hit games," he says. "That matters because in gaming and entertainment more broadly, content is where durable value accrues. We have definitely seen this in the Transcend portfolio. Technology, tools, and platforms evolve, but gaming hits extend IP lifecycles, deepen engagement, and compound value across media. If handled correctly, games can reinforce the entire franchise ecosystem." The pessimistic view is that this heralds another round of industry downsizing from a company that has bought a business it doesn't need. "I believe Netflix will initially leave studios alone for the first six to 12 months and then start making cuts," says Brown, "and then gradually dismantle all of WB Games due to not wanting the financial outlay of AAA games that they did not purchase WB for." Many see Paramount as a less disruptive prospect. "Skydance is likely to value these game studios much more highly," says Curran. "It's had significant success with VR games like The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and WB Games studios make similar games to their Amy Hennig-led Skydance New Media team, which is releasing Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra next year, so they would fold in with each other easily. A Skydance acquisition would probably end up being business as usual for the WB Games studios." Harding-Rolls agrees. "I think the WB Games status quo is more likely to come from a Paramount acquisition rather than Netflix," he says. "I would expect Netflix to make more changes including potentially scaling down the number of studios." Any such divestment would require willing buyers, which have been thin on the ground in recent years. "Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Embracer, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Tencent, Netease, Krafton, and Nexon are all not in the space for buying right now," says Brown. "The game industry is retrenching and everyone is shedding studios and projects." Others are more optimistic. "I think there would be some buyers for select studios," says Harding-Rolls, "but the deal appetite for AAA studios remains quite soft due to the investment needed and the risks involved. The obvious candidates would be Savvy Games, EA (via the Saudi Public Investment Fund), and the console companies." Investors see value, too. "I think you'd actually find a healthy buyer universe for WB's marquee assets such as NetherRealm and Avalanche Software," says Joe Yuan, Investment Director at Hiro Capital. "The Korean strategics including Krafton, Nexon, and Smilegate are quite active in today's market, and private equity has emerged as a new buyer category and are looking for established, scaled assets that they can use as an anchor to pull in other acquisitions." Yuan can also see an outcome where the studios could go solo. "We are seeing more and more management buyouts emerge, so I think that may be a viable path for some of these teams to control their destiny a bit more and have more financial upside," he says. Arc Games, Saber Interactive, and Toys for Bob have found the support to break away, and it's possible WB studios could too, although investors would need deep pockets. The prospects are brightest for Avalanche, with the record-breaking success of Hogwarts Legacy behind it, and Netherrealm, buoyed by the consistent performance of Mortal Kombat. Rocksteady, weighed down by the expensive underperformance of Suicide Squad, has a much gloomier outlook. Nevertheless, "studios with the proven ability to profitably ship AAA titles are valuable assets," says Transcend's Ding. "Strategic buyers, major publishers, platform holders, and private equity seeking revenue quality would all likely take a look in a strategic carve-out scenario." A notable new buyer in the event of Netflix prevailing might be… Paramount. Picking up WB's gaming studios could soften the blow of missing out on the film studio assets – although integrating them would be a significant undertaking and would inevitably involve layoffs. "I expect there to be some streamlining whichever company ends up acquiring," says Harding-Rolls. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity. They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." Brown's outlook remains the bleakest. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity," he says. "They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." "Paramount is hungry to grow a games division, but they can do that without Warner Bros. Meanwhile, Netflix wants video content but not video games. The game and movie industries are both healthier if neither Paramount nor Netflix buys Warner Bros Digital." Lirui Ding and Shanti Bergel at Transcend Fund see a brighter future, in line with the rise of transmedia success stories, from Fortnite to the Sonic movie series, that bridge games and other forms of entertainment. "The biggest opportunity is to demonstrate that games are a first-class content pillar, not a side initiative. If Netflix leans into this third chapter and lets the studios operate with the autonomy required to succeed, it could meaningfully redefine cross-media franchise building. If not, others will capture that value by acquiring the talent and capabilities that emerge. Either way, the long-term winners will be those who understand that content – not tooling or distribution alone – commands the highest value."

Toni Meadows: “Equity markets have been dominated by an AI gold rush in 2025 and this leaves valuations looking expensive by historical comparison. After years of US dominance, the equity market leadership in global indices is highly concentrated both in terms of regional split and the top 10 stocks within the US market. In historical terms, this usually leads to a major rotation or reversal at some point, but the question remains ‘is it different this time due to the unprecedented scope of the technological revolution, driven by data, bandwidth and computing power?’ Thus far, US earnings have surprised on the upside and investors have cheered every AI related deal. Even second derivative trades have done well, as investors seek exposure to companies that are positioned to benefit from the massive AI infrastructure build-out currently underway. “In support of this market environment, economic growth has been sufficient, if not spectacular, and government policy has been supportive. Interest rates have been cut by the western central banks, even as inflation has proven to be ‘sticky’. Given the high stock of outstanding debt and budget deficits – the size of which are usually more suited to a recession than slow growth environments, there is little room to manoeuvre with regard to fiscal policy support. In fact, the world should probably get used to periodic volatility driven by changing sentiment in the debt markets. We saw this with the market reaction to ‘Liberation Day’ in April when Trump unveiled the extent of his tariff policy. Investors are currently sanguine about the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation, and we would not expect that to change in 2026. However, given the combative style of the US President in negotiations of any kind, it is likely there will be policy-induced volatility in markets at some point in 2026. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more “High starting valuations both in equity and debt markets, where spreads are tight, will mean that investors face a wall of worry. On the one hand, fear of missing out will drive prices higher as investors look to the long-term horizon and the benefits of AI on corporate earnings. But in the short-term, much of the large sums of money being spent on AI and its infrastructure will not see a return that justifies the outlay. Also, the interconnected nature of the relationships and spending between the large US tech names increases the potential impact of any disappointments along the way. So, we expect there to be periods of volatility in 2026, and beyond, as investors grapple with the seemingly late cycle characteristics of global markets, framed within the transformational potential of Artificial Intelligence. “One key area to monitor next year will be employment. Thus far, employment conditions have remained tight with headline unemployment rates low, but there are signs developing that a softening is occurring. It probably does not seem like a buoyant employment environment for some key segments of the economy, such as entry level job seekers and recent graduates. The issue with this is that many of those students are the intellectual property (ideas) generators of the future so if they struggle to get on to the employment ladder there could be a significant longer-term impact on the productive capacity of economies. This could ultimately negate some of the ‘benefit’ of AI, especially as companies embracing technology still rely on human earned capital. There could come a period, next year or beyond, where lack of employment opportunities impact consumption patterns and economic growth prospects. If investors have, at that point, exuberantly embraced a tech-based investment cycle by rewarding the share prices of a small number of companies then there could be a correction. “The key for governments and monetary authorities is to help investors to navigate the risks in a balanced manner, though history shows this is easier said than done.” TM: “Stay invested for the long-term outcome but look into methods of protecting gains in portfolios should there be volatility. Also try to find areas where it is possible to harvest returns without taking undue risk. Hybrid bonds might be an area to look into as the issuing companies are investment grade, but the characteristics of the bonds mean that a higher yield is available, and the companies are incentivized to issue them as they have a beneficial impact on their cost of capital.” Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. TM: “Wealth management will, like all major service industries, have to rise to the challenge of using technology to the benefit of clients. This will take the form of improved efficiency in workflows such as report production, documentation and communication. The key will be integrating technology into a human-led relationship with clients, that through its efficiency and speed of delivery, leads to clear decision-making – enhancing the client’s goals whilst maintaining a trusted relationship with the client.”

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Beanie Babies (CC BY 2.0) by Dominique Godbout GameStop (NYSE:GME) is the O.G. of meme stocks, the company that sparked the retail trading frenzy in 2021 and turned it into a Wall Street punchline. But those glory days are ancient history. The once-dominant video game retailer just dropped its third-quarter earnings. While showing strong year-over-year profit growth, the core business is crumbling under the weight of digital downloads and subscription services. Its lone bright spot was once again collectibles, now 31% of revenue — up from 20% last year — and the only segment indicating growth. GameStop has flopped at pivoting to digital gaming, with software sales tanking 27%. It even hopped on the crypto treasury trend, stacking Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) on its balance sheet, but the crypto winter crushed that bet, leaving holdings underwater. Right now, collectibles are its sole lifeline, but is that enough to bet on this fading giant? GameStop’s latest report paints a mixed picture: impressive bottom-line gains masking top-line woes. While net income more than quadrupled to $77.1 million and operating income flipped to a $41.3 million profit from a $33.4 million loss, revenue declined 4.6%. Hardware and accessories, the biggest segment at 45% of sales, dropped 12% to $367.4 million as physical consoles lose ground. Software plunged even harder, down 27% to $197.5 million, hammered by the digital shift. Collectibles, now the second-largest reportable segment at $256.1 million, rose 50% year-over-year, fueled by demand for Funko Pops and trading cards. Gross profit climbed to $273.4 million on tighter inventory and lower markdowns while cash swelled to $8.8 billion, bolstered by prior equity raises. But investors weren’t impressed, and the stock is dipping 6% in pre-market trading this morning, signaling doubts about sustainability. This isn’t much of a turnaround; it looks more like damage control. Collectibles have become GameStop’s crutch, but don’t mistake it for a growth engine. Sure, it’s profitable, as higher margins on toys and memorabilia helped lift overall gross profit. Yet, the market for physical collectibles is niche and stagnant, tied to nostalgia rather than explosive expansion. With gaming going digital, foot traffic in GameStop’s 3,000 stores is evaporating, limiting collectibles’ upside. At 31% of revenue, it’s a bigger slice of a shrinking pie, not a path to restoring the company’s meme-era highs. That’s precisely why GameStop latched onto crypto — a desperate swing for relevance in a blockchain-obsessed world. GameStop’s foray into crypto treasury mimics plays by firms like Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), but with less firepower. Starting in March, it began hoarding Bitcoin as a hedge against its dying retail model, viewing it as “digital gold” for balance sheet diversification. The retailer’s holdings stood at 4,710 bitcoin at the end of the quarter, the same amount purchased in Q2 (it didn’t buy — or sell — any in Q3). Valued at $519.4 million, they represent a $19.4 million cumulative unrealized gain, but for the current quarter it booked a $9.2 million unrealized loss. The crypto winter — sparked by macroeconomic concerns that triggered an October “flash crash” — wiped out larger gains. Unlike Strategy’s aggressive debt-fueled buys, GameStop’s approach feels half-hearted, more Hail Mary than strategy. The approach is better than taking on massive debt, but is also a reminder that crypto treasuries amplify risks for legacy firms like this one. GameStop has essentially surrendered on reviving its core video game retail business, with its digital pivot tattered and physical sales tumbling. All hope is now pinned on a Bitcoin bull run to juice its $519 million stash and spark a valuation rebound. The video game retailer is walking a high-wire act. It isn’t Strategy or even Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMEX:BMNR), which is pursuing a similar course, but with Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). They have focused crypto mandates and deeper expertise, while GameStop has collectibles. Toys might offer steady cash flow, but they’re no growth rocket. Investors thinking of buying in or holding on must confront the reality: Do you really want exposure to a collectibles retailer moonlighting as a bitcoin holder? It’s speculative at best, a meme relic at worst. Best to avoid it altogether and invest in companies with real potential. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Wins, setbacks, and rivalries: Inside Cindy Rose's first 100 days as CEO of ad giant WPP

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Cindy Rose took the helm at the advertising agency giant WPP in September, she inherited one of the most challenging jobs on Madison Avenue. Battered by a period of big account losses, internal restructuring, and thousands of layoffs, morale had sunk. So had the share price. London-based WPP was trading at lows not seen since 2009, and the company had warned investors that the remainder of the year would continue to be rocky. Insiders and shareholders were hopeful that Rose, a US-born executive most recently at Microsoft, could serve as a kind of Goldilocks porridge compared to her predecessors. She was widely seen as a happy medium between Martin Sorrell, the outspoken British business mogul who had built WPP from the ground up over 33 years, and Mark Read, the more introverted operator who took over in 2018. Rose was described by one analyst as a "peacemaker," and her tech background and experience in maintaining client relationships were viewed as positive attributes that would help bring about much-needed change. This week, Rose marked her 100th day in the role. Darren Woolley, CEO of the management consultancy Trinity P3, scored Rose a "7.8 out of 10" for her performance so far. "She's saying all the right things and has sent some signals to the market. The big test will be what happens early next year, as she sets out her strategy," Woolley said. "Cindy will not last a year if they don't believe the strategy can be delivered." Rose's wins during her first 100 days — some major new business, key hires, a big partnership with Google, and an oversubscribed bond sale — have been dampened by bad news. On her first earnings call, in October, Rose described the company's performance as "unacceptable." Shortly after delivering its second profit warning of the year and downgrading its full-year growth forecast, its shares spiraled further downward, and WPP was demoted from the FTSE 100 index of the UK's largest publicly listed companies. Shares of the London-listed company have dropped by about 18% since Rose became chief executive. Adding to Rose's overflowing in-tray, WPP was hit with a lawsuit from one of its former executives who said he was fired in July of this year — before Rose's arrival as CEO — after he raised concerns internally that the group's media investment division was allegedly running a kickback scheme. WPP said in November it would "vigorously" defend itself against the allegations made in the suit. The case is ongoing. WPP has fallen behind the sector's star performer, Publicis Groupe, and it faces a new titan following the combo of Omnicom and IPG this year. Agencyland also faces a bigger, existential quandary: What is the role of a large advertising agency holding company amid the rise of tech and the emergence of AI solutions that claim to automate much of the work agencies charge top dollar for? This account of Rose's tenure so far draws on interviews with more than a dozen current and former WPP staffers and clients, competitors, marketing consultants, and industry analysts. They said Rose deserves credit for delivering a positive narrative about WPP's opportunities while also owning its problems. Much of her fate will rest on a strategy plan that she has said she will outline fully next year. Insiders and analysts said her strategy will need to be bold and visionary, given the challenges ahead. Rose told Business Insider in a statement that in her first 100 days, she has actively sought feedback from WPP's top clients to help create a blueprint for what the company needs to do differently in the future. "I'm most proud of our WPP employees for their incredible resilience, client obsession, and passion to win, which is already making a difference, and you can see it in the business that we're winning: Mastercard, Reckitt, Henkel, and more to come," Rose said. This past September, from the company's 3 World Trade Center campus in New York City, Rose laid out a three-pronged blueprint for what she called "a new WPP" at her first global town hall as CEO. Her first priority was "putting people first" by creating an environment for employees to thrive. She said WPP should be famous for "being completely client-obsessed" as part of her "winning for clients" principle. And she said WPP should be "harnessing our AI advantage," telling staffers to become "AI superusers." Her opening address to employees was received well internally, insiders said. "We were pleasantly surprised," one current senior WPP agency staffer said. They added that Rose is "so much better at the human stuff" than her predecessors and said she had kept the company regularly updated with videos talking up the agency's wins. WPP has been heavily pitching WPP Open, an internal AI-powered platform that integrates with technology from companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Salesforce. It connects signals from clients' own first-party data, partners, and WPP's data on the performance of thousands of campaigns to help plan and place ads, and measure the results. In October, with Rose firmly in situ, WPP announced WPP Open Pro, a self-service version to give clients their own access to the platform. The aim was to grow WPP's client base by appealing to smaller advertisers or direct-to-consumer companies that tend to handle much of their marketing in-house. WPP told staffers internally that more than 400 brands had proactively contacted the company about Open Pro in the three weeks after it launched. Douglas Hayward and Gerry Murray, analysts at the research company IDC, described the Open Pro launch in a report as "a smart move that shows that WPP is prepared to be bold and innovative and even to cannibalize its revenue in the short term." However, some analysts questioned whether WPP would be able to invest enough in marketing Open Pro to appeal to this sort of audience, which is accustomed to using tools provided by tech giants like Meta and Google. Nearly all of WPP's rivals are also leaning heavily into their tech investments and offerings as part of their pitches to clients and investors. One former WPP agency executive, who left last year, said they felt Rose should be more proactive in emphasizing the company's creative prowess as something that sets it apart from other agency holding groups and the broader tech sector. "Creativity is the only thing that human beings have got to make a difference," the exec said. Agency relationships with tech platforms are an important part of the mix as they try to differentiate themselves from competitors. This fall, in Mountain View, Rose signed a key deal with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, which sent a signal out to the market, clients, and its rivals about the strength of WPP's relationship with Google. The "expanded five-year partnership" was billed as going far beyond typical agency-Google setups. WPP said it would commit to spending $400 million on Google's tech as part of the partnership, which will give it "preferred" access to Google's latest AI models and data. Google is also one of WPP's biggest clients. Save for her welcome address to staffers, which was posted on YouTube, and her first earnings call, Rose has kept a fairly low public profile. In November, she appeared at an AI conference in New York City, hosted by Microsoft and Luma Partners, an investment bank. Attendees — who included roughly 100 high-profile tech, advertising, and media executives — said she was whisked away by her handlers into the green room before her talk, a session with Google Americas President Sean Downey, and made a swift exit afterward. Three attendees said they felt Rose missed an opportunity. "Martin, in the old days, would have worked the room for one hour," one person said, referring to Sorrell, the former WPP CEO. At the moment, WPP is a company that "needs more visible leadership for the market, for the staff, for the shareholders, for the clients," Trinity P3's Woolley said. Rose enters an advertising agency landscape that has fundamentally changed. For years, WPP was the top dog. WPP under Sorrell built a formidable empire, acquiring creative agencies and PR shops around the world, and building GroupM (now known as WPP Media) into a huge force, responsible for planning and buying billions of dollars in media across TV, print, out-of-home, and digital. The market dynamics shifted, largely due to the emergence of tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, which offer self-service tools that let advertisers bypass agencies. AI has only sped up the disruption. In recent years, clients have pressured agencies to produce more work at lower costs. Agencies have had to respond by retooling to offer marketers more services than just producing and placing ads. Rival ad firm Publicis recognized these shifts early. It made first-party data and technology services its citadels and simplified its pitch around a "power of one" operating strategy. In 2024, the French company became the biggest holding company by revenue, and over the past 18 months has won a string of clients — including many from WPP. Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun is described by many in the industry as a charismatic and omnipresent force of nature with clients, and a fierce competitor to Rose as she seeks to retain major accounts and acquire new ones. During the pitch process this year for Mars' $1.7 billion media business — before Rose was in-post as WPP CEO — the confectionery giant summoned all the agencies involved to meet on a cold January morning at the M&M's Store in central London. Sadoun turned up about an hour earlier than the scheduled time. The Mars clients hadn't arrived yet, and the doors to the store were locked shut. He waited outside on Leicester Square. Once Mars' marketing team arrived, Sadoun greeted them, and they duly invited him in for coffee — much to the chagrin of the competing agencies, who weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity to get extra face time with the clients. Mars this summer moved its media account from WPP to Publicis. "There are two types of people in life: The ones who are five minutes early and the ones who are five minutes late. It's a personal choice, and Arthur has decided to use these rules for unfair advantage by arriving 10 minutes early," said Richard Robinson, executive director of Ingenuity+, an agency search consultancy that wasn't involved in the Mars pitch. Three marketing consultants involved in client pitches said Rose is also visible and warm with clients, delivering passionate addresses and asking personal questions. They say Sadoun takes it to the next level. Focus now turns to 2026 after WPP's annus horribilis. WPP has appointed the management consulting firm McKinsey to assist Rose in conducting a strategic review of the business. Rose said in October that she would detail the outcome in the new year. Insiders and analysts predict further layoffs amid a shrinking agency landscape. Jay Pattisall, principal analyst and VP at the research company, forecasts a 15% reduction in agency jobs across the industry as automation and AI force agencies to "pivot from selling services to selling solutions." The open question is whether WPP can be optimized to success, or whether it will have to sell some or all of its business in order to best position itself for the future. Or could WPP even pull an Omnicom and acquire a rival? Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said WPP had multiple conversations about a potential acquisition of the US-centric media buying company Horizon over the years, but that the talks never came close to a deal. A Horizon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on speculation. "They need to do some kind of jujitsu," a second former WPP executive said, referring to an unexpected M&A move to outmaneuver rivals. As insiders await the outcome of the review, WPP is expected to soon start feeling the impact of some recent sizable new business wins. It secured more than $1.5 billion in billings in November alone, including the consumer goods company Reckitt appointing WPP as its media agency of record and Henkel awarding WPP the media duties for its European consumer brands. WPP was further buoyed this week after its Wavemaker media agency secured a four-year contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to produce the UK government's ad campaigns — an account previously held by Omnicom. Rose has also made some key leadership appointments and formed a new executive management team that could help rally the troops and boost momentum. In one notable hire — and a poke in the eye to rival Sadoun — she persuaded Laurent Ezekiel, who was formerly WPP's CMO, to reverse a planned move to Publicis and become CEO of the WPP agency Ogilvy instead. Some investors appear optimistic that Rose can steer the company back on course. This month, investors ordered nearly €3 billion (about $3.5 billion) of WPP's 5.5-year bonds, even though the company only issued €1 billion (about $1.2 billion). The strong oversubscription suggests these institutional investors believe WPP will stay financially stable and meet its debt obligations. Rose, in her statement, said that her vision for WPP is clear and that AI would usher in a "golden age of marketing." Looking ahead to 2026, she said WPP's greatest opportunity is "to enable our clients to move boldly and confidently into the future and help them fully embrace AI innovation to reimagine growth and unleash their true potential."

Title: How Netflix’s WB Megadeal Stunned Hollywood — and Sparked a Fight From David Ellison

Who do you believe? The battle for control of Warner Bros. and HBO is coming down to an enormous bet on competing visions of the future of the entertainment industry. On Dec. 5, Netflix landed a whale of a deal that sent shock waves through the community. The streamer that has upended traditional Hollywood is planning to join the ranks of studio owners with an $87.2 billion agreement to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Netflix had managed to outflank David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which for nearly four months had been making increasingly rich offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including linear TV networks like CNN, TNT, HGTV and Food Network. Related Stories Justin Theroux on Playing a 'Rich and Stupid' Himbo in 'Devil Wears Prada 2,' Entering the 'Fallout' Universe and His New Campaign for Marriott's Luxury Collection Amazon's 'Fallout' Season 1 to Stream for Free on Samsung TV Plus Ellison — angered by what he felt was an unfair sales process conducted by the Warner Bros. Discovery board and chief David Zaslav — played his next chess move on Dec. 8: Paramount announced a hostile takeover bid of $30 a share for WBD, a proposed pact with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. “We’re taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve transparency and the ability to make an informed decision,” Ellison told investors and analysts on a call, noting that WBD had not responded in any way to his company’s latest offer. “Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.” Popular on Variety Sarandos, at least publicly, was unruffled. “Today’s move was entirely expected,” he said at a UBS investor conference hours after Paramount made its move. “We have a deal done. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.” The trenches have been dug, and it will likely be weeks or months before it becomes clear what will happen to Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD said its board will review Paramount’s competing proposal (as required by law) and will issue a recommendation in 10 business days, by Dec. 19. But for the time being, Warner Bros. Discovery is still officially supporting the Netflix deal. The duel between Netflix and Paramount (and who knows if others will emerge) is shaping up to be the most contentious M&A brawl since the early 1990s, when John Malone and Barry Diller scrapped with Sumner Redstone over the acquisition of Paramount Pictures (with Redstone’s Viacom ultimately sealing the deal for the studio). In the war for Warner Bros., against the swirling backdrop of egos, money and market power, there’s another X factor: President Donald Trump, who has exerted control over federal agencies. On Dec. 7, while making his way down the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” in the approval process for the Netflix deal. According to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO sought to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix com bined with WB and HBO Max. Sarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.” He added, “It could be a problem.” Meanwhile, Trump is friendly with Ellison and his billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump has boasted, and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying, “He’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anti-competitive grounds. But in a surprise turn, the Ellisons faced Trump’s lash — a sign of the fickle environment in D.C. in which the megamerger will be evaluated. The president slammed Paramount over an interview that ran on the Dec. 7 episode of “60 Minutes” featuring Georgia politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump friend-turned-foe. “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP,” Trump fumed in a Truth Social post. On Monday, asked if he supported Paramount’s deal for WBD, Trump told reporters at a White House briefing, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact market share for Netflix and Paramount Skydance. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, miscalculated in the fall when he triggered the bidding war for Warner Bros. by making an unsolicited offer to buy the company. Ellison’s theory was that, fresh off Skydance Media’s completion of the Paramount Global acquisition in August, he could move fast to preempt rival bidders by offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety ahead of WBD’s planned split into two parts next year. He knew other parties — which ended up being Comcast and Netflix — would be interested in buying just WBD’s streaming and studio divisions, and Ellison believed his was the cleaner, more compelling offer. In addition to the Ellison family’s backing, Paramount’s Dec. 1 offer included $24 billion in funding from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. But Ellison’s gambit drew out other bidders. During the auction process, Netflix’s two CEOs, Sarandos and Greg Peters, played their cards closer to the vest. In public, they were noncommittal about their interest in Warner Bros., even as they were already in touch with WBD about a potential deal. Peters, at a conference in early October, downplayed the company’s desire to grow through a major acquisition. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers — they don’t have an amazing track record over time,” he said. Ellison, meanwhile, let it be known that going after Warner Bros. Discovery was all part of a master plan to scale Paramount to a global player. After chatter that Zaslav was leaning toward Netflix, Ellison and his team grew concerned they were losing the deal — and they were frustrated, as they felt they offered the higher premium and had been open about the importance of WBD to the larger strategic plan for Paramount Skydance. Paramount lawyers, in a Dec. 3 letter to Zaslav that was leaked to the press, alleged the board of Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a “myopic” bidding process “with a predetermined outcome” that favored Netflix. WBD’s lawyers responded that the board had “fully and robustly complied” with its fiduciary obligations. In a last-ditch scramble, Paramount extended its $30/share offer to WBD on Dec. 4. It was the sixth offer Paramount made to Warner Bros. over a 12-week span. “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets,” Ellison had texted Zaslav that day, according to a Paramount SEC filing revealing details of the M&A campaign. Ellison never received a reply. In the end, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted in Netflix: a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with a solid financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO. Netflix’s bid of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros.’ streaming and studios arms was deemed higher than Paramount’s final offer of $30 a share for all of WBD (inclusive of the TV networks). Shortly after 5 a.m. PT last Friday, Sarandos jumped on a conference call with Wall Street analysts to tout the monster deal Netflix — once dismissed by the Hollywood establishment as a wannabe power player — had negotiated. “I know some of you are surprised that we’re making this acquisition,” Sarandos said on the predawn call, sounding exhausted but ebullient. The blockbuster deal, Sarandos enthused, would combine Warner Bros.’ “incredible library of shows and movies” — ranging from classics like “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to modern hit franchises like Harry Potter and “Friends” — with Netflix’s “culture-defining titles,” such as “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Squid Game.” Under the pact, Netflix also would get the Warner Bros. Games division and the legendary Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. Sarandos had been up late the night before, putting the final touches on the WB deal after several marathon days of phone and video calls, emails and text-message chains. Netflix buttoned up the agreement with WBD and Zaslav at around 7 p.m. PT on Dec. 4. Among the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. Netflix said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations “and build on its strengths,” including maintaining theatrical releases for WB films. Currently, Warner Bros. has deals to release its movies in cinemas through 2029. In the near term, Netflix also will keep HBO Max as a discrete service. “Nothing is changing today,” the company told its millions of customers in an email sent Friday. But anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining and eliminating redundancies. Netflix expects to see $2 billion-$3 billion in cost savings annually by the third year after the WB deal closes. Paramount said it saw upwards of $6 billion in cost synergies if it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery. And that, of course, signals looming layoffs on top of the thousands of job cuts the industry has seen in recent years. Opposition to the Netflix-WB deal assembled swiftly and fiercely across Hollywood, arising from unions, actors, directors, theater owners, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. Fueling the objections: In addition to the deal buttressing Netflix’s already formidable streaming lead with HBO Max and giving it control over the output of a major studio, Netflix has long shown an antipathy toward putting movies in theaters. Even if Netflix is derailed in its plans to swallow Warner Bros. — by Ellison’s rival bid or by regulatory agencies — the company has demonstrated a major flex. The fact that the 28-year-old streaming provider is now poised to own one of the biggest and oldest Hollywood studios cements the primacy of direct-to-consumer entertainment. Netflix, Sarandos suggested, can pull Warner Bros. and HBO into the future. “I think our more modern approach to the business model to connect people with these great stories is going to be a big win for all — every constituent involved,” he told investors. But movie theater operators are not feeling as upbeat, to put it mildly. Some theater owners are openly rooting against Netflix’s chance to vacuum up Warner Bros. The proposed deal “poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,” Michael O’Leary, CEO of trade group Cinema United, said in a statement. It will, he said, hurt theaters “from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.” Warners has been on a roll this year. It has been No. 1 in movie market share after releasing hits like “Sinners,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Superman” and “Weapons” in theaters. Netflix does release some movies in theaters, but on hundreds of screens (or fewer), not thousands as with a typical wide release. And Netflix mainly debuts original movies in theaters to qualify for Oscars. Sarandos didn’t exactly give a ringing endorsement of the theatrical experience — which he earlier this year dubbed “outdated” — even as he promised to honor Warner Bros.’ commitments to release upcoming films in cinemas. “I think, over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker,” he said Friday. David Ellison is trying to mine industry discontent over Netflix’s Warner Bros. play. On Monday Paramount pledged to release more than 30 films in theaters if it wins WBD — a swipe at Netflix. “Our focus is on expanding creative output, not dominating the sector, as Netflix envisions,” Ellison said. SEE ALSO: Paramount Claims WBD Is Overvaluing CNN, TBS and Other TV Networks — Alleging That Means Netflix’s Deal Is Worse for Shareholders If the Warner Bros. deal with Netflix goes through as outlined, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch. It’s not known what role he might have if Paramount’s bid prevails. But if Zaslav does exit in the wake of a sale, he’ll gain many millions of dollars from stock and options and a bonus payout, as will senior WB and HBO execs. And if Netflix is the winning party, Zaslav also will have the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the Netflix merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys. What about Warner Bros.’ rank and file? Zaslav told staffers in a town hall meeting last Friday that the pending sale to Netflix is unlikely to result in sweeping layoffs, as the streamer’s “intention is that they want to keep most people.” Sarandos asserted that Netflix is “not cutting jobs,” whereas Paramount and Comcast have been “laying people off and cutting things.” As for handling movies, Sarandos emphasized that one of Warner Bros.’ strengths is its ability to distribute movies around the world. “We didn’t buy this company to destroy that value,” Sarandos observed. There will be a lot of back and forth in the days ahead as Paramount presses its case to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators. Netflix says it expects its deal to take 12-18 months, following WBD’s planned spinoff of its linear TV channels into Discovery Global in the third quarter. Paramount predicted it could complete a WBD takeover in 12 months. But Paramount’s challenge is likely to prolong the process for either buyer. Netflix’s WB-HBO Max deal represents a horizontal merger between rival streaming services as well as a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. “I don’t think this is a slam dunk for the companies,” says Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. That deal also would face scrutiny from European Union regulators and those in other countries, and Netflix may have to agree to restrictions or spinoffs to satisfy local regulators. Netflix execs voiced optimism that the WB acquisition will be OK’d. “[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts on Friday. Even if American regulators try to spike Netflix’s WB deal, that wouldn’t necessarily doom it. Recall that during Trump’s first term, the DOJ sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, claiming the merger constrained supply of “must-have” content, like CNN and TNT. (The lawsuit reportedly was motivated by Trump’s displeasure with CNN.) But a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies, and in February 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. A key question will be how to define the streaming marketplace. The Netflix and WBD teams suggested the enlarged company would still be competing for consumer dollars against the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu and traditional TV. Moreover, all of them are vying for watch time with internet-video powerhouses YouTube and TikTok. But this may not be a convincing argument in an antitrust review. “The agencies do not believe that everything competes with everything,” Waller says. “There is not a general market for eyeballs.” At this point, after losing the hearts and minds of WBD’s board, David Ellison seems to be placing his chips on the narrative — pitched to the Trump administration, regulatory bodies across the globe and Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders — that Netflix would run afoul of antitrust laws if it got hold of Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have approximately 200 million global subscribers, “which puts us on par with Disney,” Ellison told investors. That’s significantly below Netflix and HBO Max, which together would clock in at more than 400 million. “Our deal is completely pro-competitive. It’s pro-creative talent, pro-consumer,” Ellison said. The Warner Bros.-Netflix combination, he asserted, “would give them such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer, and is anticompetitive in every way that you can fundamentally look at it.” In the coming weeks, Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is expected to come back to WBD with another formal takeover offer — one that would top its most recent $30/share bid. Netflix, of course, paints a different picture of its agreement with WBD. “We think it’s good for consumers. We think it’s good for creators,” Sarandos told investors. “We think it’s great for the entertainment industry as a whole, because we’re creating and protecting jobs in production.” Soon, Warner Bros. Discovery board members and shareholders will have to choose between dueling bids and dueling narratives.

Title: Netflix director takes the stand, recounts 5-week scramble to save sci-fi project at heart of his $11 million fraud trial

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a week of testimony about how Carl Rinsch spent millions of dollars on luxury mattresses, Uber Eats, Rolls-Royces, and stock and crypto trades — but not the sci-fi epic that Netflix ordered — the director got to tell his side of the story. On the witness stand Tuesday, Rinsch cast his dispute with Netflix as one big misunderstanding. In 2018, the streaming service had agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars on "White Horse," a sci-fi project that depicted a world where artificial, clone-like beings created their own society after a schism with humankind. The show had the endorsement of Keanu Reeves, who starred in Rinsch's movie "47 Ronin." By November of 2019, Rinsch had spent more than the $44 million Netflix had agreed to pay for one season of the show. With the project overbudget and unfinished, Rinsch and Netflix executives needed to determine what to do next. Would Rinsch agree to cede some creative control to Netflix, surrendering his prized "final cut" privilege? Would he reduce his ambitions and complete the single season Netflix initially ordered? Or would Netflix give him a bigger budget to deliver two seasons? In Rinsch's eyes, he was ready to deliver Netflix a mega-franchise on par with "Star Wars" or "Game of Thrones," and was negotiating the terms for a sequel. He had already spent millions of dollars of his own money on the passion project, he testified, and wanted to go bigger. "This was, in my eyes, a franchise," he testified Tuesday. "It wasn't just one movie." In March 2020, Netflix sent Rinsch's production company an additional $11 million — the money at the center of his Manhattan federal court fraud trial. According to prosecutors, Rinsch used the funds for a personal spending spree. Rinsch, on Tuesday, testified that he completed all the production work Netflix expected — at a fraction of the price. The rest, he said, was his to keep. The director ultimately never completed a single season of "White Horse." Wearing a black three-piece suit with a dark purple tie and pocket square, Rinsch faced the jury as he spoke in a quiet and forceful tone. He kept a sober expression. In a courthouse elevator during the lunch break, he looked heavenward and uttered a short prayer. The stakes are high. Rinsch — once a Hollywood rising star and protégé of Ridley Scott — has already lost his career and all of his money. If convicted on all charges, he could spend up to 90 years in prison. A keystone of the criminal trial is a March 2020 email that Bryan Noon, then a Netflix executive, sent to Rinsch and his lawyer the day before the $11 million payment. According to the email, the $11 million was meant to go toward production costs on "White Horse," which had stalled after wrapping up a shoot in Budapest the previous fall. Noon said Rinsch was required to spend the funds in a five-week period for editing the existing footage and for the costs of storyboards, production design, costume design, location booking, securing talent, and building sets for future filming. Rinsch testified Tuesday that he estimated all of that would cost only $500,000. "It's too much money," Rinsch told jurors. "I would never spend $11 million in five weeks." The other $10.5 million, Rinsch testified, was meant to reimburse him for costs he had paid out of his own pocket to continue filming "White Horse" while the production had gone over-budget. "I had a crew of probably 100 people staying in a hotel — everybody's ordering room service, everybody's exposed," Rinsch said. "So the idea was I subsidize and pay for us all to be here while we negotiate what the sequel is going to be. That was my cost — and it was a very big cost." Some jurors wore coats in the chilly courtroom on the 14th floor of the lower Manhattan courthouse, where temperatures outside dipped to 30 degrees. One juror nodded along as Rinsch said that Netflix, in his view, owed him money at the time. The director contended that he had completed principal photography on the first season of "White Horse" by the end of November 2019, when he had shot scenes in Budapest. In his understanding, Netflix executives wanted him to conduct "soft pre-production" over five weeks and show them visual concepts that would help them decide whether to order a second season — before the first season even hit the streaming service. In his testimony on Tuesday, Rinsch walked the jury through some of his spending in the weeks following the March 2020 deal that he said was for the production of "White Horse." Rinsch hired Clayton Townsend, an experienced producer who had worked on several Judd Apatow and "Fast and Furious" movies, paying his production company $30,000. He also paid over $33,000 to secure a castle in Vienna as a shooting location. He testified about the Rolls-Royces the government accused him of buying with Netflix's money. He explained that in the sci-fi world of "White Horse," he had wanted a "fleet of Rolls-Royces" carrying diplomats between the areas controlled by humans and those controlled by the "organic intelligent" beings. Rinsch said he continued working on the show throughout 2020 and early 2021, including hiring a production designer to put together concept art. Netflix didn't formally tell him it was done with "White Horse" until March 2021, Rinsch said. In a civil legal dispute with Netflix, Rinsch's side of the story didn't prevail. An arbitrator in May 2024 awarded the company $8.8 million and control over the "White Horse" footage. Rinsch was indicted by federal prosecutors nearly a year later. On cross-examination, Rinsch gave explanations that contradicted the accounts of other witnesses. And, at times, that appeared to contradict himself. During cross-examination, a prosecutor showed Rinsch transcripts of his under-oath answers from a deposition and a hearing tied to his earlier legal dispute with Netflix. While Rinsch said Tuesday that the bulk of the $11 million was for himself, he said in those earlier settings that he would use the funds for additional production work. Rinsch said he completed filming principal photography for the first season of "White Horse," and that planned shoots in Kenya and Holland were meant for a second season. Former Netflix executives testified earlier in the trial, however, that the planned shoots were for scenes that were part of the script for the first season. Under questioning on Tuesday, Rinsch didn't address testimony about him rushing to spend millions of dollars on luxury goods in 2021. Nor did Rinsch share his own account of meetings with former Netflix executive Peter Friedlander, where Friedlander testified that he flew to the set of "White Horse" in Budapest to try to resolve budget issues, but the director walked out of them without a resolution. Ahead of the trial, Rinsch's lawyers said that his "mental state" could be an issue in the case. While the trial didn't feature any testimony about Rinsch's mental health, jurors saw outlandish text messages and emails he sent to Cindy Holland, the highest-ranking Netflix executive overseeing "White Horse." In one document attached to an email, Rinsch laid out a scenario where President Donald Trump would "mobilize Chinese community and create a destabilization" of Chinese President Xi Jinping "by unifying the Chinese people to support the one thing they fear more than XJ… death." He cited this scenario among his reasons for making risky options trades in the pharmaceutical company Gilead. "I was hedging the market," Rinsch said during cross-examination. "In the instance that we had a total calamity where millions of people died, we would be able to continue working on this show." Rinsch ultimately lost millions of dollars on his Gilead trades. It was a long way from when Holland sat in Keanu Reeves' home and read the script for "White Horse," thinking it could be the next big thing. "I thought it had incredible potential," Holland testified. Jump to

Title: Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/will-nvidia-nvda-stock-hit-500-by-2030/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:18:03Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable. There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though? The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable. Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short. As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever. Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options. If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors? From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home. In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending. Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999. The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China. If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.” The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests. It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders. Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside. Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat. All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor. Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: QYLD Turns Mag 7 Tech Stocks Into an 11% Dividend Yield
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/qyld-turns-mag-7-tech-stocks-into-an-11-dividend-yield/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:48:19Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) transforms the Nasdaq-100’s top technology stocks into an 11% monthly dividend by selling covered call options against its holdings. Unlike traditional dividend ETFs, QYLD generates income exclusively through option premiums. The fund sells near-the-money call options on its entire portfolio each month, collecting premiums from buyers who purchase the right to buy shares at specific strike prices. This strategy produces consistent monthly income but caps upside participation when tech stocks rally sharply. The fund’s $8 billion portfolio concentrates heavily in technology at 57% of the total ETF, and communication services at 17%. The top holdings – Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms – represent over half the fund and drive most option premium generation. QYLD’s 11.5% yield depends entirely on market volatility, not underlying dividends. The fund’s top holdings pay minimal natural yields: NVDA offers just 0.02%, AAPL 0.37%, and MSFT 0.70%. Amazon pays no dividend. This means QYLD’s monthly distributions fluctuate based on option premium levels, which compress during low-volatility periods. Recent dividend history reveals declining payouts. Monthly distributions averaged $0.198 in 2021 but have dropped 17% to approximately $0.169 currently. This decline reflects lower implied volatility in tech stocks as markets stabilized following pandemic-era swings. When volatility decreases, call options command lower premiums, directly reducing QYLD’s distributable income. The fund’s structure also creates total return concerns. While delivering high current income, QYLD’s net asset value has eroded 23% from its December 2021 peak of $22.82 to the current $17.54. This capital depreciation occurs because covered calls cap participation in bull market rallies. When tech stocks surge—as they did throughout 2023-2024—QYLD surrenders upside gains beyond strike prices. Investors receive steady income but miss appreciation that Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) holders capture fully. The concentration in highly valued tech stocks adds risk. NVDA trades at 46 times earnings with a beta of 2.28, creating extreme volatility that generates premiums but exposes the fund to sharp drawdowns. The April 2025 drop to $14.48 demonstrated this downside vulnerability. Income reliability remains strong—QYLD has paid monthly since 2013 without interruption. However, distribution amounts fluctuate with market conditions, and the declining trend suggests caution for investors expecting stable 11% yields indefinitely. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPI) offers a more diversified approach to option income generation. Rather than concentrating in tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, JEPI writes calls on a broader S&P 500-based portfolio with lower volatility stocks. The fund currently yields approximately 7.4% with more stable monthly distributions and less exposure to mega-cap tech concentration risk. JEPI combines equity-linked notes with covered calls, providing flexibility to adjust option strategies based on market conditions while maintaining consistent income generation.

Title: Pro-AI super PAC launches first candidate ads | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A new pro-AI network of political action committees is releasing its first candidate ads in the 2026 midterms, as the debate around artificial intelligence ramps up ahead of the elections. The ads from Leading the Future, a pro-AI bipartisan network of associated PACs, focus on congressional races in Texas and New York and are a likely preview of the vast amounts of money the technology industry could spend ahead of next year’s elections. The ads were shared first with CNN. Leading the Future said these ads are the “opening phase” of its effort in the upcoming midterm elections; the two ads are part of seven-figure ad campaign for the respective primaries, with more to come, the group told CNN. Other groups are also breaking out their wallets: Two former members of Congress, Democrat Brad Carson and Republican Chris Stewart, have joined forces to create a new organization called Public First, and network of super PACs that will back efforts and candidates who want to regulate AI. Meta recently launched its own bipartisan super PAC called American Technology Excellence Project, which aims in part to counter efforts to regulate AI at the state level. The stakes are enormous: In just a few years, AI has become a major driver of the US stock market and a force in the economy, as well as a major player in people’s everyday lives. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first $5 trillion company earlier this year after demand for its products surged. Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Oracle, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech companies have poured billions of dollars into hiring, research and development of AI products, looking for ways to secure a lead in the AI race and dominate a still-growing market. But critics say the rush to build ever-more complex AI models carries enormous risks in areas like privacy and child safety, with a regulatory framework that lags far behind the rapid advances in technology. And even some tech pioneers warn that AI poses potential dangers to the economy and to the world. Recent polling from the Pew Research Center released in November shows nearly identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats say they are more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life. And in September, Gallup found 80% of US adults “believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly.” Leading the Future advocates for a federal regulatory framework on AI instead of state level regulations – a policy favored by the industry and President Donald Trump’s administration. On Monday, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level in favor of a federal level “rulebook,” though it’s not clear what that would look like. The Trump administration argues state regulations threaten to stymie America’s AI industry, which is a national security priority. Congress could take up a possible framework for AI regulation within the next year – House Democrats announced on Tuesday they are setting up a Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy to “develop policy expertise in partnership” with AI companies and other stakeholders. Leading the Future’s new ads underscore this divide, with one ad in support of a Texas candidate and another targeting a New York candidate. One ad supports Chris Gober, a lawyer running in the Republican primary for the new Texas 10th congressional district. The ad calls Gober, who previously worked with Elon Musk on his America Super PAC as well as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a stalwart “Trump conservative.” Though the ad is paid for by American Mission, part of Leading the Future’s network, it does not mention AI directly, only referring to “promoting American technology investment” in the race to beat China. Gober told CNN in an email that he’s running to “champion” the “world-class innovators” in his district and to promote policies “that ensure America wins the global technology race.” The second ad targets New York State Assemblyman Alex Bores, who is running in New York’s 12th congressional district and has made a name for himself as an outspoken voice for AI safety guardrails. And unlike Gober’s ad, the ad targeting Bores from Leading the Future’s Think Big PAC leans heavily into criticizing Bores for wanting to regulate AI at the state level. In response, Bores criticized President Trump’s recent actions on AI and what he called a “handful of AI billionaires” angry because he “would dare to stand up to them to protect our jobs, our kids’ minds, and our security.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading modestly lower as the big day has finally arrived: the Federal Reserve will wrap up its last meeting of 2025, and the odds still heavily favor a 25-basis-point rate hike. The worry hanging over traders is that many fear a “hawkish rate cut.” Where they do cut 25 basis points, but the commentary from Chairman Powell could be hawkish, and future cuts could be moved to the sidelines. The major indices finished mixed on Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower by 0.38% at 47,560, while the S&P 500 closed flat at 6,840. The Nasdaq put in a winning session, finishing trading at 23,576, up 0.13%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday as bond traders, like their equity counterparts, are laser-focused on the Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the commentary that will follow. One datapoint that will be scrutinized is the JOLTS data, which showed more job openings than were expected. In addition, a $58 billion auction of 3-year notes saw strong demand, with yields clearing lower than expected, indicating good appetite for shorter-term debt. The 30-year-long bond finished the session on Tuesday at 4.81%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Following Monday’s poor showing, prices across the energy complex were lower for the second day in a row. The song remains the same: abundant supplies, combined with expectations of slowing demand, were the culprit once again. Sector analysts also cited that Iraq restored production at its giant West Qurna 2 oilfield after an export pipeline leak, adding about 460,000 barrels per day to global supply, about 0.5% of world output. Brent Crude was last seen at $62.05, down 0.70% while West Texas Intermediate closed at $58.35, down 0.90%. Natural gas took a beating for the second day running, closing at $4.56, down 7.21% on continued profit taking and weather-related fundamentals. Gold and Silver were higher on Tuesday, as rate-cut expectations provided a tailwind for the precious metals. The big story across the sector was Silver rising to a record high of $60.73 an ounce on strong industrial demand and investor interest. A real shortage of the metal boosted silver prices to record levels, as major mines faced disruptions, limiting supply. Gold was last seen on Tuesday at $4,212, up 0.56%. Crypto trading today on Tuesday showed a generally stable but slightly mixed market, with Bitcoin hovering around $90,000-$93,000, posting small daily gains or dips. At the same time, Ethereum and other major altcoins also experience minor fluctuations, with overall market cap figures fluctuating between $3.1 and $3.2 trillion and increased trading volume for some assets, such as Ethereum. Key themes include Bitcoin defending support near $90k and analysts watching for potential breakouts in specific altcoins, such as ADA. At 4 P.M. EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $93.130, while Ethereum was trading at $3,316. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

PARAMOUNT SENDS LETTER TO WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY SHAREHOLDERS Reiterates why Paramount's offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Reiterates why Paramount's offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares?

Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC.

These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.

No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels).

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions.

Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final").

On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction.

Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results.

Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched.

While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders.

These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels).

To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion.

By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD.

We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels).

WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate.

As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer.

The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us.

Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available.

These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel).

Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming).

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025.

These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media. Paramount's portfolio unites legendary brands, including Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, CBS - America's most-watched broadcast network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, Paramount+, Paramount TV, and Skydance's Animation, Film, Television, Interactive/Games, and Sports divisions.

Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders.

These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025.

These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel).

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available.

Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025).

Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media. Paramount's portfolio unites legendary brands, including Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, CBS - America's most-watched broadcast network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, Paramount+, Paramount TV, and Skydance's Animation, Film, Television, Interactive/Games, and Sports divisions.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD.

Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media. Paramount's portfolio unites legendary brands, including Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, CBS - America's most-watched broadcast network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, Paramount+, Paramount TV, and Skydance's Animation, Film, Television, Interactive/Games, and Sports divisions.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD.

Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media. Paramount's portfolio unites legendary brands, including Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, CBS - America's most-watched broadcast network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, Paramount+, Paramount TV, and Skydance's Animation, Film, Television, Interactive/Games, and Sports divisions.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming).

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025.

Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025.

A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available.

Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Title: 35 Supposed “Luxuries” That Are One Big Giant Scam To Take Rich People’s Money
URL: https://www.demilked.com/luxury-rip-offs/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T13:02:51Z
Full Content:
We often buy into the idea that paying a higher price guarantees a better product. Many of us assume that the more something costs, the better its quality or value. However, luxury industry insiders say this couldn’t be further from the truth. A recent Reddit post asked, “People who work in ‘luxury’ industries (5-star hotels, fine dining, high-end brands): what is a complete rip-off that rich people happily pay for?” The eye-opening responses revealed that premium prices don’t always mean superior quality. In some cases, the wealthy are simply paying for something that boosts their image, as savvy businesspeople know rich folks will happily shell out the big bucks on anything that creates the illusion of exclusivity and wealth. Image source: Nathandg27, Elina Sazonova/Pexels Honestly the markup on wine at fine dining restaurants is insane. i worked as a hostess and watched people drop $300 on bottles we got wholesale for like $40 without even blinking. Image source: Best_Needleworker530, Mizuno K/Pexels Less common but the most vile scam I’ve seen. I worked for a restaurant that wanted to be on a higher income shelf, in the middle of a white men in finance and gilets district. Very popular business breakfast spot. They had a huge oven near the expo and you could see freshly baking sourdough bread. The oven was not actually “baking”, it was set on something like 40 C so the bread was kept nicely warm but definitely not freshly baked. We didn’t even bake it on site, it was delivered in the morning and put in the oven, as a display. If someone ordered “bread and olives” or “charcuterie board” from the menu we would make a whole event of getting that bread out, slicing, arranging and serving. You would then expect any other order that had bread in there to get THIS bread. Yeah, no. Any order, like things containing toast, full English, avo toasts etc had generic Warburtons used. FOH staff had to deal with complaints about it left right and centre. I lasted 3 weeks, the restaurant about a year more after I left. Image source: habilishn, Ron Lach/Pexels If you make your product rare. we are very small olive oil producers, we have all the machines to completely produce the oils ourselves. we work very clean and organic in a way that goes beyond any certificates, so we won’t fool anyone on this side. BUT there is certain special oils, ie. the very early harvest, or oil from wild olive trees. we have some wealthy customers, if we tell them we only have 10L of wild olive oil left, they want to buy it all… only to know that they have it and noone else. so we found ourselves lying sometimes about the amount of oil left, it makes certain rich people buy everything available just to have it 🤷🏻‍♂️. Medical woo. They will pay $200 to put their feet in a little tub of ionized water for 30 minutes while the metals in the water oxidize and turn it a color – THEN they find out which toxins they released based on the color (spoiler alert – it’s always brown/copper). It’s complete and total nonsense and that’s the *cheapest* one I can think of. They’ll drop thousands on stuff like this without a second thought. Image source: Syntra44 Image source: thehonestypolicy, Ron Lach/Pexels My brother works fine dining as a manager. Someone once wanted a sparkler on top of a dessert and the restaurant didn’t want to do it. My brother said “sure we can do that. For $500.” And the person did it. Now they have a box of sparklers available in the kitchen for requests and the restaurant gets $500 a pop. And once one dessert gets the showy sparkler walked through the dining room, past all the other couples celebrating or bachelorette parties or people who won big (it’s at a casino), then EVERYONE wants to get a sparkler. Blows my mind. Image source: UglyT, JESHOOTS.com/Pexels I once DJ’d in a casino in Macau. The VIP tables would competitively send bottles of champagne to each other’s tables just to signal their wealth. It would be announced over the PA system, but nobody would get the champagne. The bottles never actually existed! It would be like “Table 10 sends 5 bottles of champagne to Table 4” “Table 4 is sending 15 bottles of champagne to Table 10” “Table 10 is sending 30 bottles of champagne to Table 4” Etc Etc This kept on going until they were up to like 200 bottles of champagne. They weren’t friends or anything – they were just showing their wealth off to this other table. They got a few symbolic bottles with indoor fireworks taken to the table by girls, but that’s it. I asked the owner what it was about and he said they can pick them up on another day if they want, but nobody ever does – it’s purely for show. Insane. Image source: HemlockHex, Inga Seliverstova/Pexels I do high end cocktail bartending. One of the rules I live by is that the difference in a $11 and a $30 drink is purely presentation. The glass needs to be immaculately polished, the ice needs to be in good condition, and the garnish needs to be skillfully prepared. Additionally, you need the right space to sell $30 drinks, you need clean surfaces and enough hands to ensure a consistently pre-bussed bar-top. All of that has zilch to do with how good the drink actually tastes. It’s the real problem with most bartenders, I find. Making delicious drinks is important, but presentability is what sets the price tag and perceived value. Image source: transemacabre, Jose Ricardo Barraza Morachis/Pexels One of the more interesting ones is having expensive replicas made of priceless jewelry in case of theft. My surrogate dad in Nassau county, Long Island knows of people who spent thousands and thousands of dollars on “costume” dupes of their best jewelry so they can wear that out and leave the real stuff at home under lock and key. Imagine a set of costume jewelry worth more than your vehicle. That sort of thing. Image source: Wild-Vast-2559, Anıl Karakaya/Pexels I work for a high-end plumbing company. We do some truly enormous new residential builds. The difference between regular and high end plumbing is purely aesthetic. All our pipes are meticulously organized and ran with non-flexible materials. We essentially do satisfying cable management but for pipes. It looks nice and wealthy customers like nice looking things. . Image source: yournorthernbuddy, Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels Dignity, as a valet at a billionaire hangout we had all sorts of regulars that would pay (to us) ridiculous amounts in an attempt to embarrass us. A notable one is the fellow who came in with a $100 bill about once a week and asked me to tie his shoes. He’d step out of his Rolls Royce Cullinan with one shoe untied and money in hand. As best we could tell, it was to demean us into servants’ tasks or whatever, but really it’s a pittance to him but equal to 8 hours labor for me. So we always did it. Image source: triple_hoop, Omotayo Samuel/Pexels The “VIP Lounge access” in night clubs , it’s basically milking a person with low self esteem. Image source: BasenjiMaster, Anna Tarazevich/Pexels Gold flakes on things. My ex worked in the hotel industry. The rich would buy anything that sounded or presented itself as expensive. Gold flakes are really cheap, they put that on/in anything and they can up the price 3x or more. Image source: JaxyKun, RDNE Stock project/Pexels Private jet pilot here. Catering services. There’s companies that, for a lack of a better word, cater specifically to the corporate jet world to provide food for the aircraft that is delivered to the fixed base operators for the departure. This is stuff like Asian salads for like 150$ or a club sandwich for 80$. (these are rough estimates based on what our dispatch has told me I’ve never personally ordered them) Many of our part 91 (owner flights) the aircraft owners are watching their expenses closely and as such don’t order these because it’s a ridiculous waste of money to get Panera quality food for 150$ when they could just ask us pilots to pickup Panera for them on the way to the aircraft. The people who don’t realize this or care and will often run up over 1000$ for a handful of salads and sandwiches are those who charter the aircraft and get shafted by these companies or their broker. Image source: Epicfaux, Addilyn Ragsdill @clockworklemon.com/Unsplash Truffle oil. I’ve worked at some crazy high end places, and they’ll often use the same stuff from Spectrum.. whis is not truffle oil as much as it is a gasoline byproduct 🤢 Image source: Legendary_Lamb2020, Ivan S/Pexels I worked construction for a couple years in my 20’s. I was the only white or college educated guy on the crew. It was a regular occurrence while working on wealthy people’s properties that they would request that I personally return for side projects, even though everyone else on the crew was much more skilled and harder working than me. My billionaire real estate client was having me go back and forth with the selling realtor on a property over a $10k difference in what he wanted to pay on a multi million dollar vacant lot. He made a point of telling me he and his wife were sipping a $10k bottle of port while having me work around over 10k on the property. Also the most unhappy client Ive ever had. Rich and unhappy ain’t no way to live. Image source: Rockchef Image source: CapnGrundlestamp, AJ Ahamad/Pexels The mini bar. They’ll drink and eat everything in there without a second thought. $27 bottle of water? Well they’re rich and thirsty. I used to book hotel rooms for Disney. The El Capitan Suite at the Grand Californian Hotel runs about $10,000 a night. Don’t get me wrong, it’s an extremely beautiful suite with top-tier everything, but it will never be anything but crazy and wasteful to spend $10,000 for the privilege of sleeping in a room. Image source: RilohKeen Image source: EuphoricEditor5133, Shots by Sandhu/Pexels The “exclusive” hotel car service is wild… it’s literally a regular suv with a logo and they upcharge like it’s a chauffeured spaceship. Turn-down service in ultra‑luxury hotels is one of the biggest ones. It’s basically someone folding the corner of your blanket, dimming a light, and leaving a chocolate, yet it gets bundled into rooms that cost hundreds more per night. People love it I guess because it feels exclusive, not because it actually does anything. Image source: throwawayjaaay Image source: TJayClark, Andrea Piacquadio/Pexels Hotels The difference between a $75 room and $150-200 room is usually massive The difference between a $200 room and a $800+ room is a lot of small things that most people like, but wouldn’t spent $600+ on. Image source: LessBig715, Lukas/Pexels Catering that they don’t even eat. My wife works at an FBO at PBI. It’s where the Uber rich land their private jets. They order all this really good food that goes untouched. All in individual containers wrapped up. I’m talking thick cuts of prime rib, vegetables, mash potatoes all in one container. Lucky for me, the food that wasn’t opened gets split up with my wife and her coworkers. You wouldn’t believe some of the stuff these rich people leave behind. Several months ago my wife came home with one of those big Yeti cooler bags, the thing is over $400, and it was left. I have worked in high end retail for a decade at several well known luxury companies. Most of the time, I will be honest with clients, but sometimes we make truly ugly items that rich people fawn over. If they’re in love with it, even though I think it’s ugly, I will talk it up. Afterwards, we’ll talk among ourselves and say rich people will buy anything. Also employees in these luxury brands 99% of the time, never pay full price. We trade discounts with each other. A personal opinion of mine is that Louis Vuitton is over hyped and not worth the money. You can get something more unique at another brand. They also pay their employees the lowest of any high end brand. I struggle to even call them a luxury brand with how completely oversaturated their market is, and also the fact that their most popular canvas bags are actually just plastic (looking at you, Never Full tote). Image source: genghis-san Image source: lefund, Ron Lach/Pexels Clothing industry here. People will blindly play a premium for items made in certain countries because they believe anything made in _______ is so much better than anywhere else Truth is country of manufacture means very little compared to what factory/workshop it’s made in Portugal, Turkey, Bosnia, Romania and Moldova are generally considered countries with high quality control standards, good wages and actually having talented craftsmen Truth is that Portugal and Turkey are significantly cheaper to manufacture a tee shirt/hoodie than Italy, Spain, France or UK because they produce so many plus they have lower taxes for corporations. As for Bosnia, Romania and Moldova (in a lot of cases Turkey too) this is where the “sweatshops” of Europe operate. Their labour is significantly cheaper than other European countries and theres less things they are legally required to provide to workers so they can get away paying someone half or less than they’d get in Italy or UK. Because of this you also see way less skilled workers and it’s more like an assembly line that you’d find in an Asian or Latin American country. Also it’s not as expensive as people think to even produce in the good countries. Zara, Topman and many other mall brands have lines made in Turkey, Portugal or Peru (all countries known for really good cotton). Truth is the cost to make a tee there ranges from $3.50-20 generally depending how many you make and choice of material + print process. It’s nothing crazy and the rest is markup. Whether you want to pay the premium for the look or brand is up to you but for example Pangaia and Givenchy tee/hoodies are produced in the same Portuguese workshop. Pangaia averages around $50usd a tee while Givenchy is $700usd. While Givenchy does use nicer fabric and a more luxurious finishing overall you’re really looking at a tee that costs $8 to make vs one that costs probably $14. The Givenchy markup is all because it’s luxury/exclusive and they market as that Tied into this, some countries that get a bad wrap (China, India and Mexico mainly) aren’t always bad. China for example is really good at technical clothing like windbreakers and sportswear + plastic and acetate eyewear. Mexico makes really good leather shoes and boots. India is great at intricate woven fabrics. A lot of companies will produce in these countries because they have the set up to do these things on a large scale and would be significantly cheaper + faster to produce than to do the same thing in a more “reputable” place like the USA, would be equal or better quality too Judge every product/brand on a case by case basis and don’t generalize anything just because of the country it’s made in. I worked in a five star hotel and the biggest rip off was bottled water service. We would charge absurd amounts for a brand you could get at any store. Guests acted like it tasted different because it came with a cold towel and a smile lol. Image source: CutiePieDol Image source: Super_Commercial9195, Luna Lovegood/Pexels Work in fine dining as a cook. Sure the $80 steaks are a thing and so is a $20 creme brulee. But probably the thing that’s the biggest ripoff that sells like gangbusters is the up to $180 charcuterie board. Yes it looks pretty and has very expensive meat and cheese on it but it’s mostly filled out with nuts pickled veg and crustini and a few dips. In all on that board there’s maybe $15 or $20 worth of product and it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to assemble each (after the meats are sliced but that’s all done in prep in the afternoon.) The margins on that are better than even most alcohol save perhaps nice wine. People love their chart ( pronunciation shart) and just pay out the nose for it. Fours sharts coming right up. . Former luxury hotel room service coordinator (answered phones, did office work) here. All the food, but particularly booze. The markup is INSANE. Pro baseball players like (lots and lots of) cheap beer and will pay 3x for it after we basically grab it from the grocery store down the block to emergency restock after they drink it all. Don’t even get me started on the liquor – absolutely eye watering price-per-shot even for the crappy stuff (and we could tell who knew what they were doing vs. who was ordering what they thought was fancy, but they all overpaid). But the worst is honestly what people *didn’t* pay for. There’s something so odious about giving super rich people free stuff. I’m sitting there barely able to afford to eat, working 40+ hours per week, comping drinks and sending out elaborate free amenities to people who are spending more for their stay than I make in month. Image source: Princess_Zelda_Fitzg Image source: theRealHalIncandenza, Godisable Jacob/Pexels I worked in luxury fashion . Not sure if this is relevant but I’ve seen hundreds of thousands in actual cash spent on purses. I worked at Celine and was even offered a job in France at one point. We had an alligator purse that at the time was priced at 35k $ . Had two in stock. Sold one to a Saudi Royal family member . They came in and shut the store down. We were all called to the floor . The Saudi family had a black truck deliver two gym bags full of American cash . Hundreds of thousands. My store manager and her assistant were busy running bills through the counter . Family left spending nearly a quarter million on purses and jackets from Celine. Image source: onyxS4int, Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels Caskets and urns, I work in a fancier funeral home as support staff (not a director). We literally sell $80 urns imported from India for $600+. A $2000 casket goes for $8000. Remember that you are allowed under federal law to bring your own urn or casket. Sometimes I feel like there is more financial flexing at funerals than at weddings. Image source: Martin0994, Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels Travelling during peak season. That $1800 room sells for $400 in the fall. I want to say room service, but it’s a pure lazy tax. You pay that same lazy tax when you use Uber Eats. IME, you get what you pay for. Certain properties in certain markets might have a specific thing that gets you, but generally you can get what you’re paying for. Image source: Scrimps, Shots by Sandhu/Pexels Clothing. The average rich person is not buying Bespoke clothes. They are paying $300 for a hoodie that costs $7 to produce. Often in the same factory that produces clothing for mass market retailers. I know someone who owns (family) a small factory who has had a Canada Goose contract for well over a decade. Even an extremely complex and complicated jacket like those from Canada Goose, which are some of the most complicated garments produced on a large scale. Costs around $95 each, even accounting for Canadian wages. Image source: Separate-Command1993, John Taran/Pexels I’m a high end AV Engineer, think 150k+ speakers and home theaters/smart house stuff. People will pay THOUSANDS of dollars for speaker wire that is twisted a certain number of times in a certain configuration that’s supposed to prevent EMI and improve sound quality. It’s all BS to a degree, the human ear can’t hear the differences. Image source: anon, Szymon Shields/Pexels Cook here! I’ve worked fine dining exclusively, for over a decade. Mostly country clubs, currently at a high end hotel chain with locations in multiple countries. Everything on the menu. It’s everything. We mark up everything to such an insane degree that the kitchen staff alone account for half the luxury vehicles in the front lot. You paid 176 (ish) USD over wholesale for that caviar, so the dishwasher can drive a G Wagon. We can charge 6 dollars for a fried egg because we say so. You could buy a dozen eggs for the price of one fried egg at a luxury hotel. Its not a special egg. It’s the same brand as the diner down the street. I’ve been there. I’ve seen the eggs they use. You could probably get 3 eggs there, for the same price as the one egg I will make you. I will make you a 47 dollar burger that uses the same beef and the same buns as a sit down burger place. Our food is not priced to be reasonable. It’s priced the way it is, *exclusively because we can*. Some of the people I serve are so wealthy that they don’t even ask for a bill. They just charge it to their room, with no concern for how much they’ve spent. We had a lady a couple days ago, who ordered a gorgeous tomahawk ribeye for her dogs to share. They didn’t like it. She threw it away, and just shook her head at her dogs. I know because I asked like I cared about her dogs preference. We have a once a year regular. Pretty sure homie is one of those people who is so wealthy that he doesn’t exist in our mortal realm, like his world is his own, and his alone. He comes in like he is a regular dude with disposable income. Wears New Balance sneakers, Kirkland khakis, and a polo. Single suitcase, no fanfare. He orders all of his food basically free style. Nothing is ever *off* the menu to him. 4 egg whites (6 dollars each), fine herbs (I think we charge like 5 bucks), brie (depends on what we have on hand, but let’s say 10 bucks a serving), braised beef cheek (a dinner item we always have. He pays full price of 62.99), and a side of fruit (10 bucks). This is what he eats both mornings he is here, every single summer, like clockwork. He drinks two double Kettle One Caesars, sometimes a Latte, and leaves a generous tip. Usually his breakfast comes out to a couple hundred dollars, more if he has company. Its all really worth maybe 50 bucks. At absolute best. Our food is very good, but we are catering to people who don’t just have disposable income, they have incomparable amounts of income, and we take full advantage of that. We feel no guilt for this, because they never ever ever complain. Bottle service at a nightclub. Imagine paying a 1000% markup on a bottle of Grey Goose that typically costs $50.

They dress it up with sauce and fancy presentation, but just know that your Chicken Cordon Bleu came from a box. Same with your fancy dessert UNLESS the 5-star has a designated pastry chef. Many don’t. It’s all in the name of lowering Food Cost. (disclosure: I’ve worked as an accountant in resort hospitality for over 20 yrs. We know what gets purchased and carried in inventory.)

Title: Inside tractor maker CNH’s push to bring more artificial intelligence to the farm
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/10/artificial-intelligence-cnh-ai-tractors-farm-equipment/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jay Schroeder, the chief technology officer of CNH, was recently in Brazil, discussing artificial intelligence use cases to support the company’s research and development team. The agricultural equipment maker has put a lot of effort into governance and assessing certified tools from vendors, but the actual application of the technology within its own research division remains very nascent. What has held Schroeder back, he says, are lingering concerns about the return on investment of AI. He cites an MIT study published over the summer that found that 95% of AI pilots fail. “It’s great that we’ve got people engaged in AI,” says Schroeder, who quickly pivots to ask rhetorically, “How do we measure success? What are the things that we can measure to say, ‘This has been a worthwhile investment for CNH?’” Schroeder, a three-decade veteran of CNH who began his career as an engineer focused on mid-range tractor transmission design, isn’t completely cautious when it comes to leveraging AI. The tech has been deployed across broad corners of the business including software development, to assist with drafting contracts, producing R&D database queries, and content management. CNH has scored some wins that Schroeder has been able to track. The company is leaning on AI to assist software engineers who are focused on precision agricultural technology and the FieldOps farm management systems, where AI, machine learning, and sensors are applied to digitally enhance farming. Early data has shown that these engineers are reducing the time needed for documentation by 60%, giving them more time to write new code. Another project underway involves AI-enabled spraying systems that use cameras and machine learning to detect the difference between weeds and planted crops when applying chemicals in the field. Farmers who use AI in this manner can reduce the amount of herbicides they use by 80%. Other applications have more nebulous gains. CNH’s engineers participated in a pilot program where they were able to use AI to pull field reports from dispersed datasets across the company. Within three minutes, this generative AI tool can produce a report that includes details about a design project, CNH’s standards for developing the gear, field test reports, and other key information. “Can you measure that?” asks Schroeder. He says that many hours are being saved from the work that would have gone into developing one of those reports manually in the past. But putting an exact figure on the time savings is more difficult. Investments in AI and other emerging technologies, like autonomous robots, have become central to the pitch made by CNH and other tractor suppliers as farmers face intense cost pressures and feelthe dire effects of climate change. In the United Kingdom, where the Dutch-incorporated CNH has its headquarters and main operations, heat and drought led to around $1 billion in lost production this year. Three of the five worst harvests in the history of the U.K. have occurred since 2020, according to the figures from the U.K.-based nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. Only 3% of the world’s land is suitable for crops, but the global population is growing by 35 million each year, according to CNH. Farmers have to squeeze out more efficiencies in the field to meet that rising demand. “The biggest impact on a farmer’s profitability is the yield, besides commodity prices, obviously,” says Gerrit Marx, CEO of CNH, which ranks No. 217 on the Fortune 500 Europe. “In the end, we want to help the farmer make better decisions.” Farm-equipment suppliers have been squeezed by the impact of tariffs, which has led to weakening demand for their expensive tractors, combines, and harvesters. Last month, CNH reported weaker year-over-year sales for the company’s third quarter, as shipments slowed to dealers that have been working their way through excess inventories. But even as it faces those headwinds, CNH has vowed to invest nearly $5 billion over five years into its U.S. manufacturing and R&D facilities. “The solutions we’re developing for AG [agriculture] are really helping to feed the world,” says Schroeder. “I grew up on a family farm…so for me, it’s personal.” CNH’s primary technology partner is Microsoft, and the company has been in active conversations with the tech giant to deploy some AI tools to support precision-technology product development. Already, all CNH employees have access to the free, web-based version of Microsoft Copilot, and about 1,000 of the “AI power users” have access to the premium license. The company’s precision agricultural tech AI projects, Schroeder says, are still “mostly in the pilot phase. We have a long hill to climb.” One AI tool that CNH launched externally at the beginning of 2025 is the “AI Tech Assistant,” which was deployed to hundreds of agricultural and construction dealer groups to field questions about any issues for CNH-branded machinery and propose a repair plan. Marx says that every member of CNH’s global leadership team is running at least one generative or agentic AI pilot program within their respective fields. He says CNH is looking for tangible benefits to business outcomes. One area of increased focus is the application of generative AI to produce conversational, real-time insights that can connect the dots between the seeds, fertilizers, and equipment a farmer has at their disposal, as well as current and near-future weather patterns, to help improve crop management and planning. “Tomorrow, the agronomist will become a set of agentic AIs that help the farmer to make bigger decisions better,” says Marx. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The emerging federal-versus-state battle to regulate AI. In the wake of around 100 different laws adopted by 38 states during this year’s legislative session, President Trump this week moved to issue an executive order that would aim to prevent state's from passing laws restricting AI. Over-regulating AI, Trump and his allies believe, will make it harder for the U.S. to compete with China. But state governors have expressed fears about the impact of AI—on hiring and employment, consumer protection, fraud, and other risks—motivating them to act in absence of federal regulations. Nvidia wins Trump’s blessing to sell AI chips in China. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he had granted Nvidia permission to sell the company’s H200 AI chip to China, giving the AI chip maker an opportunity to chase billions in orders from the market that would purportedly only go to “approved customers.” But, the Financial Timesreported that China would limit access to H200 chips and that buyers would likely need to go through an approval process that would require them to explain why domestic providers are unable to meet their needs. Nike cuts CTO role; Deere CIO retires. Athletic-gear giant Nike has eliminated two C-suite roles, including the CTO position, as CEO Elliott Hill aims to eliminate “layers” to accelerate a turnaround plan. CTO Muge Dogan is departing after just two years in the role. She previously spent more than 16 years at Amazon. Meanwhile, Deere & Co. announced that CIO Raj Kalathur would retire in January after 28 years at the agricultural machinery manufacturer. Kalathur has served as CIO since 2019 and oversaw Deere’s IT function and John Deere Financial, the financial-services provider for dealers and customers that buy the company’s equipment. Deere didn’t provide further details on who would succeed Kalathur. IBM scoops up Confluent for $11 billion. Shares of data-streaming platform Confluent jumped after the company agreed to a $31-per-share cash takeover offer from IBM. It's one of the tech giant’s largest takeovers ever in a deal that will bolster its AI offerings. IBM says that it expects that global data demand will more than double by 2028 and asserts that the IBM-Confluent combination will enable better and faster deployment of generative and agentic AI. As Bloomberg reports, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has led efforts to reposition the company’s business around selling AI-related services to clients and buying up software companies. Those efforts appear to be paying off, with around 80% of IBM’s 300 clients who buy AI products being new over the past two quarters, IBM told the Wall Street Journal when it reported earnings in October. New York Times, Chicago Tribune sue Perplexity. The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have sued Perplexity, saying the AI startup is copying and distributing their exclusive content. This adds to a growing list of more than 40 court cases in the U.S. in which copyright holders have sued AI companies, the Times reports. The Times was also in court last week for its ongoing litigation with OpenAI, with the latter suffering a legal blow after a federal judge ruled that the ChatGPT maker must produce millions of anonymized chat logs from its users in a copyright case that stems from a late 2023 lawsuit by the news organization. EY says that AI-driven gains are being pumped into reinvestment, not job cuts. While headlines continue to swirl around AI's impact on jobs—including the recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas that AI has been responsible for nearly 55,000 job layoffs in 2025—consulting giant EY is making the case that savings in AI are far more likely to be poured back into the business. Nearly all business leaders (96%) report AI-driven gains in productivity, but they are far more focused on reinvesting than eliminating jobs. When asked what they've done with the dollars saved from AI, these leaders report spending to support existing AI capabilities (47%), develop new AI capabilities (42%), strengthen cybersecurity (41%), invest in R&D (39%), and upskilling and reskilling employees (38%), according to consulting giant EY’s fourth AI Pulse Survey. Only 17% report those gains led to reduced headcount. “We see that a lot of companies are coming back with positive returns and are getting even more bullish in what their investment theses are,” Dan Diasio, EY global consulting AI leader, tells Fortune. “More of those executives are putting more capital towards AI, many of them doubling what their investments were over the course of the next 12 months.” The EY survey data aligns with Diasio's thinking. About 27% of respondents currently commits a quarter or more of their IT budget to AI, but that share of respondents is projected to nearly double to 52% in 2026. The group that spends half or more of their IT budget on AI is expected to quintuple, to 19% next year from just 3% today.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

Title: What Hollywood's real-life drama means for you

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you? Americans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and "Game of Thrones." The headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants. The reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies. "If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now," said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics. Now that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in "synergies" that will likely result in cuts. "The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is," said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers. Additionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle. It all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels. Whoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said. "Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions," he said. It's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made. "This is one less entity writing checks," said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning "The Favourite." Paramount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017. The dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%). That's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models. "The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form," Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said. Jump to

Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Big Tech’s so-called Magnificent Seven are on everyone’s lips. The exorbitant stock market valuations of Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla provoke an amalgam of awe and fear. Their trillion-dollar investments in AI prompt some to predict the brightest of futures and others to dread humanity’s dumbing down, unemployment, redundancy even. In this overwhelming din, it is easy to miss the larger picture: a new type of capital is killing markets, capitalism’s habitat. At its very beginning, capitalism was underpinned by faith in competitive markets. In the liberal fantasy, spearheaded by Adam Smith, bakers, brewers and butchers laboured within markets so cut-throat that none could make more money than the bare minimum necessary to keep their small, family-owned businesses running. This in turn provided us with our daily bread, ale and meat. Then came the second industrial revolution and the conglomerates whose market power would make Smith weep with joy. This was the era of Big Business and the “robber barons”. And so another — neoliberal — fantasy was created, to justify the new big beasts that were now monopolising almost every market that mattered. Joseph Schumpeter, a former Austrian finance minister who made America his home, was the new creed’s most effective advocate. Progress, he argued, is impossible in competitive markets. Growth needs monopolies to fuel it. How else can enough profit be earned to pay for expensive research and development, for new machines, new product lines and all the paraphernalia that helps innovation take root? To monopolise markets, conglomerates need to dazzle us with remarkable new products that kill off the competition, like Henry Ford’s Model-T or Apple’s iPhone. Should we worry about all that concentrated power? No, Schumpeter reassured us. Once they reach their pinnacle, these monopolies get flabby and complacent and, eventually, they’re brought down by some upstart: one example being Toyota’s toppling of General Motors. More recently, Peter Thiel, Palantir’s co-founder, said something that many thought was a restatement of Schumpeter’s dictum: “Competition is for losers!” While the pioneers of Big Business like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would have agreed wholeheartedly, what Thiel was implying went beyond their wildest imagination. It went much further even than Schumpeter’s pseudo-Darwinian idea that progress comes through the rise and fall of monopolists in an endless struggle for existence. What Thiel was saying is that today, winners do not just kill off the competition to monopolise a market. No, they keep going until they kill the market itself and replace it with something quite different: a kind of cloud fief that lacks all of the ingredients of a proper market — indeed that lacks all of the advantages that liberals and neoliberals alike recognise in the machinery of decentralised markets. In fact, today’s winners —the Magnificent Seven, plus Thiel’s own Palantir — are reviving an economic model that all of us thought dead and buried after the fall of the Soviet Union: economic planning systems that match buyers and sellers outside anything that can be usefully described as a market. By Yanis Varoufakis Gosplan was the Soviet Union’s State Planning Committee, the engine room of its command economy. Its remit was to match the supply and demand of critical resources (oil, steel, cement) but also consumption goods (food, clothes, appliances), without using market prices. Once buyers and sellers were matched, prices were assigned with a view to achieving political and social objectives (such as to ensure basic affordability, or subsidise certain industries) — not to balance markets. Gosplan was disbanded immediately after the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin on Boxing Day of 1991, but it is now back. Where? In the algorithms powering Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, Peter Thiel’s Palantir and the rest of Big Tech’s digital platforms that pretend to be, but are not, markets. Before you protest the audacity of my claim, think of what happens when you visit Amazon. Unlike when you visit a shopping mall, either with friends or mingling with strangers, the moment you follow the link to amazon.com, you exit the marketplace and enter a space of pristine isolation. It’s just you and Jeff Bezos’s algorithm. You type, say, “espresso machines” into the search box and the algorithm matches you with a number of vendors. However, to achieve what it was coded for, the algorithm had started working months, even years, earlier. Over that period, you will have revealed to it many of your whims and desires through your searches, purchases, clicks and reviews. Using these cues, as well as data from other sources, the algorithm has trained you to train it to know you even better, enabling it to advise you on what books, music and films to buy. It has already won your trust. So, now that you are in a hurry to replace your broken espresso machine, the chances are that you will choose one of the top search results it has given you. The algorithm knows your spending pattern. It knows how to guide you to the espresso machine with the highest price you are prepared to pay, all in order that Amazon can collect up to 40% of it the moment you click the purchase button. It is an extortionate cut, but the espresso machine’s makers tolerate it, because they know that if they don’t, their company will never appear in the top search results of anyone prepared to pay for their product. As AI improves, this power to manipulate your behaviour increases — and this is why Big Tech’s valuations are going through the roof. This is nothing less than a capitalist, privately-owned, super high-tech reincarnation of the USSR’s Gosplan. Amazon’s software matches you with particular vendors and bans you from talking to any seller or even from observing what other buyers are doing — unless of course it calculates that it serves its own purposes to let you see a small selection of them. As for the price you pay, this follows (rather than precipitates) your being matched with a seller. Rather than being the variable that equilibrates demand with supply, prices in Amazon fulfil another role: that of maximising Jeff Bezos’s cloud rents. In this sense, prices in Amazon and other Big Tech platforms function in a manner far closer to Gosplan than to any farmers’ market, money market or shopping mall you have ever experienced. In fact, had the Soviet leaders lived to witness the workings of Silicon Valley’s Big Tech, they would be kicking themselves, lamenting that it was American capitalists who perfected their Gosplan model, complete with a surveillance system that would make their KGB henchmen green with envy. Gosplan failed to turn into a success story as it lacked Big Tech’s greatest weapon: cloud capital, that is, the algorithms, data centres and optic fibre cables working as an integrated network to train you to train it. As you impart your data, cloud capital learns how to input desires into your mind and then satiate these desires by selling you stuff within its privately owned version of Gosplan. But, is there really a difference — I hear many of you ask loudly — between Thomas Edison and Jeff Bezos? Are they not cut from the same cloth of megalomaniac monopolists seeking to dominate markets and our imagination? Yes, despite their similarities, there is a difference — and it is gigantic. Edison’s and Ford’s capital was productive. It produced cars, electricity, turbines. Bezos’s cloud capital produces nothing, except the enormous power to encase us in his cloud fief where traditional capitalist producers are squeezed for cloud rents and we, the users, provide our free labour. With every click, like and review, we enhance the power of cloud capital. Once upon a time, an old Trotskyite told me that the Soviet Union, in the name of socialism, had created a form of industrial feudalism. Independent of whether he was right or not, his comment is pertinent today in relation to Big Tech. Come to think of it, while the trading process on platforms like Amazon is reminiscent of the USSR’s Gosplan mechanism, it is also the case that the enormous sums that Amazon, Uber, Airbnb etc, charge the actual producers of the goods and services peddled on their sites are akin to the ground rents that the landed gentry used to charge their vassals — except that, here, they are cloud rents that accrue to the owners of cloud capital. So, just as the Soviet Union generated one kind of feudalism in the name of socialism and human emancipation, today, Silicon Valley is generating another kind of feudalism — technofeudalism, I have called it — in the name of capitalism and free markets. By Joel Day The parallel extends to the state. The USSR was meant to be a workers’ paradise in contrast to the USA whose raison d’être was to be a haven for capitalist producers. It turns out that both promises were false. As Big Tech’s cloud capital accumulates and concentrates into fewer and fewer hands, states are becoming dependent on corporate techlords. By outsourcing core functions — archives, health data, even military software — to rented cloud infrastructure, governments lease back their own operational capacity from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google. This dependency enables a new dimension of technofeudal power. From this perspective, just as the Soviet Union was a feudal-like industrial society pretending to be a workers’ state, the United States today is performing a splendid impersonation of a technofeudal state, with repercussions that extend to every realm of state activity, including health services, education, the tax office, our borders and faraway battlefields. In Ukraine and Gaza, and along our militarised borders, cloud capital is trained to extend its reach. Amazon’s AI tool Rekognition is used by law enforcement, including ICE, while Palantir’s vast surveillance software runs on Amazon’s cloud. Through Project Nimbus, Amazon and Google provide the Israeli military with advanced cloud and AI capabilities, reportedly enabling rapid, AI-driven targeting in Gaza with minimal human oversight. Let us briefly return to the comparison with the early 20th century’s original monopolist capitalists. Whether we admire or abhor the Magnificent Seven’s stock market valuations, it is helpful to keep this in mind: the old capitalist giants, the “robber barons”, actually produced things. The new technofeudal lords produce a new social order. They have replaced the invisible hand of the market with the visible, algorithmic fist of the cloudalist. Free-market enthusiasts have nothing to celebrate and much to regret. But it will take a brave soul amongst them to stare reality in the face. Just like pro-Soviet Marxists remained in denial that the Soviet experiment had failed for many years after 1991, so free-market ideologues refuse to see that capitalism begat a form of capital — cloud capital — that replaced markets with something out of the Soviet past. In the process, it has killed capitalism. Yanis Varoufakis is an economist and former Greek Minister of Finance. He is the author of several best-selling books, most recently Technofeudalism: What killed capitalism.

Title: Pay cuts, poaching, and pivoting: Inside Scale AI after Meta
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/pay-cuts-poaching-pivoting-inside-scale-ai-meta-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:11:01Z
Full Content:
This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim. "Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months," ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. "Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over." The contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb. The chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele. The vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Activity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider. Joe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. "This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig. The company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal. Some investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point. Other investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. "It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him," he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back. On another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation. If the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a "zombie" after being invested in by a tech giant. This summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go. Osborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is. Those weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields. Osborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce. Meanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation. Mercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies. One Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.) Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. "Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality," Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at "record highs." It's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. "Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business," she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September. Scale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. "We take data security seriously," Osborne said. "We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems." Sloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being "suspected spammers," "cheaters," with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like "Good and Bad Folks" and "suspicious non-US taskers." Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been. The company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out. Charles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

December 10, 2025 04:10 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Nematicides Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Global Nematicides Market, valued at USD 1.87 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.51% to reach USD 3.05 Billion by 2030. Nematicides are chemical or biological agents developed to control plant-parasitic nematodes that severely damage crops by attacking root systems. Market growth is strongly driven by the need to reduce crop losses and increase food security as global demand rises. Key Market Drivers: The persistent global challenge of declining arable land: Declining arable land worldwide significantly increases reliance on nematicides to maximize productivity from existing farmland. With global population growth and limited land resources, protecting yields becomes essential. FAOSTAT Analytical Brief 107 reported in June 2025 that cropland per capita decreased by about 20%, from 0.24 to 0.19 hectares between 2001 and 2023, intensifying the need for nematicides to prevent nematode-related yield losses. Simultaneously, rising consumer demand for organic and sustainably produced food is reshaping the market, accelerating the shift toward bio-based nematicides. According to IFOAM and FiBL's 2025 yearbook, global organic farmland grew by 2.5 million hectares in 2023, reaching nearly 99 million hectares. This growth supports the adoption of biological nematicides. The broader pesticide and agricultural chemicals market, including nematicides, is projected to grow from USD 102.9 billion in 2023 to USD 169.8 billion by 2028, as reported by Infosys in its 2024 Agri-chem Industry Outlook. Key Market Challenges: Stringent regulatory frameworks and increasing environmental concerns regarding the residual effects of certain synthetic nematicides: Strict regulations and rising environmental concerns surrounding synthetic nematicides significantly hinder market growth. Rigorous testing, lengthy approval processes, and compliance requirements increase development costs and extend timelines, reducing incentives to invest in new chemical active ingredients. According to CropLife Australia (2024), developing a new crop protection chemical now exceeds USD 300 million and typically requires more than 12 years due to extensive environmental and toxicology data requirements. Regulatory withdrawals also limit farmers' access to critical active ingredients. CropLife Africa Middle East (2023) reported that maize pest control tools could face a 75% reduction and coffee pest tools a 58% reduction in Kenya due to EU-driven restrictions. These challenges constrain product portfolios and restrict overall market growth. Key Market Trends: The integration of precision agriculture technologies into nematicide application: Precision agriculture is increasingly shaping nematicide use by enabling more efficient, targeted application through GPS-guided systems, remote sensing, and variable-rate technologies. These tools reduce waste, improve application accuracy, and enhance crop health while minimizing environmental impact. According to the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (January 2025), Variable Rate Technology adoption in the U.S. increased by 69% across major commodity crops, reflecting the growing reliance on data-driven input management. Strategic collaborations across agrochemical companies, biotech firms, and research institutions are also accelerating innovation in advanced nematicide solutions, particularly biological products. For example, Bayer and Kimitec's June 2025 launch of Ambition Complete Gen2 and Ambition Secure Gen2 demonstrates how alliances expedite the development of next-generation biological nematicides and broaden market offerings.

Title: AI is driving a workforce transformation

Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:00:00Z

Getty Images The rapid influx of AI in its various forms is inevitably leading to workforce transformation. What is less clear is exactly how the transformation will play out. AI is a factor in several recent layoffs at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other companies. However, there's evidence that while AI may affect jobs that require manual or routine labor, it will also spur job growth and productivity gains. There appears to be little doubt AI will be an integral part of workers' lives going forward. According to research presented at the Gartner IT Symposium in October, a survey of CIOs by Gartner indicates that by 2030, they expect 0% of IT work will be done by humans without AI, 75% will be done by humans augmented with AI and 25% will be done by AI alone. TechTarget spoke with Graig Paglieri, CEO of Randstad Digital, about the changing nature of the workforce. Randstad Digital, a division of the Netherlands-based global staffing company Randstad, focuses on providing workers to meet the digital transformation needs of enterprises. The firm operates across four vertical areas -- customer experience, cloud and infrastructure, data and analytics, and product engineering. Paglieri discusses how the AI transformation is affecting jobs and some of the characteristics of the Gen Z generation that's currently entering the workforce. Editor's note: The following transcript was edited for length and clarity. How do you view the current workforce transformation? For example, Gartner research indicates that 0% of work will be done without AI help by 2030, and 25% will be done by AI agents alone. Graig Paglieri: I agree with those proportions and ratios. We're already seeing it significantly in developer roles. It's not that they're completely going away and being replaced by agents, but instead of a company needing four or five developers, they need one or two. There's definitely that augmented agent support. The shift toward components of tech modernization that can be outsourced to an agent is the roadmap. There's evidence that many jobs will be lost to AI, but we also hear that AI will create other jobs. What are you seeing? Paglieri: There's going to be both. There are going to be jobs that are lost, and there will be challenges around upskilling and repurposing some roles. But companies that are ahead of the game are going to transform the way they operate with AI in mind. For example, internally, our recruiting function has been tech-enabled for many years, but with agentic AI and the move to more platform capabilities, the recruiter role will shift. We're not going to need recruiters trying to find people on a job board, source them, match them and see if they're available. All of that can be done through AI technology. But can [the recruiters] do a better job of advising the talent that's been identified on the right role? Can they manage their onboarding? Can they help redeploy them to their next assignment? Those are a lot of the services and functions that get lost today because so much time is spent on the front end dealing with manual, fragmented and cumbersome processes. A significant aspect of the transformation involves Gen Z workers entering the workforce. What are some characteristics of how these workers are being integrated into the workforce? Paglieri: Recent Randstad Digital research shows a small percentage of them -- under 5% -- plan to spend more than 10 years in their company. This can make it challenging, particularly in professional services where it's a big commitment both for the organization and the employee to become productive. They're not recognizing that this is going to take multiple years in phases to develop the skills and capabilities to advance rather than just moving on to the next thing. Flexibility ties into that, too. Forty-five percent of the people we polled said flexibility was the most important factor. Compensation's there, but there's this idea that they're not going to be bogged down by geography and working in the office. Having different, flexible hours is way more important than in past generations. The AI-focused workforce transformation seems to be having a greater effect on entry-level positions. How does the incoming workforce generation deal with that, and how do companies deal with the experience gaps that this will likely produce? Paglieri: This is where the importance of softer skills might come in -- the ability to differentiate and distinguish yourself. The human aspect of your value is more valuable than someone else, where maybe being more technically proficient in the past isn't quite as critical. But it's also where flexibility comes in as well -- taking internships, recognizing that you're not necessarily going to go right into what you thought was your desired field. Are you being flexible enough in finding ways into the workforce? But companies also have to continue to change their expectations and how they're bringing in and onboarding talent, and recognize that there's a need to have balance based on this disruption that's with us. Where is AI affecting the job market now, as some jobs that were hot a few years ago may be going away? What jobs are needed now? Paglieri: First, the economy and market conditions are adding to the dilemma that we're in, so it's not just AI. That has this compounding effect -- AI is creating some disruption and uncertainty, and the macro environment is as weird and wacky as it's ever been. Where is it going? There's a ton of work that needs to be done -- for digital transformation in particular. We're going to see roles such as project managers and business analysts -- which may have slowed down a little bit now because of that AI uncertainty -- pick back up as these engagements need to move faster. That human-in-the-loop with technology role is still critical. Having a foundation in AI skills and some other technical skills is important. What's your overall feeling about the job market in the next few years? Optimism or pessimism? Paglieri: It's definitely optimism. We're in the later stages of the first chapter [of the AI transformation], which starts with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. It also applies to tech services in general. There's been lots of growth, but now there's been a little bit of plateauing. There's still so much digital transformation work that needs to be done that 2026 is going to have a lot more growth opportunity than we've seen in 2025 -- and certainly [more than we] saw in 2024. We're starting to see some early signs of that, and 2027 and 2028 are going to be more productive and positive than 2026.

Title: An AI bubble burst? Early warning signs and how to prepare
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/An-AI-bubble-burst-Early-warning-signs-and-how-to-prepare

KOHb - Getty Images The impending end of an AI bubble could signal a fresh start for some AI technology companies. AI technology has captured the attention of consumers and investors alike due to its rapid innovation and potential for profit, resulting in a surge of AI tools flooding the market. But, despite a wave of innovation, few initiatives made it past the development phase. This was because they were built on fragmented tools and were too disconnected from business goals, according to Juan Jose Lopez Murphy, head of data science at Globant. The situation made some investors uncomfortable. "The frustration we experience, which some call deflation, is fatigue from too many models and too little strategy," Lopez Murphy said. "Instead of investors and executives pulling back completely, we are starting to see a shift of focus from volume to value." Investors are now looking for projects that deliver measurable outcomes that are sustainable across teams and systems, resulting in a more disciplined market, he said. The big difference between what's happening now and previous investment bubbles is that AI technology is real in terms of actual value that it brings, said Matt Hasan, PhD and CEO of aiRESULTS Inc. As an AI strategist and an economist, Hasan said he looks at the market through two lenses -- the technology and the money chasing it. Unrealistic expectations have led to overinvestment in generative AI, and according to an MIT report, 95% of organizations are experiencing zero return. Investment is currently outpacing value. "The risk comes from how fast investors have piled in," Hasan said. "Money is flowing into data centers, chips and startups a lot faster than real adoption can keep up. The hype is moving ahead of actual business value." Three critical factors differentiate this bubble from others, according to Jonathan Bittner, CEO of Dimensional Analytics. Those ways include the following: Forrester predicted an AI market correction in 2026 as organizations grapple with the ever-widening gap between inflated vendor promises and actual value delivered. With fewer than one-third of decision-makers able to tie the value of AI to their organization's financial growth, CEOs will rely on CFOs to approve AI investments based on ROI in 2026, according to the report. "In 2026, the AI hype period ends as the pressure to deliver real, measurable results from secure AI initiative intensifies," Sharyn Leaver, chief research officer at Forrester, said in a report. "As the era of volatility continues, tech and security leaders will be called upon to recalibrate investments under tighter financial scrutiny and governance while navigating increasingly complex geopolitical and economic risks." Hasan has seen some deflation as venture funding cools off, valuations level out and companies realize that promised gains are taking longer to show up. "That's not collapse -- that's a pause to catch our breath," Hasan said. More red flags are visible if you look deeper, Bittner said, including the following: A bubble burst won't kill AI, just the unrealistic expectations surrounding it, Hasan said. He believes that companies focused on solving real problems will emerge stronger. Bittner shares Hasan's optimistic outlook. He said the burst itself would hit organizations in three waves, including the following: "The AI bubble burst could mark the beginning of a healthier, more focused innovation cycle for AI. Enterprises may start consolidating budgets for projects or slow down hypothetical projects," Lopez Murphy said. "This period doesn't mean that innovation is stopping altogether but rather showing maturity in prioritizing projects." He believes that emphasis will shift to building frameworks that will last in the long term. As the threat of an AI bubble burst looms closer, industry leaders will have to see through the hype and focus on AI technology that solves tangible business problems. Hasan advises leaders to stay grounded, tie AI projects to clear results and track costs. "If businesses keep their heads and focus on real impact, a correction won't be a disaster. It'll be a reset, and a healthy one," he said. Bittner added his own recommendations, including the following: For Hasan and Bittner a bubble burst would signal a new, more efficient approach to AI technology investments. "The bubble pop won't be a disaster. It will be a reset. And America's hard-working, smart people will use that reset to revolutionize the economy with AI -- the right way," Bittner said. "It will always be about the people. Not the algorithms." Julie Hanson is a freelance writer who has reported on local news across Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Title: Investors Brace for Revelations in New AI Bellwether Oracle’s Latest Report

Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to a possible AI bubble. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com When tech giant Oracle, a linchpin of the artificial intelligence boom, reports quarterly earnings today, investors expect it to live up to its name — which in antiquity referred to a medium providing insight into the unknown. The unknown being where AI, an increasingly agita-prone trade, is heading in 2026. For decades following its 1977 founding, Oracle was known for enterprise software: In a 1993 cover story, Fortune dubbed chairman Larry Ellison “software’s other billionaire” after Microsoft’s Bill Gates, featuring him in a full-cut suit with peak lapels that screamed industry titan of the late 20th century. This year, Oracle vaulted to the forefront of the new century by pivoting to data centers and cloud infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom. Its share price, up 33% in 2025, made Ellison the world’s wealthiest man for a brief stint. But a certain calculus worries some investors. In September, Oracle announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI that would see the ChatGPT-maker buy computing power over five years starting in 2027. Building out the capacity to provide that power, however, requires piling up more debt than can fit in a full-cut early ’90s power suit. After the deal was announced, Oracle raised $18 billion from a bond sale and now carries over $100 billion in debt. Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to the AI bubble. Those worries have manifested in two ways. First, as of Tuesday’s close, Oracle’s share price is down 32% from its record September high. Second, options traders piled into the company’s credit-default swaps in recent months as the price to guard against Oracle defaulting on its debt tripled (no one expects that to happen, but if AI bubble fears push the swaps up more, those traders could profit). Which sets the stage for today’s earnings, now considered a test of the market’s confidence in the AI trade. Many analysts think the worst fears are overblown: An Assist from Altman: Evercore advised investors to exercise “some patience as turning sentiment will take time,” adding that OpenAI could lend a helping hand if, as expected, it soon puts out an updated version of its chatbot that rivals or surpasses Google’s latest Gemini release. Some user-generated Sora videos will also make their way onto Disney+, and ChatGPT will become available to Disney employees. SpaceX’s potential monster IPO would come after what’s been a remarkable rebound year for public listings. Morgan Stanley cut its rating of Tesla for the first time in two years on Monday to “equal weight,” which is equivalent to a hold. A handful of high-profile defamation-by-AI-chatbot allegations against big tech firms are already stacking up. You might recall that in 2021, Zuckerberg deemed the metaverse so vital to the future he renamed the entire company after it. In memo this week, Altman promised the release of a new reasoning model next week that bests Google’s Gemini. Anduril was last valued at $30 billion in June, when its $2.5 billion fundraising round was oversubscribed eight times. The success of indie titles may help video game makers rely less on blockbusters and widen creative license, creating a 1UP for players. Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things. Getting us on an exercise bike doesn’t appear to be one of them. Gemini was trained on Google’s in-house chips, which look like a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Nvidia’s cutting-edge products. Wall Street’s smart money is starting to take out some short positions on the AI trade, albeit mostly around the industry’s fringes. Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Coreweave CEO defends AI circular deals as 'working together' | TechCrunch

In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype. Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way. “I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%. Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. CoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans. Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.

This launch rescheduling is a demonstration of Rocket Lab’s operational efficiency, responsiveness, and flexibility to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers, while continuing to launch more missions every year to support a growing manifest. ‘Bridging The Swarm’ will be Electron’s 19th launch of the year, closely followed by the ‘RAISE and Shine’ mission for JAXA. With these missions Rocket Lab well exceeds the Company’s 2024 launch tally of 16 missions. Upcoming Electron Launch Schedule Mission name: Bridging The SwarmLaunch Window Open: 1:45 pm NZDT, December 11 (00:45 UTC)Customer: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)Launch Site: Launch Complex 1, New Zealand Mission name: RAISE and ShineLaunch Window Open: no earlier than 4:00 pm NZDT, December 13 (03:00 UTC)Customer: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)Launch Site: Launch Complex 1, New Zealand About ‘Bridging The Swarm’‘Bridging The Swarm’ is a dedicated launch for the Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The mission will deploy NEONSAT-1A, an advanced Earth observation satellite equipped with a high-resolution optical camera to monitor natural disasters along the Korean Peninsula. NEONSAT-1A is a sub-satellite of KAIST’s NEONSAT satellites, which altogether will form two orbital planes of a constellation in a sun-synchronous orbit. The first of the NEONSAT satellites, NEONSAT-1, was launched and deployed by Rocket Lab during the April 2024 mission ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’, and has been successfully carrying out its Earth-monitoring objective. The new NEONSAT-1A satellite will be deployed to validate KAIST’s advanced satellite’s capability, boost operational utility, and pave the way for the single NEONSAT satellite to become a constellation – thus fulfilling the mission’s name, “Bridging the Swarm”. More NEONSAT satellites are scheduled for launch in 2026 and 2027. The NEONSAT program is a collaboration across multiple Korean academic, industry, and research institutions: SaTReC, which is leading the system architecture design and engineering; the Satrec Initiative(SI), a satellite manufacturer that has successfully developed a number of remote sensing satellites for low Earth orbit; and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which is managing the mission’s ground segments for the NEONSAT program. The NEONSAT program is funded by the Korean government’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) and is supervised by Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA), a newly established agency overseeing the development of aerospace technology and preparing for space-related hazards in the Republic of Korea. About ‘RAISE and Shine’:This mission will deploy JAXA’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft, a single satellite that will demonstrate eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. “RAISE And Shine” is the first of two dedicated launches for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. The second dedicated launch on Electron for the program is scheduled take place from Q1 2026. The missions are Rocket Lab’s first dedicated Electron launches directly contracted with JAXA, emphasizing Electron’s importance to reliable global space access for both domestic and allied international space agencies.

Title: CoreWeave CEO: Despite see-sawing stock, IPO was ‘incredibly successful’ after challenges of Liberation Day tariff timing
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/coreweave-ceo-ipo-success-despite-tariff-headwinds/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T00:05:08Z
Full Content:
CoreWeave has been rocked by dizzying stock swings—with its shares currently trading 52% below their post-IPO high—and it’s a frequent target of market commentators, but CEO Michael Intrator says the company’s move to the public markets has been “incredibly successful.” And he takes the public’s mixed reaction in stride, given the novelty of CoreWeave’s “neocloud” business, which competes with established cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. “When you introduce new models, introduce a new way of doing business, disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” Intrator said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco. But, he added, more people are beginning to understand the CoreWeave business model. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments,” Intrator said of CoreWeave’s March IPO, which occurred very close to President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. “In spite of the incredible headwinds, [we were] able to launch a successful IPO.” CoreWeave, which priced its IPO at $40 per share, has experienced frequent severe up-and-down price swings in the eight months since its public market debut. At its closing price of $90.66 on Tuesday, the stock remains well above its IPO price. As Fortune reported last month, CoreWeave’s rapid rise has been fueled by an aggressive, debt-heavy strategy to stand up data centers at unprecedented speed for AI customers. And for now, the bet is still paying off. In its third-quarter results released in November, the company said its revenue backlog nearly doubled in a single quarter—to $55.6 billion from $30 billion—reflecting long-term commitments from marquee clients including Meta and OpenAI, as well as French AI startup Poolside. Both earnings and revenue came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. But the numbers were not all celebratory. CoreWeave disclosed a further increase in the debt it has taken on to finance its expansion, and it revised its full-year revenue outlook downward—even with historic demand in the pipeline. With media headlines calling CoreWeave a “ticking time bomb,” and critics calling out insider stock sales, circular financing accusations, and an overreliance on Nvidia, Intrator was asked whether he felt CoreWeave was misunderstood. “Look, we built a company that is challenging one of the most stable businesses that exist—that cloud business, these three massive players,” he said, referring to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. I feel like it’s incumbent on CoreWeave to introduce a new business model on how the cloud is going to be built and run. And that’s what we’re doing.” He repeatedly framed CoreWeave not as a GPU reseller or traditional data-center operator but as a company purpose-built from scratch to deliver high-performance, parallelized computing for AI workloads. That focus, he said, means designing proprietary software that orchestrates GPUs, building and colocating its own infrastructure, and moving “up the stack” through acquisitions such as Weights & Biases and OpenPipe. Intrator also defended the company’s debt strategy, saying CoreWeave is effectively inventing a new financing model for AI infrastructure. He pointed to the company’s ability to repurpose power sources, rapidly deploy capacity, and finance large-scale clusters as proof it is solving problems incumbents never had to face. “When I look back at the history of the company, it took us a year with a company investor like Fidelity, before they were like, ‘Oh, I get it,’” he said. “So look, we’ve been public for eight months. I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished.”

Title: Big Bubbles Are Not Deterring Bullish Investors

Almost nothing seems to rattle individual investors lately. They’ve overcome fears about tariffs, inflation, and a potential stock market bubble, continuing to buy their favorite stocks and ETFs all year long. Despite concerns about economic policy, overvaluations in AI stocks, and rising prices, investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market right now, according to Investopedia’s recent survey. More than 60% describe themselves as either optimistic or cautiously optimistic, while less than a third say they are skeptical or hesitant. The late November selloff across the biggest stocks in the market—like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Palantir (PLTR)—did not deter investor optimism. In fact, it may have emboldened them to buy more, adding to their positions in the most widely held stocks in their investors’ portfolios. According to the Schwab Trading Activity Index, or STAX, Schwab clients took advantage of the drawdowns in those mega-cap stocks and bought the dip at one of the fastest paces in history. They did so even though the majority of respondents to our survey think that AI-related stocks are in a bubble, and nearly half feel the same way about the biggest tech stocks in the market. More than half also believe cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are frothy, despite the 25% decline in the price of Bitcoin over the past month. Investors have had plenty to be concerned about throughout 2025. Whether it was the Trump administration’s initially aggressive tariff policies, the rise of Chinese AI model DeepSeek, geopolitical instability in places like the Middle East and Ukraine, or the reliability of government data, headline risk has been the standard all year long. While this may have contributed to increased volatility in the stock market in recent months compared to the past few years, individual investors have mostly stayed the course with their investment strategies. They pulled back slightly on their investing plans during the tariff tantrums last April, but have steadily returned to their normal allocations across the stock market. Concerns about recent market events have also been dissipating, a sign that investors have grown accustomed to more uncertainty. While individual investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market and their portfolios, their trust in this administration continues to wane, and their concerns that its policies will hurt their investments continue to rise. Still, most believe in the relentless rise of the stock market, regardless of who might occupy the Oval Office, and expect annual returns of at least 5% over the next three years. That’s lower than the average annual returns of 14% for the S&P 500 over the past five years, but still optimistic. In yet another sign of investors’ optimism and risk tolerance, most would choose to invest an extra $10,000—if they had it—in individual stocks. They’ve benefitted from owning many of the biggest and fastest-rising stocks in the market for the past several years, and expect that trend to continue for the next decade. Individual investors' portfolios closely mirror the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500, or the top holdings in popular ETFs such as VOO (VOO), SPY (SPY), and QQQ (QQQ). They’ve remained loyal to these stocks, which include the Magnificent 7, as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). Many have become millionaires owning these stocks and have continued to buy them throughout this bull market, which began over three years ago. Their faith in these giant stocks is so strong that not only are they their biggest holdings today, but most would buy and hold the same group of stocks for the next decade. Old habits die hard—especially when the bull keeps running.

Cristin Dorgelo, then with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, at a conference in Albany, N.Y., on Oct. 23, 2012. Dorgelo is now the CEO of a new nonprofit called Government Renewal. Albany Times Union / Hearst Newspapers / Getty Images Stay Connected Sean Michael Newhouse A group of former federal leaders, many of whom served during the Obama and Biden administrations, is launching a new organization called Government Renewal to improve government operations and services. “[We’re] looking at not just efficiency but also effectiveness and whether the way in which the government is working is really building trust with the American people,” said Cristin Dorgelo, the CEO of the new organization who served as a senior advisor in the Office of Management and Budget between from 2021 to 2023. “That's the opportunity we have today: Both to look at those cross-cutting systems that power all of the government's work and some of those specific agencies that have a particularly high impact on people's lives like Social Security.” Nicole Wong, an outside advisor to Government Renewal and former deputy U.S. chief technology officer under Obama, said the organization will focus on government personnel, procurement and operations. While both Dorgelo and Wong also have Silicon Valley experience, Wong said the goal isn’t to make agencies operate like the private sector. Rather, she wants the federal government’s services to be as good as those from a corporation. “Amazon will deliver my groceries in half an hour to my house. Government needs to deliver at the speed and with the ease that people have come to be used to in their lives,” Wong said. “So the task of focusing on operational capacity is to make that a reality.” The Trump administration itself has prioritized improving governmental operations, promising that mass layoffs of federal employees will generate increased efficiencies. And the Department of Government Efficiency, which had been headed by tech mogul Elon Musk, was created to help modernize government technology; although, it’s better known for spearheading agency workforce cuts. Dorgelo, however, said that Government Renewal is nonpartisan and is not meant to be a foil to DOGE. She said the organization also would be open to collaborating with Republicans, so long as their focus is on strengthening government services. “This is a project that is born out of a desire to improve how the government delivers,” she said. “It is not a response to specific actions underway today, and that means we need to look at how the government has been working over the course of quite a number of years, and to be looking at ideas for what would improve that in the years to come, and to be ready to start implementing those ideas as soon as a window opens to do so.” Dorgelo added that Government Renewal’s efforts are currently underway, but that they’ll reach “full swing” in 2026. She also said that Government Renewal is operating as a nonprofit, but Dorgelo declined to answer specifically how the organization plans to secure funding, such as through individual donations or grants. Some of the organization’s other outside advisors include: Dorgelo said that Government Renewal also plans to work with other groups similarly focused on improving government operations like NYU’s Tax Law Center and the Federation of American Scientists. “When I started my career in government, there were fewer groups outside of government thinking about government capacity issues and government operations. Today, we see a growing array of groups working in this space,” she said. “Our goal is to be adding value to those efforts, fostering connections among those efforts and spotting gaps where we can spot partners who might be able to fill and address those gaps in developing actionable options.” Related articles Ex-feds join forces to reimagine government post-Trump Share your news tips with us: Sean Michael Newhouse: snewhouse@govexec.com, Signal: seanthenewsboy.45 NEXT STORY: Push to 'reform the government root and branch' detailed in Trump’s new management agenda Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.

Broadcom (AVGO) is slated to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with traders expecting the chipmaker's stock could hit fresh record highs after the report. Based on current options pricing, Broadcom stock is expected to rise or fall by up to 6% by the end of the week. Based on Monday's closing price, that would lift Broadcom's stock to around $425 on the high end, further past the intraday record of $407 the stock set on Monday, or push it down to about $377. Last quarter, Broadcom's revenue hit a record $15.95 billion as the company topped estimates, prompting some analysts to call Broadcom a "Magnificent 8" stock that could continue to grow alongside Nvidia (NVDA) if the AI industry keeps expanding. Broadcom stock rallied following the report, setting multiple record highs in the months since. Broadcom designs AI chips used by several big tech companies—including Google, Meta and OpenAI—to train and run AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Broadcom stock has been less affected than shares of other tech giants by the recent concerns over an AI bubble. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.

Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.

Title: This Dividend Aristocrat Turned $100k Into $4 Million in 25 Years

Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Vadi Fuoco / Shutterstock.com When you first think about a Dividend Aristocrat stock, it’s likely not Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ). People usually assume Dividend Aristocrats are slow-growing cash cows that will keep you ahead of inflation with dividends, and perhaps a bit more on top of that. Very rarely do you assume a Dividend Aristocrat would have the bearings to outperform even the Nasdaq-100 over the past 25 years. That’s a perfect sign that you’re underestimating the power of compounding. These dividend stocks look boring on the surface, but their snowballing dividends can make you outperform even growth stocks in the long run. Let’s take a look at what made it possible with CNQ and whether or not you can expect similar returns in the next 25 years with this stock. Canadian Natural Resources is one of the world’s largest independent crude oil and natural gas producers. It operates across the entire oil and gas value chain, from exploration to marketing. The company also owns midstream infrastructure. The magic behind its outperformance over the long run is the rising dividend and the company’s ability to capitalize whenever there’s an increase in oil and gas prices. CNQ stock is up over 180% in the past five years and still comes with a forward dividend yield of nearly 5%. It has been raising its dividends for 25 years straight and has returned over CAD 6 billion in the first nine months of 2025. What’s even more impressive is that the 5-year dividend growth rate is at 22.37% annually. The forward payout ratio is still 64%. If there’s ever trouble in the oil and gas markets, there’s ample breathing room. CNQ raised dividends through 2020 (when oil prices briefly dipped into the negatives). It also kept paying dividends through the 2014 oil price collapse. If you invested $100k in mid-2000 and kept reinvesting dividends, your overall return would be 3,925.28%. This means your original investment would top $4 million today. If you put the same amount of money into the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and reinvested the meager dividends, you’d end up with $823,680 today. The Dot Com bubble slowed down the QQQ significantly, whereas the 2014-2016 oil slowdown also caused CNQ stock to underperform for a long stretch. Regardless, long-term investors still made progress as they reinvested dividends, and the company eventually made a recovery in earnest. CNQ stock is unlikely to hand you another 40x in the next 25 years, but it is still worth owning since it comes with great yields and still has upside potential. The company’s performance in the past 25 years was due to oil prices rising significantly in the early 2000s, which coincided with the company building out massive oil sands mining and thermal operations, transitioning from higher-decline conventional assets to 57% long-life, low-decline production with only an 11% corporate decline rate. This gave it a large early head start. Average crude oil prices jumped from $19.69 in 1999 to $98.69 in 2008. So far in 2025, it is much lower at $64.39. If you adjust for inflation, crude oil prices are actually lower today than they were in late 2000. This shows the company can keep expanding and paying dividends even if the broader energy market is flat or trending downwards. The demand for oil and gas should remain strong, at least for a North American company like Canadian Natural Resources. There is an ongoing push towards re-industrialization and onshoring. Plus, the drive towards renewable energy has been nowhere near as aggressive as previously thought. Countries are relying heavily on oil and gas, even more so than before. Sanctions on certain countries after 2022 make it even more likely that CNQ stock is well-positioned to deliver. European countries have turned to North America for their energy needs. Both the U.S. and Canada are seeing an oil and gas export boom to Europe, with analysts saying Canada’s current Prime Minister’s aim is “…to author a sequel to the oil boom that Canada experienced between the start of the century and 2014. He’s never put it so plainly, but it’s clearly the target.” In short, CNQ can keep growing in the coming decades and keep outperforming most other dividend stocks.

Title: Amazon Multiplayer Game Reportedly Got 10x Fewer Players Than It Was Hoping For

Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:26:06Z
Full Content:
king of meat King of Meat developer Glowmade will layoff “around a dozen people” early next year, according to a new report from Insider Gaming. These “voluntary redundancies” come just two months after the multiplayer party game hit Steam and after it reportedly failed to hit an ambitious 100,000 concurrent player target. King of Meat peaked at just 320 people on PC instead. Over the past few days, several Glowmade developers posted to LinkedIn that they’re looking for work. The U.K.-based studio published King of Meat in October, backed by Amazon Game Studio. Insider Gaming reported that discussions around the layoffs began earlier in December, and that leadership previously told staff the studio “had the runway to keep going.” Amazon Game Studios announced in 2021 that it was expanding its publishing efforts with Glowmade, which was working on an “exciting new IP.”Â Glowmade had 25 staffers, according to a news release at the time. The studio’s leadership was reportedly hoping King of Meat would reach “a concurrent player count of at least 100,000,” but instead failed to maintain 1,000 players across platforms. On Steam, King of Meat had a recent 24-hour peak of 23 players; its top concurrent player number there is 320 players, according to SteamDB. Most people probably only remember it as the game with the flashy trailer at Gamescom 2024 which featured an animated version of Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley. That memorable moment could have cost close to half a million dollars, but apparently didn’t do much to keep King of Meat bubbling around in the popular consciousness. King of Meat‘s October release didn’t go well despite a huge marketing push, including a big-budget MrBeast video. The video, which included a whole dang set, more than a dozen content creators, and a $250,000 prize, is essentially a mini-King of Meat esports event. It was published just after King of Meat‘s release date and racked up 6.8 million views. Kotaku has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © pestoverde / Flickr Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is pushing higher on a report from Truth Social that the tech giant could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and other high-demand areas. All under the condition that a quarter of sales be paid to the U.S. government. As a result, analysts at Bernstein just initiated an outperform rating on NVDA, noting that if reports are accurate, NVDA can ship chips to some customers in China, which is a positive development. Just yesterday, analysts at Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia, citing a significant opportunity with data centers. After all, artificial intelligence will continue to create massive demand for data centers. Right now, according to MIT Technology Review, there are about 3,000 data centers across the U.S. Plus, according to a report from McKinsey, $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure investments will be needed by 2030. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are down about $2.62 at the moment. However, Deutsche Bank analysts see more upside heading into earnings. The firm reiterated its buy rating on MU ahead of the company’s earnings on December 17, with a price target of $280, up from $200. The firm believes MU is well-positioned to benefit from the memory cycle, with HBM driving structural changes in the semiconductor industry. And down, but not out, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are being viewed positively by analysts at Needham. The firm has a buy rating on NFLX and doesn’t believe it needs Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the firm, “NFLX buying WBD would put $83B of additional value at risk of being disrupted by GenAI. Without WBD, NFLX is more global, more nimble, more tech-first, and has more flexibility with the Hollywood unions (called Guilds),” as quoted by CNBC. Just the other day, Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on NFLX. The firm noted, “We acknowledge that NFLX shares have been largely reactive to recent developments re: potential strategic outcomes. But we believe Netflix’s long-term fundamental outlook is increasingly strengthening, thanks to its highly compelling value proposition, its excellent execution track record, and its improved global, competitive positioning,” as quoted by CNBC.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Choosing between two top-tier dominant forces in any particular sector can be a difficult task. In the world of crypto, investors looking to put long-term capital to work in tokens they view as long-term stores of value outside the monetary system do have a few choices to choose from. Of course, there’s the first (and still the largest) cryptocurrency out there which is most often viewed as such a monetary system hedge – Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Bitcoin’s historical performance, its sheer size at a market capitalization of more than $1.8 trillion, and its ardent investor base makes this top token one investors have to consider up front. That said, there are other base layer networks such as XRP (CRYPTO:XRP) which are quickly becoming their own unique asset classes investors want to own. Plenty of XRP investors, who have held through Ripple’s long and arduous legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), may now view this token as truly battle-tested. XRP’s network, at least in terms of transaction activity, is a dominant force in the crypto landscape. So, which top-tier digital asset is the better long-term bet right now? Let’s dive in. There’s really not much that needs to be said about Bitcoin. It’s the biggest, largely considered to be the most stable, well-known, and liquid cryptocurrency out there. For traders, speculators and long-term investors alike, Bitcoin is often the only choice when it comes to playing momentum-driven moves in this space. And notably, the early introduction of spot ETFs and other exchange traded products which offered traditional investors an avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin has propelled massive amounts of investor capital into this network. Now, given Bitcoin’s size at a market capitalization that’s nearing $2 trillion, absolute floods of capital are going to need to continuously pour into this ecosystem in order for investors today to see upside. Indeed, a 10x from here would require Bitcoin to achieve a market capitalization of roughly $18 trillion, which would make this digital asset (which doesn’t generate cash flows and can’t be seen or held) worth more than any other entire stock market index of any country outside the United States (China currently has the second-largest equity market capitalization of around $12 trillion). That’s an incredible statistic. Of course, Bitcoin’s dominant position in terms of network value, liquidity, usage and as a perceived store of value will remain. This is among the most integral pieces of infrastructure in this sector, with a n important role for corporate treasuries and the balance sheets of financial institutions. As such, there are now many vested interests in seeing Bitcoin’s price continue to rise. Over the long-term, most investors would say Bitcoin will be the more stable bet. But will it outperform XRP? XRP visual XRP is certainly a more compelling opportunity for investors looking more for outright growth right now. As far as a utility-focused network is concerned, XRP’s key XRP Ledger technology, which allows individuals, companies and large financial entities to transfer vast amounts of capital around the world at lightning fast speeds and ultra-low costs (compared to other networks such as SWIFT which can take days to close, and take percentage points off each transaction), is very valuable. In the world of cross-border finance, XRP is clearly a long-term winner. I’m bullish on this area of the crypto market myself, and I think that this is ultimately what Bitcoin’s founders intended (at least in part) when creating the Bitcoin network to begin with. To a certain extent, XRP has capitalized on this initial mission, and perhaps done a better job than Bitcoin of creating the sort of integrated rails many coming out of the GFC hoped would exist. Being able to transfer money outsize of the system, while retaining key remittance data that ensures one will reliably receive these funds same-day, can provide immense value to an immeasurable number of counterparties. 24/7 Wall St. In my view, Bitcoin’s bull case is more conducive to long-term investors who may be more concerned around capital preservation over long periods of time. Indeed, the reality for the digital assets sector is that there are a number of high-profile blowups which have effectively pulled the rug out from underneath some pretty savvy investors. There are simply plenty of investors out there who won’t want to fall prey to such a situation, and given Bitcoin’s aforementioned status as a key treasury holding on many balance sheets within the U.S. economy (and even the U.S. government), there’s a broad vested interest in seeing this token continue to appreciate over time. Despite XRP’s enhanced utility and status as a key network to “get things done,” that’s the way things stand right now in my view. As such, and being an investor who is inherently more conservative than many out there, I’m going to stick with Bitcoin as my top crypto pick for right now. Of course, every investor’s risk tolerance preferences and investing style will differ. There are plenty of investors out there would would pick XRP over Bitcoin any day of the week (and by way of each network’s sheer size, it’s mathematically easier for XRP to 10x in value from here). But for those looking to steer clear of as much unnecessary volatility as possible, while generating market-beating returns over time, Bitcoin still stands as my preferential pick (particularly during selloffs).

Title: Streaming Apocalypse: How Netflix Could Kill AMC and Movie Theaters Forever

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Paperkites / iStock via Getty Images Netflix‘s (NASDAQ:NFLX) $72 billion bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery‘s (NASDAQ:WBD) movie studios and streaming assets promises to reshape Hollywood. Valued at $27.75 per share in cash and stock, the deal targets Warner’s film production, HBO, and Max platform, with Warner Bros. cable networks like CNN spinning off into Discovery Global by mid-2026. But just yesterday, Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY) launched a hostile $108 billion all-cash takeover for all of Warner at $30 per share. This aggressive move, filed directly with shareholders, accuses the movie studio’s board of favoring Netflix and ignoring superior offers. Regulators and antitrust issues are also a concern, with critics warning of reduced streaming competition. Though it is still early, a Netflix victory could doom AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), stripping its theaters of blockbuster pipelines and accelerating streaming’s dominance. Theater attendance has plummeted, turning once-vibrant cinemas into echoes of their former selves. Data from TheNumbers.com reveals a stark trend: in 2002, U.S. audiences bought 1.57 billion tickets, the modern peak. By 2019, that fell to 1.23 billion — a 22% drop over 17 years. The pandemic crisis amplified the decline, with just 232 million tickets in 2020. Recovery has been feeble as only 761 million tickets were sold in 2024, 52% below 2002 levels and 38% under 2019. While theater attendance is running slightly higher this year compared to last year, it remains 55% below pre-pandemic highs. High ticket prices are compounding the problem. Families are getting priced out as the average ticket climbed from $5.81 in 2002 to $11.31 in 2024, more than doubling the cost. A family of four now faces $45 just to get in and not including the concession stand — AMC’s real profit center, where popcorn and drinks yield 85% margins but add $50 to $60 more to the cost of a night out. BoxOfficeMojo.com data underscores the facade: domestic box office grosses hit $11.9 billion in 2018 but dipped to $8.6 billion in 2024, a 28% decline. Attendance — unadjusted for price hikes — tells an even grimmer tale: 2024’s 761 million tickets equate to just 672 million in 2002 dollars — a 57% plunge. Many point to the promised allure of the “theater experience” — large screens, immersive sound, and witnessing an event with other moviephiles — feels hollow today. The reality is sticky floors, outdated seats, and sparse (or worse, noisy) crowds erode the magic. Chains like AMC push premium formats such as IMAX (NYSE:IMAX), but at $20 per ticket, they alienate budget-conscious viewers. Families, already squeezed by the $11 average, can readily replicate the theater experience at home. You can get an 85″ 4K TV with Dolby Atmos for under $800, delivering near-theater quality for pennies per viewing. Streaming’s convenience nails the coffin shut: you don’t have to deal with lines, upcharges, or unruly moviegoers. Attendance erosion reflects this, with a 45% decline in ticket sales between 1999 and 2024, despite the gross dollars spent masking it through price gouging. AMC Entertainment’s financials paint a precarious picture. In the third quarter, revenue reached $1.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $122 million versus $161 million in 2024. Admissions revenue per patron hit a record $12.25, bolstered by concessions at $7.74, but a $298 million net loss stemmed from refinancing $173 million in 2026 debt and equitizing $183 million more. Total debt lingers around $4.5 billion, with 2025 capital expenditures forecast at $175 million to $225 million for upgrades amid 17 net theater closures. AMC’s market share is holding steady at 26%, but a softer box office — $8.6 billion domestic in 2024 — shows its vulnerability. A Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery merger would exacerbate this. Short-term, a regular theatrical release schedule will continue, but Netflix’s streaming-first focus points to more day-and-date releases and streaming-only titles. HBO Max integration could funnel Warner hits, like DC films, straight to subscribers, eroding theater exclusivity. With 300 million Netflix users and 128 million HBO Max subscribers, viewers will choose a $15 monthly subscription over $50 to $100 family outings, hastening the theater attendance slide. AMC was already battling steep odds. Declining attendance, rising ticket prices, and concessions as its sole lifeline, all while carrying $4.5 billion in debt, is a tough sell. A Netflix win over Paramount would ignite the fuse, with fewer blockbusters, simultaneous releases to theaters and streaming, and the ease of creating an at-home theater experience, leading to AMC Entertainment’s ultimate implosion.

Title: Chasing WBD: Paramount vs. Netflix Pros and Cons | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-12-09T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Pro Available to WrapPRO members Paramount’s hostile bid puts its offer against Netflix public, but which company has the sweeter deal? The clash between Netflix and Paramount for the legendary Warner Bros. Discovery is getting downright medieval. Paramount on Monday swooped in with a tender offer to shareholders, launching a hostile bid with what it believes is a superior $30-a-share all-cash offer for the entire company. It comes just three days after WBD and Netflix said they had agreed to a cash-and-stock deal. WBD, which so far hasn’t changed its recommendation on Netflix, said it would carefully review the Paramount offer and advise its shareholders within 10 days. It marks the latest swerve in the increasingly tangled soap opera that has been the pursuit of WBD. That the bidding war has reached the hostile stage underscores the stakes surrounding the deal, with either Netflix or Paramount acquiring all or parts of Warner Bros. representing a seismic shift in Hollywood. On the surface, these competing bids represent a contest between a quick, short-term gain with Paramount vs. the longer term prospect of higher returns with Netflix. The upshot is the public will soon get a lot more detail about the deal than normal, with Paramount laying its cards on the table and WBD obligated to disclose additional information justifying its decision. Ellison and the Paramount camp were left furious with WBD for going with Netflix’s bid considering their bid offered more money, and there was some inkling things would turn this way after Paramount sent a note to WBD CEO David Zaslav last week complaining about the “tainted” bidding process that was filled with “management conflict.” The hostile bid will give shareholders more of a direct hand in deciding which way the company goes, with Netflix only seeking the studio and streaming business, leaving the cable assets to spin off as a separate business, while Paramount is looking to acquire the entire company. Here’s a breakdown of the pros, cons and different factors for each offer. Netflix is offering $23.25 a share in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock for each share of WBD, a total value of $27.75. But WBD is scheduled to spin off its cable assets, which include CNN, TNT, HGTV and several other networks, in the third quarter of 2026. WBD shareholders will also receive shares in this spin-off. Pros: Netflix, which is flush with cash and in a strong financial position, already has the board’s blessing. This scenario would also be the one in which the most jobs will be saved, since there are fewer redundant positions with Netflix not owning a studio, a point Zaslav made on Friday. Cons: Netflix faces significantly more regulatory scrutiny. While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, outside observers have said it could take two years or longer. For shareholders, that means having their money locked up longer after more than three years of lackluster stock performance. Walking away means WBD has to pay Netflix $2.8 billion in fees. X Factor: Paramount might have been feeling more confident in its hostile bid after Hollywood erupted in fear and anger over the prospect of Netflix accumulating even more power in the entertainment world. Netflix has already disrupted the industry, including killing residuals and profit-sharing deals that allow creatives to share in the financial success of their films and shows. Expect a number of trade groups and guilds to lobby lawmakers against the deal. Trump Factor: Sarandos met with Trump in late November to discuss the planned purchase of Warner Bros. and has been quietly nurturing his relationship with the president since he returned to the White House. Trump on Sunday called Sarandos “fantastic,” but noted the outsized market share and competition raised questions. TheWrap Take: On the surface, Netflix faces a massive mountain to climb from a regulatory perspective, with the company controlling the No. 1 and No. 3 streaming services — giving antitrust officials a pretty clear case to oppose it. But Netflix appears to be building its case for approval on the central issue of jobs. The company has said it plans to run Warner Bros. as-is, and noted it’s getting into new areas with its studio business, which means keeping more jobs intact. “[President Trump’s] interest in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs. Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,” Sarandos told an investor conference hosted by UBS. “We’re not cutting jobs. We’re making jobs.” Those synergies were a shot at Paramount’s projected $6 billion in merger cost savings, triple the amount Netflix had projected, signaling that the Paramount route would lead to more dramatic job cuts on top of the layoffs it’s still working through internally. Both Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters talked up Netflix’s investment in the U.S. across all 50 states, and how it’s contributed $125 billion into the U.S. economy over the last several years — clearly playing to the White House. The upshot: For shareholders, the calculus will be whether they are willing to gamble on the potential longer term gains both from Discovery Global’s spinoff and the rise in Netflix shares (the streamer’s share price dropped 3.4% on Monday). While the cable business is gradually shrinking, it still generates a ton of revenue and profits. You can look to the Comcast spinoff of Versant for a sense of how a business could be potentially valued (hint: it’s more than zero, as Ellison tried to suggest). If shareholders start to get swayed by Paramount’s bid, Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of investment bank Greif & Co., said Netflix could always sweeten its own offer. “[Netflix] can outbid deep-pocketed Larry Ellison, because at some point he decides the juice isn’t worth the squeeze,” Greif told TheWrap. “Larry’s a relative newcomer to Hollywood. Not so Netflix, which has been playing the role of entertainment industry spoiler since inception.” Pros: Paramount’s offer is much cleaner, with the company offering all cash for the entire business. Ellison’s primary sales pitch is that it can get shareholders more money and faster, with his father Larry Ellison a close ally with Trump. He expects a deal to be approved in less than a year. Cons: Paramount, already saddled with considerable debt, is taking on even more with this deal. And even with the backing of David’s father, that raises questions about its financial flexibility in the long run. The deal almost entirely discounts the value of Discovery Global, which Ellison said on CNBC could be worth close to nothing if spun out. The company is also targeting $6 billion merger cost savings, three times the amount Netflix projected, signaling heavier job cuts (Paramount is still going through cuts of its own). X Factor: When Skydance swooped in to buy Paramount, it was seen as a savior and best-case scenario for the storied media company. But the quick accumulation of power (Larry Ellison also has a controlling stake in TikTok’s U.S. business) and some of his decisions — like the appointment of Bari Weiss as head of CBS News — have rankled many in the industry who are disturbed by what they see as a Trump-aligned takeover. Ellison has taken a massive $24 billion in funding from three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds for the bid, which has also raised eyebrows over foreign ownership of critical media assets. Trump Factor: Adding Weiss and working with government funds like Saudi Arabia were both seen as moves designed to curry favor with Trump. But as evidence of how unpredictable Trump is, this morning he attacked “60 Minutes” and Paramount just after the takeover was announced. TheWrap Take: Ellison’s offer and sales pitch is simple: Get more cash sooner with us. The downside is you won’t be participating in any upside from Discovery Global since it will be part of Paramount. Hostile bids have a mixed track record of success, with few examples of attempts in the media business working out. Analysts over the weekend had pontificated on whether Ellison needed to raise his offer, considering this was already reviewed and rejected by the WBD board. Still, this is a highly unusual situation with an unpredictable Trump White House, and David’s father Larry has actually won a hostile takeover himself when Oracle acquired Peoplesoft in 2005. Paramount needs the acquisition to scale up and better compete with giants like Amazon, Apple and, yes, Netflix. The upshot: While there are a lot of people in Hollywood terrified of Netflix’s potential to disrupt the industry, there’s likely others just as uneasy with Paramount’s power and its ties to Trump and, more recently, to the three sovereign wealth funds, which TheWrap previously identified as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). And while Paramount has a smoother road to regulatory approval, the idea of it buying another studio may still raise antitrust concerns, and Trump’s opinions on the company seems to change by the day. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and CEO of Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, believes financially coercing a company never works in the entertainment industry, noting the longer term reputational damage from such a move. “It’s very easy to become seen as the Darth Vader in the media business, and then you’re no longer a magnet for top talent, and as you lose that top creative talent, you’re also going to lose viewership,” Sonnenfeld told TheWrap. For an industry already devastated by consolidation, it’s choosing between the lesser of two evils. Netflix could disrupt the industry and harm the theatrical business. Paramount could slash even more jobs and produce fewer films after consolidating studio assets. It’s no wonder Snen. Elizabeth Warren, on the heels of slamming the Netflix-WBD deal as an “anti-monopoly nightmare,” called the Paramount hostile bid “a trap to set higher prices” on Monday. For shareholders, it’s a simpler choice of opting between cashing out with Paramount in about a year or sticking it out longer to benefit from the potential upside of Discovery Global and Netflix shares. The question is, ultimately, who comes up with the highest credible offer? “They’re both credible companies,” said Charles Elson, founding director of University of Delaware’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “Obviously, Netflix has done very well and Paramount is backed by quite a wealthy individual family. But it’s ultimately, who pays and has the most money.” Lucas Manfredi contributed to this story.

Title: Bitget Reports Record 4,468% Surge in Tokenized US Stock Futures During Earnings Season

December 09, 2025 08:02 ET | Source: Bitget Limited Bitget Limited Seychelles Seychelles VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has released new data showing unprecedented growth in global demand for tokenized US equities during the recent earnings season. From mid-October to the end of November, spot trading volume for tokenized US stock tokens increased by 452% month-over-month, while futures trading volume rose by 4,468%, marking the strongest period of activity since these products launched on Bitget. The report examines the acceleration of tokenized equity adoption and identifies three underlying forces driving this growth. The first is the composition of assets themselves, with demand gravitating toward technology leaders and crypto-linked equities that offer high volatility and directional opportunity. The second is the shift toward 24-hour market accessibility, which lowers traditional barriers and allows traders to participate across global time zones without interruption. The third is the influence of a globally diverse user base, whose trading patterns and risk appetites are reshaping how tokenized markets form, scale, and mature. Futures markets experienced extraordinarily aggressive trading behavior centered around mega-cap technology stocks, with Tesla, Meta, MicroStrategy, Apple, and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) dominating activity. Meta’s futures volume increased 40,774%, Microsoft 24,339%, and MicroStrategy 11,684% MoM, reflecting traders’ efforts to capture earnings-driven volatility and AI-related momentum. Spot market participation showed a more balanced allocation pattern. Nvidia led with 1,888% MoM growth, accompanied by broad index exposure through QQQ (+3,492%) and SPY (+3,247%). The surge in demand for TLT (+69,573% MoM), the long-term Treasury ETF, demonstrated a move toward defensive hedging and macro risk management during a volatile reporting season. Bitget’s 5×24 trading model proved critical in enabling this activity. Global trading patterns revealed that Asian users, in particular, leveraged extended access to respond to earnings releases, adjust positions before the US market opens, and mitigate overnight risk, advantages unavailable through traditional equity markets. The user base remained distinctly international, led by East Asia (39.66%), alongside meaningful participation from Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Behavioral segmentation showed high-frequency “whales” executing an average of 51.7 trades per day, while retail traders engaged more selectively around earnings catalysts. “What we’re seeing is the emergence of a fully democratized global equity market,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “When investors across continents can participate in earnings season in real time, using USDT, with 24-hour access and without geographic barriers, the market becomes broader, more liquid, and fundamentally more sophisticated. Tokenized equities are no longer experimental. They are becoming a mainstream asset class shaped by global capital and global behavior.” Bitget’s findings indicate that tokenized stock tokens have entered a new phase of structural maturity, defined by diversified investment strategies, seamless global access, and increasingly sophisticated market participants.

The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. Thereâs support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like theyâre happening right in your living room. For instance, when cars race past, youâll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone canât offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, thereâs 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if youâre right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on whatâs happening in the real world with the See-through View function. As for the controllers â these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when youâre not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when youâre just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line. All in all, if youâve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like youâre a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all thatâs happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount. Amazon wonât be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, itâs best to get your orders in as soon as you can.

Greg Rosalsky A professional Santa Bennett Raglin/Getty Images North America hide caption 'Tis the season to be jolly. That is, unless you're a worker who was banking on getting a seasonal job and haven't been able to find one this season. Every year, American retailers hire extra help as the holiday shopping season approaches. In recent years, these jobs have numbered roughly around half a million per season. These seasonal jobs run the gamut. Think temporary cashiers, gift wrappers, sales associates, greeters, merchandisers, warehouse unloaders, delivery drivers. But the quintessential — and most iconic — seasonal worker has got to be… Santa Claus. In addition to sliding down chimneys to deliver presents on Christmas, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas takes gigs at places like malls, department stores, corporate events, and private parties in the weeks leading up to Dec. 25. However, this year, Santa may be making fewer trips from the North Pole than in years past. As we report in this week's Planet Money newsletter, demand for professional Santas seems to have cooled. It's one small part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this holiday season. It got us wondering how the market for Santas fluctuates with the business cycle, which sectors of the Santa market are recession-proof, and whether a decline in Santa demand this season could be a sign that the U.S. economy is going down the chimney. Mitch Allen is the founder and "Head Elf" at Hire Santa, an agency that provides Santas for holiday events around the nation and world (we talked to Allen in a past Planet Money newsletter). Allen estimates there are probably around nine or ten thousand professional or "near professional" Santa Clauses in the United States. Sure, Allen says, his company may occasionally get requests for Santa at "Christmas in July"-style events, when Santa shows up in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops. But, no surprise, prime time for his business is right now. He says demand for Santa typically begins in early November, picks up steam on weekends in December and explodes the week before Christmas, especially on Christmas Eve. "It really falls off after Christmas Eve, like midnight Christmas Eve," Allen says. Allen says he's seeing less demand for Santa visits this season. His leading indicator for Santa demand is what he calls "leads," or inquiries to his business to book Santa at events. On that metric, he says, "we're down almost 27% year to date, compared with last year. And last year was down compared with the year before." My family has experienced this decline in Santa appearances first hand. Last year, when our son was about 15 months old, we took him for his first time to sit on Santa's lap. A hotel in Lake Tahoe had a public event that served as a toy drive for Toys for Tots. There was festive music, ice skating, skiing, hot chocolate, sleigh rides, and, of course, Santa. To be honest, our son was too young to understand why we were putting him on an old, bearded man's lap, but the whole experience was fun for us parents and we got cute pictures. We wanted to go back this year, but the hotel decided not to host its community event this year. No Santa. Bah, humbug! We're living through a weird economic moment right now, with mixed signals about how good or bad the economy is doing. And we just had the longest government shutdown in American history, which not only hurt the economy, but basically created a blackout for official economic statistics. Since the end of the shutdown, the Trump administration has delayed and even canceled some economic reports, and we're now all sort of in the dark, trying to figure out what the heck the economy really looks like right now. But there are some candles illuminating what's going on — and this seeming decline of demand for Santa could be one small one suggesting that the overall economy is sleighing downward. It's part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this year, something a number of sources have reported in recent weeks. For instance, back in late September, Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, a human-resources firm, released their annual seasonal hiring report. They projected that hiring this holiday retail season would "fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009." Part of the story could be that holiday shopping is increasingly moving online, and brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling and maybe hiring less help. That's an ongoing, long-term structural change to the economy that doesn't say much about whether we're heading into recession. However, there are a number of signs that softened demand for seasonal workers is related more to a broader slowdown in the economy. Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, told us we haven't seen a miraculous turnaround in the market for seasonal workers since they issued their projection back in late September. Even more, he says, the broader labor market seems to have only gotten worse since they made their projection. In November, his company, which also tracks layoffs, reported an alarming spike in companies announcing layoffs. That includes prominent online retailers like Amazon and delivery companies like UPS. "So we have two signals, and both are not good for the labor market or seasonal hiring," Challenger says. Likewise, Indeed Hiring Lab, which leverages the job site Indeed's large amount of data to provide insights about the labor market, recently reported they're also seeing bad news in the job market this season. "What we're seeing right now in seasonal hiring is kind of a microcosm of what we're seeing in the broader labor market, which is that things are cooling down, things are slowing down," says Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official body that calls recessions, defines a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months" (listen to our Planet Money episode, "Recession Referees," for more about this). The lack of official economic statistics for the last few months makes it hard to say whether we're on our way to a recession — or whether we're already in one. But, while reporting this story, we've found ourselves wondering: could declining demand for Santa visits during the holidays potentially be a recession indicator? Like, can it be a sign we're in a ho-ho-horrible economy? Do paid Santa appearances boom in good economic times and go bust during recessions? Or is demand for Santa fairly recession-proof? Hire Santa didn't officially launch until 2012 — after the Great Recession — and Head Elf Allen couldn't tell us much about the hard data on how Santa demand fluctuates over the business cycle. Moreover, his business doesn't capture the full market for Santa, including DIY Santas where people buy or rent Santa costumes and do events themselves. But Allen did offer us a theory of how he thinks demand for professional Santas is affected by recessions. For one, he says, there will always be parts of the economy where demand for Santa is fairly recession-proof. He says that many businesses use Santa appearances to "help drive traffic and associate their brand with Christmas." In this way, a store or mall paying for Santa to sit in a chair and converse with children could be seen as a kind of loss leader, a product or service that costs a company money as a way to attract more customers, nudge them to shop, and help their business make more money. Think like free or cheap alcohol at a casino. Allen says that, even in recessions, certain types of businesses and organizations will always want to hire Santa. "But I don't think that translates to a company party or a home visit," Allen says. "That's not something that you have to have. You can go to the mall and see Santa. You can go to outdoor stores and see Santa. You can see Santa if you want to. You don't have to have 'em come to your home or office." Indeed, that's a pattern that Allen believes he's seeing with a cursory look at his company's data. He believes the primary driver of the decline of demand for paid Santa visits is from private holiday parties and events. "Consumers are not reaching out to have Santa or Mrs. Claus or other holiday entertainers come to their home or office for a Christmas party," Allen says. "And so I view that as like people scaling back their own Christmas plans. They may still be having parties but they're not having sort of blowout parties with Santa and other holiday characters there." Allen pointed to recent reports that companies are laying off workers and that consumer credit card debt is at an all time high. It makes sense why people might be scaling back. So, yeah, maybe a big decline in Santa appearances could be a recession indicator. The good news, Allen says, is that, while overall demand is down, he's still seeing plenty of requests for Santa. In other words, don't worry, Santa is coming to town. There just might be fewer places or times to see him this year. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The U.S. Is Betting the Economy on ‘Scaling’ AI: Where Is the Intelligence When One Needs It?

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14. Crucially, most of the mega-financing deals are remarkably circular. To give you a flavour: Nvidia invests in OpenAI and OpenAI is looking to buy millions of Nvidia’s specialized chips. OpenAI buys computing power from Oracle which buys Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia owns about 5% of CoreWeave and sells chips to CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, shares revenue with OpenAI, buys chips from Nvidia and has partnerships with AMD. AMD, a rival to Nvidia, was so eager to land OpenAI as a customer that it issued warrants for OpenAI to buy 10% of AMD at a penny a share. OpenAI is a CoreWeave customer and also a shareholder. Nvidia has invested in xAI and will supply it with processors. And so on and so forth. The deals include revenue sharing across the stack and cross-ownership. Nothing in these circular deals is transparent. It is not clear where the money needed for these deals is coming from. It is not clear what these opaque circular transactions imply for the valuations of the listed and non-public AI firms involved. It is not clear what all this means for the competition over hardware between chip producers (Nvidia versus AMD) and over AI services AI startups (OpenAI versus Anthropic versus xAI versus Microsoft). Not surprisingly, therefore, these astronomical circular financing deals (referencing billions of U.S. dollars) are raising eyebrows. To many observers, they bring back traumatic memories of the circular financing arrangements of the late 1990s, when vendors and clients reinforced each other’s dotcom stock valuations without generating any real value. AI Bang or Bubble? AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE, but real and sustainable. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated (in an earnings call on November 19) that there is no AI bubble and exponentially growing AI demand is structural rather than speculative. Huang claims that the AI boom constitutes a Big Bang, a historical revolution, because of three fundamental shifts toward accelerated computing: the move from CPUs to GPUs (which can simultaneously process multiple tasks and solutions), the rise of generative AI, and the emergence of agentic AI systems that supposedly can independently make decisions based on large datasets. Asset-managing firm Blackrock concurs: “AI is not just a technological trend; it represents an infrastructure transformation with growing macroeconomic significance”, adding that “unlike the speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and early 2000s, today’s technology leaders are anchored by fundamental stability.” The optimistic vibes around the transformative power of AI have even infected Nouriel Roubini (2025), the profession’s perennial Dr. Doom and now a senior economic strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, who has somehow become convinced that the tailwinds of the unprecedented AI data-centre investment boom will overwhelm any disruptions coming from Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical strains. But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like. For the AI, it is all hallucination. Hallucination is an extreme case of misperception. First one has to admit that our senses are far from perfect so we human can naturally hallucinate. For instance when we see mirages in the desert. Couple our limitations with drugs and the hallucinations can become a permanent feature. Illusory thinking and illusory perceptions might be defined as a kind of hallucination which derives from strong stimuli. Because the LLMs are forced to have an answer (are stimulated to reply) always or nearly always the term “illusory thinking” might be more appropriate than hallucination. For the AI it is all an illusion. Just an illusion for the elder or a beautiful Illusion for the younger. You can Hallucinate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBmIfaHLKQ&list=RDGgBmIfaHLKQ&start_radio=1) with this Dua Lipa. I think hallucination is a sort of marketing term that implies that the results that we consider bad are anomalous, like a made up reference is worse than a real one for us. For the LLM they are the same. Humans are prone to apophenia, or seeing patterns in random information that aren’t there, it seems generative AI applies the patterns whether they are there or not. People are also prone to generate plausible answers with no information, and present them as if they were true. This behavior, epitomized in the BS artist, has also been adopted by chatbots. “Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public.” What tells another part of the story: Look at what the the Nasdaq and S&P indexes were doing in 2022. Some hype needed to be created and fast. Outstanding article. Does a good job of summarizing the major problems of the AI craze in an accessible way (Ed Zitron gets a shout-out, which I find personally satisfying since it shows that a bizzare writing style does not lock you out of the discourse!) One thing I don’t understand is why the fourth section of critiques, which is basically that AI doesn’t work and is unfit for purpose, is left for last. This seems to be a common feature of AI criticism, the fact that AI is technically unsound and inherently dangerous, is downplayed and treated as a minor issue compared to things like economic problems in the industry. The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Talk about burying the lede! BTW, there is an extremely good metaphor for LLMs in here: More generally, we have to think of LLMs … as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. It’s an urgent task to find ways to explain the problems with AI in ways that people outside the industry can effectively grasp. “AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE…” When “industry leaders” feel the need to make such a statement it’s a sure sign that it is. Not sure which deals, but in the case of Meta raising funding for AI data centres, Zuckerberg has personally promised to reimburse the investors in the event that things go sideways. If he had not done so, no one was going to invest so much as a nickel. A promise you can take to the bank, I’m sure. Ha Ha. No Making Shit Up. Zuckerberg has not made any personal guarantees. They were made by Meta entities, FFS. I take umbrage at those who misinform readers. One more like this and you will be blacklisted. Anyone with a simple four function calculator, not AI-bot, can figure out that the economics of this whole proposition simply cannot work. No one can explain where the massive amount of revenue will come from to service all this investment. It’s really not that complex. Oh, I think israel is perfectly willing to pony up billions of (taxpayer) USD to keep the AI surveillance and murder going. After all, they are the field testers for the US model. “Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control.” I can’t imagine OpenAI is a potential $500 billion IPO, it had revenues of $5 Billion first half and no one knows how much it paid Amazon and/or Google for “compute”! The other day Ed Zitron wrote about a leaked memo [allegedly in] NVIDIA explaining NVIDIA is not ENRON. https://www.wheresyoured.at/nvidia-isnt-enron-so-what-is-it/ A long read; but if you know anyone effected by the dotcom/telecom bust it brings memories.! Looking into AI. It is capitalizing on Moore Law for speed, aka smaller transistors! We can now do a google/wiki in AI using 10 times the energy of a basic article on “old” formats. We can now compute (huger simulations?) things that Markov, Von Neuman and Feynman were creating math to estimate or simulate! Brings me back to my undergrad BS studies in the late 1960’s when you could see the transistors in a computer the size of a room. Some things I learned: Amazon is building data centers with its TPU chips, Google has a chip of its own. NVIDIA already has competition in at least two big scalers! There are two kinds of AI: generative and agentic. Generative writes stories and is “google” running on supercomputing. Agentic is AI running self driving cars and drones attacking targets based on stored images, etc. Agentic is where you may train an LLM to replace a stockroom clerk, Once I did some searches I got on some internet mailers. Last night I received an invite to a free course to see how I can evolve my business to use XX_AI! The marketing is showing some fear. Data centers, require huge energy, huge banks of “racks” containing trays of tiny 2 nanometer chips (?) all connect by copper comms. The current cannot have voltage bumps implies all electricity going through uninterruptable power supplies using huge battery banks. The sustainment of data centers is likely costly. With several competitors and small transistor arriving the product life of chips is short, likely much shorter than the payback of the debt…… AI is making use of computing evolved to simulate nuclear chain reactions, that kept scientists in Manhattan project up at night! It is possibly useful to run complex simulations in basic science research…… Elsewhere it is sledgehammer tapping carpet tacks. The term is overused. We have tools at work, tools we’ve used for years that are no more complex than an online shopping cart or search engines limited to a data set. These are now called AI, I guess to make the other AI garbage look like it’s in good company. Do calculation X a zillion time doesn’t generate anything. Just saves time. Perhaps some of the folks who rely on these uses imagine LLMs will catch up and be equally useful. The “word extruder” metaphor might work. They just give you word slime, like meat extruder give you pink slime. That’s not what “agentic” AI is. LLMs are a type of generative AI that generate text based on the input/context. Image/video/audio generation is also a type of generative AI. If you allow and train the LLM to call tools/use commands to perform certain tasks (if more info is needed, use the search tool for example) and accomplish given goals, you get an agent. Self driving/drones/etc. use a completely different types of machine learning that are not related to LLMs. The thing I wish more people found troubling was the circular financing. It would seem to imply that when things go sideways, that it will become a contagion to all the linked entities. When it implodes, it will likely happen very quickly. Perhaps congress can pass a bill to preemptively deny any taxpayer money to bail out failing firms connected with AI? Would I pass out if I hold my breath? It was very interesting to note that not only the chips, but the data centers themselves may have a depreciation cycle of just a couple of years! Digital lettuce. “Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. Leaving aside the underlying issue that nothing the boosters have shown us suggests that GenAI is even possible, I recall that in the early days of the AI boom one proposed solution to the problem of their power consumption was a return to analog chips. Since the GPUs are being tailored to such a degree, a purpose-built analog architecture could use just a fraction of the energy for those calculations, but we don’t see real investment in that space and I have to conclude it’s because of the increasingly rapid rate of obsolescence. They really believe we’re always 3-6 months from the singularity or whatever. So it goes for clankers.. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk … AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. ..so it goes for humans. To the extent you humans are effective world-modellers, it has been so only because you have senses and have learned to appreciate the manner in which your senses and integrations attenuate the signal, in order to focus around what the signal might originally have been. And humans are good at this, if they care to be, if the environment is not too adversarial. But when a significant weight of humanity takes information not from the world but from a deranged and inscrutable intermediary, variously adrift or malicious, or both.. Pockets of humanity already seem few. Long live nakedcapitalism. It seems to me that one can posit three separate ideas in this area which are plausible and arguably mutually compatible: 1. That in the short-term there is a bubble which is going to burst with adverse effects. LLM technology (which is not the sum of all AI) has clear limits which will prevent it delivering AGI. 2. Whatever happens, Governments, if only for military purposes, will provide financial support to enable continuing research into AI and AGI. 3. In the medium to long-term, we could see major progress made with AI and AGI which would obviously have to address the problems which the OP cites. Raspberryjam, IIRC, had some interesting insights a little while back which challenged the Silicon Valley Consensus that AGI was only six years away. I recently watched a talk with Demis Hassabis in which he suggested a little more conservatively that a timeframe of five to ten years was possible. I tend to take forecasts of the speed of technological developments with a pinch or two of salt, but I note that Geoffrey Hinton, whose talks/interviews I find quite illuminating, tends towards a twenty year horizon (though I have heard him say AGI could arrive in ten years or, alternatively, fifty years time.) In any event I think we should accept that there will be continuing progress in this area in the years to come. It is scary to think that at some point the machines may become better than humans at everything but surely we should recognise that they are now better than us at chess and at Go, that Alphafold is extraordinary in what it can do and that self-driving cars are arriving? Why, in the long run, should the machines not overtake us at all mental tasks? My aunt used to enjoy relating to me the story of her science teacher in the 1930s who told her class ‘it will never be possible to split the atom’. Generative AI in the US will have one customer. The Government. To use for military and psyop in cahoots with Meta, Google and Amazon. It won’t benefit the citizens at all but they will end up paying for it in taxation and energy/water bills. Meanwhile non-generative AI , the stuff used by most Silicon Valley start ups etc, use Chinese open source, free AI to build their focused developments that can produce real rewards and uses that benefit industry, commerce and citizens. I used to work on power and cost prediction software for data centres. interesting physics and maths. they are predictable systems , if they weren’t humans would f%ck them up the whole time… my favourite short description for people is “think of a very very big shed, full of resistors (ovens), that mainly generate heat and a useful bit of information processing on the side. but mainly heat” Ignoring whether this is a bubble, how useful any of this ies etc etc. – I don’t see how the capacity above actually gets delivered? I looked briefly at transformer supply. You’ve got grid changes, renewable energy sources and data centre boom all putting pressure on supply. one source suggesting now a 2-4 year lead time. The Transformer Crisis: An Industry on the Brink That is an article from last year but I cant see how the picture has got better? on the engineering side: A large campus could be specified at 100MW or more. 100MVA transformers are specialist bits of kit. its not like you can go to a local electrician for help in procurement, design and supply. installing and certifying these types of high voltage equipment needs serious levels of understanding and training. Errors around this level voltage are “high consequence” i.e. deadly, like “scraping up the pieces” deadly. Doesn’t sound like a capability that is easy to flex up that quickly does it? And the capacity numbers are huge. 120GW of capacity? that’s multiple countries worth – like 5 Belgiums or 10 Ukraine grids worth of power. I don’t see systemically how that is deliverable? I have a limited, observer experience of this for a few years. Is there anyone else with a stronger background on this type of engineering? No one defines AGI. This makes all intimations of reaching AGI prima facia stupid. Sam Altman say OpenAI’s Board will let us know when they’ve seen AGI. It’s not hard for me to state why AGI is fanciful. I ask myself what I would do if I had the power of AGI in my head. I think I’d do the same things I do now. Eat, sleep, read, dance, romance, and think about problems. Which problems? I could address all problems so I would probably wind up focusing on the paradox of choice. Being a paradox I’d wind up in the corner blubbering. If I stopped to think, I’d know that real human problems require human and/or political solutions. Showing off my AGI talents finds me isolated at social events. My AGI does not have a sense of humor. No one defines AGI because it’s a marketing term, introduced after AI got overused into meaninglessness. Next step will probably be MegaAGI – MAGI, and then MAGGI (for a proper alphabet soup). Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: Pick Your Financial Crash

Full Content:
The stock market has made gains at rates that are several multiples more than the growth of the real economy for three years running. Investor euphoria is always a sign of danger ahead, but this time there are other special factors signaling a pending crash. And of course, they all interact. Once investors head for the exits, others start bailing. I. Deregulation of Increasing Risk. Trump’s bank regulators are systematically dismantling the safeguards that were put in place after the financial collapse of 2008. That crash was caused by opaque financial instruments such as credit derivatives that allowed almost infinite amounts of leverage. When they turned out to be worthless, the collapse was also nearly infinite. In the aftermath, Congress and the regulators limited the risks that banks could take. In classic Wall Street form, the wise guys responded by creating non-banks that could do most of what banks do. One “innovation” was private credit, a cool-kid word for shadow banking. Another was fintech, a cool-kid word for shadow banking with an app. These newly invented lenders are banks in everything but name, and thus evade nearly all transparency, supervision, or regulation. Absent regulation, these non-bank banks can engage in sky-high leverage, meaning that the ratio of lending to their own real capital can be unlimited and unexamined. More from Robert Kuttner In 2013, as part of the post-2008 reforms, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve put in place leverage limits for banks. Loans worth more than six times a company’s annual earnings were seen as too risky. That ruled out a lot of bank loans to fund private equity takeover targets, or loans to tech fantasies that had no earnings. Private credit stepped in to fund those projects that banks couldn’t take. Capital raised for lending to private equity–backed companies jumped more than a hundredfold to nearly $700 billion between 2006 and 2024, according to The Wall Street Journal. One thing that isn’t well understood is that private credit is propped up by traditional banks; Moody’s reported in October that banks have lent $300 billion to private credit firms. So if those firms go kablooey, it won’t stop short of the broader financial system, but cascade through the heart of Wall Street. Nevertheless, the banks complained to the regulators that they were losing business (to the very companies they were funding). Given what we know about the crashes of 2008 and 1929, the right policy would be to bring the upstarts under the regulatory umbrella. But instead, last Friday the agencies agreed to the bankers’ demands to help competition by deregulating the banks and getting rid of the 2013 leverage limits. Now, dealmakers can play banks off against private credit entities for the best (most risky) terms. And banks can go beyond funding non-banks and set up their own non-bank affiliates. When the inevitable crash comes, government will bail out the insiders, leaving regular people to suffer the aftermath. II. Crypto. The value of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride. Crypto plays no useful function in the economy except for pursuing illegal transactions and speculation in crypto itself. When crypto was the next new thing, and investors keep bidding up the market value of crypto coins, everyone looked like a financial genius. The whole market has been banking on self-enrichment by the Trump family and his key allies—like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who handed his crypto-friendly bank Cantor Fitzgerald to his son and has seen it enjoy its best year ever—leading to regulatory leniency and therefore freedom to make a fortune. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Congress, on the take from the crypto industry, added to the hype last July by enacting the GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The act, written by the industry, pretends to provide prudent regulation, giving crypto a kind of federal blessing, but with no real protection for investors. But as the old Wall Street saying goes, genius is a rising market. And here again, leverage that works brilliantly on the upside becomes catastrophic when prices start falling. In recent weeks, Bitcoin, the marquee crypto product, has fallen from a peak value of just below $126,000 on October 7 to about $90,000 today. In just one week in November, the asset class lost $400 billion in value. This collapse has multiple knock-on effects on residual crypto plays. As Bloomberg recently reported, “An array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up Bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.” But once prices started falling, “The median stock price of US and Canadian-listed digital asset treasuries has fallen 43% this year, with some companies’ stocks falling over 99%.” When the crypto craze began, traditional financial companies were insulated from it. But Wall Street has tried to get in on the action by sponsoring crypto-backed funds, exposing blue-chip firms like BlackRock to risk. I recently got a pitch from a crypto company promoting the story of how an entrepreneur in Argentina shielded himself from exchange rate risk and inflation risk by loading up on Bitcoin. In fact, the entrepreneur could have gotten exactly the same benefits by buying dollars. Buying Bitcoins rather than dollars added the risk that the Bitcoins would lose value—which they have. What’s really happening, as it does in every Ponzi scheme, is that the wise guys, who profited handsomely by getting in early, need more rubes to keep buying the stuff in the hope that it will hold its value. As crypto becomes more interconnected with the rest of an unregulated financial system, the risk is that they will take each other down. III. Artificial Intelligence and Tech. Is the AI boom a bubble? Apologists for the massively inflated value of Nvidia and other digital stocks reliant on the growth of AI keep pointing out that unlike pure stock market bubbles, where inflated stock prices are based mainly on the hope of further price rises, AI is adding real value and Nvidia is earning real and massive profits. Maybe. On the other hand, a dangerously concentrated share of the stock market’s run-up, more than half, is in just seven companies, the so-called Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Of these, Tesla is already faltering. Another tech giant, OpenAI, had a disappointing rollout of the latest version of its marquee product, ChatGPT. The massive bet on AI may pay off in many respects. But any economy that is this highly concentrated is at risk. With inflation rising and the cost of capital increasing with it, the $3 trillion widely projected to be invested in AI in the coming years becomes more costly and risky. Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype. The Red Sox could also win next year’s World Series. If folks in the business of writing, editing, and curating quality reporting and analysis can only make the math work by putting their work behind a paywall, we’re in trouble. Journalism is so critical to democracy that a free press is literally safeguarded in the Constitution. But it doesn’t say, “a free press only for those who can afford it.” Information is becoming available more as a luxury good than the basis of a free society. We will never put the Prospect behind a paywall because we think information should be free.

Bengaluru, India, 9th December 2025 - According to Zerodha Fund House, digital only passive fund house in the country, in its recent study cited that total Gold ETF AUM in India has crossed ₹1L crore as of Oct 2025. This surge, matched by a spike in new investor accounts, shows that the ETF route is becoming the preferred choice for Indian gold investors since Gold also plays a key role as a strategic long-term investment and as a foundational allocation in a well-diversified portfolio. The 2025 data tells a decisive story - driven by record inflows and a price rally. “To confirm, there has been no discussion, decision, or proposal before the Board or the Audit Committee regarding any change in the statutory auditors,” it said.

The resignation has been accepted, and his last working day with the Company will be December 31, 2025. Gold and silver prices are stable, supported by risk aversion and anticipation of a 25bp rate drop by the Federal Reserve at its meeting on December 9-10. With the Fed generally expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, traders will be watching the latest economic predictions (the Dot plot) and comments from Chair Jerome Powell for signals on the central bank’s plans for 2026 and beyond. Current market pricing indicates a 90% chance of such a move, with expectations now pointing to two additional cuts next year, down from three only a week ago. The market may be anticipating that the Fed may signal that, after this rate cut, there may be a halt in the first quarter of 2026 for a few months. Technical Triggers\u0009 Gold has started its upward journey again; the next target is $4300 (~Rs 132,000) and $4345 (~Rs 133,500) with strong support at $4200 (~Rs 129,000). Silver can continue its rally towards $60 (~Rs 185,500) and $62 (~Rs 191,000), with firm support at $57 (~Rs 177,000), if tight supply conditions continue. “Bitcoin slid slightly and is holding near the $90,000 zone, but the market tone remains cautious as liquidity has thinned and participation has noticeably faded into year-end. Multiple desks highlight the same issue: spot demand is soft, ETF flows are still negative, and futures activity has reset to much lower levels. With more than seven million BTC now sitting at an unrealized loss and hedging costs elevated, the market is signalling reluctance to chase upside until visibility improves. Even short-lived rallies toward $92,000 are meeting resistance as pro traders remain defensive and continue paying up for downside protection. For now, BTC looks pinned in a narrow range, with the buy-side backdrop too light to sustain a clean breakout. Macro remains the dominant driver, and traders are approaching the Fed meeting with a fully priced-in 25 bps cut. The divergence in global policy signals (the BOJ’s tightening stance, a divided BOE, and a steady ECB) has added another layer of complexity. Soft U.S. labour data, weak housing indicators, and anxiety around AI-linked equity valuations are encouraging a more risk-averse tone across assets. Rising long-bond yields and China’s stablecoin discount point to broader caution rather than overt stress. Against this backdrop, the clearest market consensus is that direction will hinge more on Fed chair Powell’s messaging than the rate move itself. This is especially so with traders expecting a shallow easing path rather than a full cycle. Altcoins continue to trade unevenly but are showing pockets of relative strength as Bitcoin consolidates. Ethereum has held up better and is aided by improving flows and structural catalysts. It is trading near its strongest level versus BTC in over a month. XRP and Cardano are benefiting from rotational flows, while others remain pressured by weak liquidity and lingering regulatory noise. Zcash continued its climb as the token surged by 16%. If Bitcoin remains range-bound after the Fed, the environment may favour continued selective outperformance in altcoins rather than a broad rally. Still, without a pickup in market participation or clearer macro signals, sustained momentum across the altcoin complex is likely to remain sporadic and catalyst-driven. Our advice: For customers, the practical stance is to build positions gradually only near strong support. Keep leverage light and wait for a clear break above $92,000-$94,000 before expecting sustained upside.” IndiGo flights cancellation, IndiGo stocks & share price today live updates: IndiGo has signaled a recovery from its recent crisis on Monday, announcing it will operate more than 1,800 flights across its network even as government officials intensify on-ground inspections at major airports.

Both agencies reaffirmed Vedanta Resources’ credit ratings while noting the Company’s favourable earnings outlook, improved cost structure, deeper vertical integration, and the ramp-up of new capacities, particularly in aluminium, which continue to drive earnings momentum. Considering the current price action, there is a good chance for aluminium futures to see a drop in price.

Risk-on assets pause until: USD/JPY stabilises US-Japan yield differential bottoms out ▪️Europe/Emerging Markets EMs with high USD exposure (Korea, Taiwan, India) see near-term outflows. 🟦 5️⃣ FX Implications — USD/JPY Path If unwinding accelerates: USD/JPY could rapidly fall from 155 → 150 → 145 in risk-off waves. Historically, this is when global equities take a pause. If BOJ intervenes verbally or via YCC tools: USD/JPY stabilises around 152–154 Markets calm, equities rebound 🟦 6️⃣ BOJ Scenarios to Watch Scenario A — BOJ stays silent (most volatile) Scenario B — BOJ breaks yield drift (verbal intervention) Scenario C — BOJ actual bond-buying / YCC tweak 🟦 7️⃣ What this means for you For India investors like you: Stay updated with the latest news and insightful analysis by subscribing to The Hindu Business Line Newsletter.

Title: Edmonton police now testing AI-powered body cameras

Time Published: 2025-12-08T23:06:19Z
Full Content:
Edmonton Police Service (EPS) has kicked off a pilot project of AI-powered body cameras. From last Wednesday through the end of December, officers will wear the equipment from Arizona-based Axon Enterprise. The cameras will leverage facial recognition software to search for matches in a pre-loaded database. EPS says this database contains the facial data of about 7,000 people who have been flagged as a safety risk due to outstanding warrants for violent crimes, including robbery, aggravated assault and murder. How it works is the bodycam will scan faces of people within four metres of the officer and send this data to the cloud to compare against the EPC database. If the individual in question isn’t a person of interest, the data will be discard. Potential matches, meanwhile, will be sent for review by a trained professional within 24 hours. EPS believes this technology will make policing safer and faster. It also says similar facial recognition technology is already being used to identify faces in security footage. It should also be noted that the Government of Alberta mandated in 2023 that all officers in the province wear body cams. However, these AI-powered bodycams are already drawing scrutiny. For one, some have pointed out that this technology can have biases related to race, gender and age. Diane McLeod, the information and privacy commissioner of Alberta, also told CTV News Edmonton that she’s concerned about both these biases and the EPS maintaining the privacy of Canadians as outlined in the Protection of Privacy Act. It remains to be seen what may come out of this pilot once it wraps at the end of the month. EPS says it will review the results in the new year before deciding how to move forward.

December 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the Neutron launch vehicle’s innovative “Hungry Hippo” captive fairing has successfully completed qualification testing and is enroute to Virginia for Neutron’s first launch. Dubbed the Hungry Hippo, Neutron’s fairing halves remain attached to the rocket’s first stage throughout launch and landing back to Earth – a world-first for a reusable commercial rocket. Whereas typical rockets’ fairing halves fall away during launch and are disposable or require collection at sea for reuse, Neutron’s fairing halves open to release the rocket’s second stage and mission payload before closing again to return Neutron to Earth as a single reusable vehicle – enabling rapid and cost-effective reuse and streamlining operations for a high-cadence launch service for commercial, civil, and national security missions. The qualification is a key moment in the development of the reusable Neutron rocket, the world’s largest carbon composite launch vehicle with a lift capacity of up to 13,000kg (33,000 pounds). With the design, structure, and operations of Neutron’s innovative fairing now qualified for flight, Hungry Hippo is enroute to Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia ahead of Neutron’s first launch. Development of Neutron began in late 2021 and with the first launch scheduled for liftoff in 2026, it remains on track to be one of the fastest commercially developed rockets in history. Rocket Lab Vice President – Neutron, Shaun D’Mello, says: “A rocket like Neutron has never been built before, and we’re doing it at a pace and price point that’s going to bring the innovation and competition needed in today’s industry. Building, qualifying, and shipping Hungry Hippo is a fantastic marker of progress toward Neutron’s first launch, and I’m proud of the team for their attention to detail and pulling off this significant milestone.” Hungry Hippo Qualification ProgramTo qualify the Hungry Hippo fairing for Neutron’s first launch, Rocket Lab completed an intensive qualification and acceptance testing campaign that validated the structure’s expected performance during the intense aerodynamic pressure of launch and re-entry featuring full-scale tests as well as a series of sub-component tests. Tests have included (but are not limited to): Once Hungry Hippo arrives in Virginia, the fairing structure will be integrated to Neutron’s first stage in final flight configuration to undergo pre-launch testing, including static fires and a Wet Dress Rehearsal, at Launch Complex 3 ahead of first launch.

December 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives. “With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year. “We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters. “As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels. Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis. Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year. Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024. Conference Call Management will host an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, December 8, 2025 to discuss the Company’s third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with Q&A from telephone participants.

The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, contingencies, and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control.

"She missed you" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been more than seven years since Shadow of the Tomb Raider put a bow on Lara Croft's big reboot trilogy, and since then, series fans have been desperate for even a morsel of information on what's coming next. Now, finally, it seems relief is in sight, as a big Tomb Raider reveal has been teased for The Game Awards later this week. "Did you miss her?" the official Tomb Raider account asks on Twitter. "She missed you." The message encourages you to tune into the annual TGA showcase on December 11 "for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises." The news was initially revealed in Fortnite, as part of a TGA-branded island built for players to vote on their favorite fanmade creations in the battle royale hub. The teaser includes an image showing a silhouette of Lara Croft posing proudly with the old-school dual pistols that helped define her appearance in the original 1996 game. If you squint just hard enough, you can just about make out pouches and holster straps around her legs that hint at the old costume, too. Did you miss her? She missed you. 🔫As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider#TombRaider #Fortnite #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/IiN3jPQSkSDecember 8, 2025 It's possible that this reveal is tied to some non-gaming multimedia project, like maybe the upcoming Prime Video series, but I'm inclined to believe it's going to be our first look at the new Tomb Raider game Crystal Dynamics first announced way back in 2022. You don't tease "future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises" without knowing that fans are going to expect a video game reveal. The most telling bit is the new-look Lara. As far back as 2021, Crystal Dynamics was talking about its intent to "unify" the old-school Tomb Raider timeline with the modern Survivor trilogy, and we've occasionally seen new versions of the character blending '90s camp costuming with a more realistic appearance for the character herself. The idea of a "unified" Lara Croft design has grown powerful in the minds of fans, and this new teaser certainly seems to suggest something along those lines. For now, we have only two concrete bits of information on the new Tomb Raider game: it's being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and it's going to be published by Amazon Games. For a couple of years now, it's seemed that Crystal Dynamics only emerges from its silence to announce another round of layoffs before going quiet once again. Here's hoping this reveal at The Game Awards turns out to be a little more unequivocally positive. These are the best Tomb Raider games ever made.

Title: Worker-bee AGI: Why AWS is betting on practical agents, not ‘messiah AGI’

UPDATED 12:04 EST / DECEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert At AWS re:Invent 2025, Amazon Web Services Inc. faced a dual mandate: Speak to millions of longstanding cloud customers while countering a persistent narrative that the company is lagging in artificial intelligence. In our view, AWS chose a distinctly pragmatic path. Rather than chasing the holy grail of what we call “messiah AGI,” or artificial general intelligence or even competing head-on with frontier-scale large language model, the company emphasized foundational agentic scaffolding and customizable large and small language models. This approach aligns with our thesis that the real near-term value in AI lies inside the enterprise – what we see as “worker-bee AGI” – not in aspirational, generalized intelligence. Skeptics argue that this worker-bee AGI is little more than RPA 2.0, burdened by familiar data silos. Though that critique rings somewhat true, we not view AWS’ strategy as merely paving the robotic process automation cow path. Rather, we see the company making a deliberate shift from siloed agentic automation toward what we call “service-as-software” – a new model in which business outcomes, not individual applications, become the primary point of control. In this special edition of Breaking Analysis, we break down AWS re:Invent 2025 through the lens of this emerging paradigm. We’ll examine how AWS is repositioning its infrastructure, services and AI roadmap to support a transformation in the operational, business and technology models of virtually every organization and industry. At re:Invent 2025, one theme kept surfacing in our conversations in that we’re watching two fundamentally different AI models collide. On one side, we see what we call the messiah AGI quest – led by Open AI Labs PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and the frontier labs – pushing ever deeper into the earth in search of more intelligence. On the other side sits the enterprise, represented metaphorically by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and powered by renewable, sustainable data assets that grow stronger with every additional agent deployed. OpenAI and ChatGPT defined the opening chapter of generative AI by tapping a reservoir of free, high-quality internet data. Through GPT-4 and likely GPT-5, the marginal cost of data was essentially zero. Compute was expensive, but the fuel for the models was essentially free. That era is ending, in our view. As freely available high-quality data is depleted, the labs are turning to human expertise – curated reasoning traces from domain specialists – to maintain their performance advantage. We see this as a dramatically different business model. Credible reporting suggests that by 2029 to 2030, OpenAI could be spending 20% to 25% of its revenue just to acquire proprietary expert data. In our view, this is a classic diminishing-returns scenario where you achieve rising marginal costs for increasingly niche improvements. It’s the image of Altman digging deeper into the ground for shrinking seams of coal. Enterprises, by contrast, operate on renewable energy, as shown on the right hand side of the title slide. Their proprietary data grows as they deploy more agents, build more models and instrument more workflows. Every incremental deployment generates more signals, more context, more labeled outcomes. They’re on an experience curve – one that accelerates as data harmonization improves. JPMorgan Chase is the most obvious example, but it represents a much broader pattern. The more enterprises connect their systems of record with their emerging agent ecosystems, the faster their marginal costs fall. This is why we believe the real economic opportunity lies with worker-bee AGI inside the enterprise, not messiah AGI in the labs. The image of windmills and solar farms on our cover slide symbolizes the renewable nature of enterprise data. In the age of AI, algorithms are increasingly commoditized and developed by specialized labs. But shaping data – aligning it with workflows, policies, context and outcomes – is where competitive advantage resides. This brings us to a critical question: Could OpenAI simply partner with leading enterprises to overcome its data disadvantage? In theory, yes. In practice, we see three barriers: In other words, owning a frontier model isn’t enough. To win in the enterprise, the model must be embedded in the workflow to include policy, security, data lineage, context, orchestration, and deterministic logic. This is software, not science, and thus far frontier labs are not enterprise software companies. (Note: Our colleague David Floyer disputes this premise. He believes research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic will build great enterprise software on top of their LLMs and simplify the adoption of enterprise AI. We’ll be digging into and debating this topic with him in future Breaking Analysis episodes.) As a result, the disruption won’t manifest in the technology model alone, rather we’ll see it in the operational and business models of emerging AI software companies – including pricing. The seat-based pricing model that has defined enterprise software for decades will not survive the agentic era, in our view. Infrastructure consumption models will evolve as well. We believe the winners will shift toward value-based/outcome-based pricing aligned with real business results. This is the heart of service-as-software. And AWS – whether intentionally or instinctively – is leaning directly into this shift. It is missing some pieces, however, which we’ll discuss in detail. Let’s park the technology model for a moment and examine the coming changes in the operational and business models of enterprises as a result of AI. As we’ve argued in earlier Breaking Analysis episodes, the shift to AI-driven operations requires a wholesale transformation of how organizations function – not just in their technology stacks, but in their operational and business models. When the industry migrated from on-premises software to software as a service, the burden fell largely on information technology departments and software vendors. Mainstream organizations didn’t have to rethink how their companies worked. This time is different in that the entire organization will change. Practitioners often say the hard part of transformation is people and process, not technology. In the agentic era, all three are hard. The operational model, the business model and the technology model must move in concert, and none of them can remain anchored in legacy assumptions. For six decades – despite new devices, new user interfaces and new software delivery models – the industry continued to build in silos. These were essentially craft cells for knowledge work, each optimized locally because that was the only way we knew how to automate. The shift ahead replaces these craft silos with an end-to-end assembly line for knowledge work. That represents a profound process change. The organizational structures built to make machine-like efficiency possible no longer align with end-to-end outcomes. On the business model side, the shift is equally profound. Traditional software economics were built around nonrecurring engineering or NRE costs. Pricing was often seat-based with added maintenance fees, and steadily improving (and predictable) marginal costs as volume grew. Even in the cloud era, despite variable infrastructure costs, vendors benefited from the same model – upfront NRE, light ongoing maintenance and falling marginal costs as scale increased. AI breaks that pattern. In the new model, organizations deliver outcomes, and pricing will be based on value, usage or direct outcome proxies. More important, the foundation of economic advantage shifts from physical capital and depreciating software assets to digital expertise that compounds. Intelligence becomes capital. The more data that flows through the system, the richer the experience base becomes. Cost advantages and differentiation strengthen simultaneously, creating winner-take-most dynamics. This is where tokens enter the equation. Software companies not only face cloud cost-of-goods-sold, they now incur token costs. Though consumers may benefit from improvements in graphics processing unit price-performance, the marginal economics that once accrued to software vendors increasingly accrue to the organizations that climb the AI learning curve fastest. Getting volume and getting there fast becomes critical; once a company builds compounding advantage through expertise, it becomes extremely difficult for others to catch up. This gets back to the difference between models and agents. The model guys are in this “token grind” where through distillation and advances in the frontier of intelligence, their costs are coming down something like 10 to 30 times per year, some obscene number when it’s just the raw model and the application programming interface. But when it’s an agent and there’s a learning loop in there, their prices are much more stable. And so that gets back to what we’re going to talk about, and where AWS is focused, which is the surrounding scaffolding needed to build, manage and govern agents. The bottom line is the economics of software are being rewritten. Depreciating assets are giving way to compounding expertise, and organizations that build these systems early will gain durable structural advantage. In our view, this shift underpins the emerging service-as-software model – and explains why enterprise AI will look nothing like the transitions of the past. The technology shift unfolding now is far more complex than the move to cloud. The cloud era changed the operational model for running the same application silos – breaking monoliths into microservices but leaving the underlying fragmentation intact. Data remained siloed, and even the application logic itself stayed isolated within domain-specific systems. What is happening now is much different. For decades, enterprises converted data into a corporate asset through the rise of relational databases. That was a significant milestone, but it didn’t unify how businesses reason. In the agentic era, humans and agents need a shared understanding of the rules, processes and semantics that govern the enterprise. That requires constructing a true system of intelligence or SoI – a shared asset that expresses how the business runs. This is something the industry has never done before, and it upends 60 years of accumulated investment in application-centric architectures. Developing a migration path for this transformation is extraordinarily challenging, because every existing enterprise today is built on top of layers of deterministic logic that reflect the constraints of siloed automation. The “Tower of Babel” metaphor on the slide above captures the legacy landscape. Each application has its own language, its own worldview, its own schema. They don’t talk to each other. Even when organizations attempt to consolidate through a lakehouse, the silos reappear inside the lakehouse itself – sales, service, logistics and every other domain carries its own schema, definitions and constraints. Asking cross-functional questions – for example, what happened, why it happened, what should happen next – requires stitching these worlds together with extensive data engineering. This is brittle work, and it reinforces the fragmentation that enterprises are now trying to escape. The move from application-centric silos to a unified, data-centric platform is not simply a technology upgrade. It is a rearchitecture of how intelligence is represented inside the enterprise. And it is this shift that will determine whether organizations can deploy agents that truly understand and drive end-to-end business outcomes. The slide above depicts a dead whale being kicked down the beach – an intentionally stark metaphor for the scale of the challenge ahead. The reference traces back to Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, who once mocked attempts by Lotus and WordPerfect to bolt graphical interfaces onto DOS-era software. He likened that effort to “kicking dead whales down the beach” – an impossible, grinding task weighed down by accumulated legacy code and technical debt. The situation today is exponentially harder. Instead of a single dead whale, the industry faces a thousand. Sixty years of investment in application-centric silos must now be harmonized into a coherent systems of intelligence. Every layer of legacy logic, schema, workflow and domain-specific constraint has to be reconciled. And at this moment, no one vendor has a complete solution for how to do it. The metaphor captures the reality in that preserving compatibility with decades of siloed systems while attempting to build unified, agent-ready architectures is not only difficult – it borders on impossible without rethinking the foundational architecture of the business. The agentic era demands a level of semantic, procedural and data harmonization that legacy architectures were never designed to support. In this next section, we’ll turn to what the broader transformation means for AWS. A series of announcements at re:Invent – general availability milestones, continued investment in Kiro, enhancements across the software development lifecycle, and significant expansions to Nova and Nova Forge – underscore how AWS is positioning itself for the service-as-software era. But before we do that, let’s revisit how we see the emerging technology stack evolving. The slide above depicts the transition from application-centric silos to a data-centric platform. At the base sits the data platform – the logical data estate aggregating information from operational systems, websites and external sources. Vendors such as Snowflake Inc., Databricks, and AWS with its Redshift have done remarkable work consolidating these assets. But consolidation is not the same as harmonization. The data platform remains neither machine-readable nor agent-readable. Even humans often require a business intelligence layer to interpret it. Functionally, these systems provide high-fidelity snapshots of what happened – two-dimensional views constrained by the schemas of each domain. At best, with feature engineering and narrow machine learning, they can forecast what’s likely to happen within a limited scope. What enterprises need next is a true system of intelligence, represented in green on the slide. We’ve discussed previously the need for a four-dimensional, end-to-end map of the business. This is the layer that gives both humans and agents a shared understanding of processes, rules and dependencies. Some organizations attempt to build this today with platforms such as Palantir, but doing so often requires forward-deployed engineers or FDEs crafting bespoke solutions at great expense (~$1 million annually for each FDE). Each customer effectively rebuilds the system from scratch. Above that sits the system of agency, shown in yellow. This is the agent control framework – important for orchestration, policy and workflow activation, but not itself the source of intelligence. It draws meaning from the system of intelligence beneath it. For agents to make decisions with the same contextual awareness humans use today – understanding, for example, how delaying an order for lack of a part could jeopardize a major contract – they must be anchored in a harmonized representation of the enterprise. Without that harmonization, neither humans nor agents can reliably see across domains or reason about second- and third-order effects. Humans can run isolated what-if analyses, but scaling those insights across the full enterprise is impractical when the underlying maps must be stitched together manually. The key point is that the emerging software stack requires customers to transform their technology model. The data platform alone is not enough. Systems of intelligence and systems of agency must work in tandem to provide the end-to-end visibility, shared meaning and decision-making context that define the agentic era. The next question we want to address is how AWS maps onto this architecture – and where its recent announcements signal its intent to lead. With the benefit of four days of re:Invent behind us, a clearer picture emerged of where AWS is investing and how it aligns to the evolving software stack shown above. When mapped against the model of data platforms, systems of intelligence, and systems of agency, the green layer – the system of intelligence – is still largely incomplete. It doesn’t come out of the box. Enterprises such as JPMorgan Chase, Dell Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. itself have had to build it themselves, whereas most mainstream enterprises don’t have the capability to do so. Where AWS is strong today is in the layers surrounding that gap. Bedrock has matured considerably. A year ago, reliability issues – struggles even with two and three nines – triggered urgent internal focus. That work appears to have paid off. Bedrock now serves as the abstraction layer above LLMs that AWS has long needed. AgentCore, introduced as a control framework for building multi-agent systems, shows real promise as well. Even more compelling are AWS’ first-party agents. The Kiro autonomous coding agents, along with new DevOps and security agents, formed some of the most interesting narratives of the week. They still have to earn customer trust, but the conceptual story around them is strong. These agentic capabilities, however, highlight the critical dependency on the missing middle layer. Agents are only as effective as the context they draw from. AI is programmed by data, and without a well-structured system of intelligence to feed them, their potential is limited. At the bottom of the stack, the data platform continues to evolve. SageMaker’s lakehouse features – especially S3’s expansion into table formats such as Iceberg – signal S3’s shift from a simple get/put object store into something more structurally aware. Neptune, AWS’ graph database, receives far less public attention, including its knowledge graph capabilities, yet it represents an important ingredient for shaping contextual data. in our view. This is where the divergence between AWS and Microsoft is instructive. Microsoft prefers to articulate where customers should be three to five years out and seed early product iterations – Fabric IQ being a recent example, potentially even designed to counter Palantir Technologies Inc.’s momentum. AWS, by contrast, tends to stay one step ahead of customers’ stated needs, solving problems incrementally rather than prescribing long-horizon architectures. Even so, Neptune already plays a role in bottom-up AI workload development, helping customers structure data for agentic applications. And one can imagine a future where Neptune joins S3 buckets and S3 tables as a more central mechanism for harmonizing data, though that would represent a strategic evolution for AWS. The broader takeaway is that AWS is prioritizing agent-specific tooling. As Swami Sivasubramanian, Amazon’s vice president of agentic AI, put it in his keynote, the company wants to be “the best place to build agents.” On that dimension, progress is evident and deserving of high marks. But the system of intelligence – the contextual substrate agents depend on – is still an open frontier across the industry. Vendors such as Palantir and Celonis SE operate directly to address this space, but no one vendor has yet solved the problem at scale. AWS may lean on Neptune, expand the capabilities of S3, or take a different path altogether. What’s certain in our view is that the green layer – the harmonized representation of data and process knowledge – is the piece that will ultimately determine how far agentic architectures can go. The DevOps agent emerged last week as one of the most consequential pieces of AWS’ agentic strategy. When mapped onto the emerging software stack – systems of intelligence in green and systems of agency in yellow – the DevOps agent sits in the layer that orchestrates digital operations. Understanding why this matters requires looking at the complexity of modern enterprise estates. A DevOps agent must reason across sprawling, heterogeneous environments composed of infrastructure, middleware, application components and thousands of microservices. Unlike a monolithic system such as SAP, where a single vendor created an end-to-end framework with well-understood internals, AWS environments are far more open-ended. The DevOps agent is designed to look across all of digital operations, identify when something breaks, determine the root cause and, when confidence is high enough, execute a remediation plan – potentially without human intervention. This introduces an important concept in that DevOps agents function as training wheels for the broader system of intelligence. They represent a prototype of what an enterprise-wide reasoning layer could become. Digital operations are only one slice of the problem. The full system of intelligence must encompass all business operations, and that requires a 4D map of the enterprise that shows how systems connect, their dependencies and how actions in one domain influence outcomes in another. AWS described this mapping capability as topology – an attempt to learn a representation of how Amazon services and infrastructure components interrelate. Conversations with vendors such as Datadog Inc., Dynatrace Inc., Splunk Inc. and Elasticsearch B.V. revealed that each has deep visibility into its own domain and partial insight into adjacent ones. Dynatrace, for example, places a probe on every host, enabling it to construct a causal graph – a kind of twin of digital operations. The DevOps agent uses these external views when needed. When it identifies a problem but lacks sufficient visibility to diagnose it, it can call out to partners such as Dynatrace and say, in effect: Run the deeper query for me. This bottom-up collaboration hints at how a general system of intelligence may ultimately emerge – not as a single monolithic product but as an aggregation of increasingly broad platforms across an ecosystem. This raises a broader architectural question related to top-down versus bottom-up approaches. A pure bottom-up approach risks “boiling the ocean” – digging two tunnels from multiple directions without a guarantee that the tunnels meet in the middle. A purely top-down approach lacks grounding in operational reality. The workable model appears to be a hybrid where the the outcome is defined top-down, then stitched together with the necessary data bottom-up to support that outcome. In practice, this might look like deploying the DevOps agent for a specific service area and augmenting it with Dynatrace data to achieve end-to-end visibility. Once that outcome works, extend it incrementally to additional services. This creates the scaffolding for a system of intelligence one outcome at a time – a middle-out expansion if you will, anchored by practical workflows. The DevOps agent therefore serves two purposes: 1) It solves a tangible operational problem today; and 2) It lights the path toward an enterprise-wide intelligence layer that will ultimately govern agentic systems. Kiro, first announced at the AWS Summit in New York, took on new significance last week. Anyone who still believes AWS is behind in AI need only look at the cadence and depth of innovations emerging around Kiro and its autonomous coding capabilities. Despite that, the keynote significantly understated its importance, in our view. Developers we spoke with emphasized that Kiro is quickly becoming central to their workflows. And the reason is that Kiro goes beyond the vibe-coding paradigm that has dominated the last year. Developers, by the way, still love Cursor, which continues to sets the standard. For months, the conversation in AI-assisted development has centered on scaffolding – the supporting structures that transform rapidly evolving models into agentic applications. Tools such as GitHub Copilot pioneered “code complete” – hit tab, finish your line. Cursor advanced the state of the art by customizing the integrated development environment so developers could chat with the agent, enabling longer-horizon tasks. Google’s Antigravity, which came from the Windsurf acquisition, followed the same path. These tools are powerful, but they remain forms of vibe coding. The artifact is still the code. You live in the code. You fix the code. The scaffolding evolves as models advance. Kiro breaks from this model and enters new ground. Instead of writing code and letting the agent assist, Kiro starts upstream – with the requirements document. The agent works at the ideation level, partnering with the developer to flesh out specifications, tighten ambiguities, highlight missing details and introduce best practices. The requirements document then feeds into a design document, creating a clear specification. Only then does Kiro generate code. And crucially, the code is disposable. When the software needs to evolve, you don’t traverse through the codebase trying to predict what will break. You update the requirements, adjust the design and regenerate the code from the spec. This reverses decades of software engineering logic. The artifact is no longer the code – it is the specification. Though Cursor can function similarly, it is still code-first out of the box. Even more striking is the potential impact on legacy systems. AWS’ Transform product can reverse-engineer a design document from an existing codebase. AWS believes it can go further and generate the requirements specification itself. That opens the door to something the vibe-coding world has not addressed – brownfield modernization. Instead of writing elaborate migration plans or manually dissecting aging monoliths, enterprises may be able to produce specifications from legacy code and move forward iteratively, regenerating components as needed. This is why Kiro is so significant, in our opinion. It elevates the abstraction from writing code to defining intent. This aligns with the broader shift toward agents, systems of intelligence, and outcome-oriented architectures. When AWS first introduced Kiro, it gave a nod to vibe coding because it was the trend of the moment. But even then, they hinted that Kiro represented something more. The story last week at re:Invent emphasized this is not another flavor of assisted coding. It is a new model for how software gets built, maintained and evolves. AgentCore emerged as one of the most pivotal announcements of the week because it represents the scaffolding required to make agents production-grade. Bedrock has steadily matured into the foundational abstraction layer for model access, but AgentCore sits alongside it as the operational backbone for multi-agent systems. It is the control infrastructure that governs how agents behave, how they coordinate and how they remain within defined boundaries. AgentCore provides the essentials of memory, runtime services, utilities like code interpreter and – critically – observability and policy enforcement. These capabilities matter because agents are not like traditional software components. Governing a data platform is relatively straightforward. Policies answer simple questions like who can access which data, under what conditions? Even column-based or tag-based controls remain manageable within deterministic systems. Agents are different. They take actions. They chain actions. They invoke tools. They do so with varying parameters, in varied contexts, and with probabilistic reasoning. The policy framework must therefore answer far more complex questions such as: Should this agent be allowed to take this action, with these parameters, in this context, in pursuit of this goal? That level of governance is exponentially more sophisticated than anything required in legacy data or application systems. This is why AgentCore is significant. Putting agents into production requires deterministic enterprise scaffolding – strong guardrails, clear boundaries, actionable observability and the ability to enforce policy across dynamic behaviors. This is heavy enterprise software, not something LLM vendors are likely to deliver. Frontier labs focus on models, not operational governance. Enterprises need a control plane that can manage armies of agents reliably, safely and consistently. Again, this is a debate inside theCUBE Research, which we’ll continue to explore. AgentCore begins to fill this gap. It establishes the governance fabric that agents must operate within and provides the layer into which downstream capabilities – systems of intelligence and systems of agency – will ultimately connect. It is the early architecture of agent-native operations, and AWS appears intent on owning this part of the stack. Among all the news coming out of re:Invent, Nova Forge stands out as the most strategically significant. The framework aligns directly with our thesis that enterprises will differentiate by owning their data, customizing their models, and building systems of intelligence that reflect their proprietary workflows. Nova Forge serves as the mechanism that makes this possible. It is the first offering from a major U.S. vendor that delivers open weights and training data, giving customers the ability to adapt the model to their own environments. The availability of training data is a critical distinction. While startups continue to build on lower-cost open-weight models such as DeepSeek, those offerings generally include weights only – not the underlying data. Nova Forge allows enterprises to substitute, augment or extend the training corpus with their own information, creating a model tuned to their specific context and competitive advantage. This introduces several strategic dynamics. Customizing a model through pretraining or reinforcement learning effectively welds an enterprise to that version of the model. When the next, more capable model arrives months later, the tuning process must be repeated. The complexity is not just operational – it can introduce behavioral instability as models shift. This is why some frontier-model providers, particularly those whose businesses depend on API consumption, actively discourage customers from performing deep reinforcement learning. Their pitch is if you avoid the heavy customization, you sacrifice some tight integration but stay aligned with the rapid improvement cycle of frontier models. This perspective underscores a broader debate about how the enterprise AI stack will evolve. One argument holds that frontier-model companies will become the next great software vendors, providing layers of tooling atop their LLMs to simplify enterprise integration. The counterargument is that mainstream enterprises – and the ISVs serving them – will need far more specialization than a handful of frontier models can deliver. Agents are not just RPA 2.0; they represent much more. As these agents proliferate, organizations will require a diverse portfolio of models, many of them small and highly specialized. In that world, frontier models play a role – but as orchestrators, handling complex planning and reasoning. The bulk of enterprise differentiation will come from customized, specialized models trained on proprietary data. Nova Forge is the first major signal that AWS intends to support this path by delivering open weights, open data and the ability for customers to shape the intelligence layer of their enterprise directly. A major subplot at re:Invent was AWS’ forceful claim that it is the best place to run Nvidia Corp. GPUs. That declaration hits with irony, given the persistent narrative that AWS lacks allocation, faces political challenges with Nvidia, and is focused on its own silicon efforts – Trainium in particular. Meanwhile, public commentary from outlets such as CNBC continues to over-index on competition to Nvidia, framing tensor processing units, Trainium and other accelerators as existential threats. The reality is more nuanced. GPUs are expensive, and performance per watt is the defining metric. Volume determines learning curves. And on that dimension, Nvidia remains in the driver’s seat. High volume gives Nvidia cost advantage, supply advantage and architectural advantage. Unless the company stumbles, the position is theirs to lose. Nvidia also locked up the leading process nodes at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. securing massive capacity. It is reminiscent of Apple Inc. 15 years ago: No competitor could match its handset performance because Apple had tied up the most advanced silicon for entire product cycles. No alternative supplier could close the gap. AWS’ historical challenge in securing Nvidia volume traces back to its own infrastructure strategy. The company spent years building Nitro, designing composable data centers, expanding instance types, optimizing storage and networking, and refining hypervisors. That approach made AWS infrastructure-smart – but not the earliest or largest buyer of full-stack Nvidia systems. When the ChatGPT moment hit, Nvidia wanted to sell integrated data center kits, not just racks. Providers that lacked infrastructure sophistication were forced to buy everything, and in return they received the larger allocations. That included Microsoft and the neoclouds, and Oracle as well – though in Oracle’s case, the scale-up design served the needs of its database architecture. Then came a second, largely unspoken issue: failure rates. For the last 12 months, the volume GPU has been the GB200. Multiple sources reported that failure rates were as high as 50%. No one talked about it publicly. The industry was reluctant to make Nvidia look bad and risk a reduction in allocation. But the implications were that supply would continue to be constrained. This was the year hyperscaler capital spending surged, and Wall Street was left wondering where the returns were. Utilization was low for reasons almost nobody understood externally. The shift began in October, when the GB300 surpassed the GB200 in volume. The GB300 installs more smoothly, runs more reliably and appears to deliver meaningfully higher quality. Neocloud providers such as Lambda reported excellent performance from GB300 systems. As GPU specialists willing to buy full stacks, they secured allocations consistent with that model. This dynamic contributed to the broader narrative of the “GPU-rich” and the “GPU-poor.” The GPU-rich could advance model training, inference and agentic workloads aggressively, while the GPU-poor were stuck rationing capacity. But now the dynamics may change as infrastructure-smart providers – those that invested in custom silicon and composable data centers – begin to leverage their own accelerators for meaningful workloads. There is enough Trainium deployed inside AWS to run frontier models such as Anthropic for inference at scale. Training remains a different story, despite public commitments on both sides. Anthropic’s leadership has acknowledged that training on Nvidia would require far fewer chips, which explains why it negotiated a larger deal with Google to run on TPUs – even as AWS invested billions in the company. Still, TPU volume will remain limited. Google will not match Nvidia’s scale unless Nvidia falters. Nvidia sells to Google’s competitors. Neoclouds depend on Nvidia allocation and are unlikely to compromise it. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft is going to shift to TPUs. Volume determines trajectory, and Nvidia’s volume remains unmatched. Could TPUs create pricing pressure? Possibly. A credible competitor gives buyers negotiating leverage. Nvidia’s 70% margins may face some compression. But the software ecosystem, tooling, libraries, and developer familiarity remain heavily skewed toward Nvidia. The lesson from this week is that AWS is becoming more assertive about the GPU story because it believes its infrastructure – combined with Nitro, Trainium and rapidly improving Nvidia integration – positions it strongly for the next phase of AI infrastructure. But the industry-wide GPU story is more complicated than energy constraints and data center buildouts. It includes an unspoken constraint in that high GPU failure rates, massive CapEx tied up in underutilized infrastructure, and a rapidly maturing next-generation GPU cycle is reshuffling the hierarchy of who is GPU-rich and who is GPU-poor. The slide above tells the story of two worlds. On the left sits the pursuit of messiah-level AGI – the frontier labs chasing grand breakthroughs. On the right is the hard, unglamorous scaffolding required to make AI useful in enterprises. The contrast underscores a fundamental divide. The frontier narrative often centers around singular breakthroughs and personalities, while the enterprise ecosystem is focused on building practical systems. The hyperscalers, ISVs and large incumbents are constructing the heavy scaffolding at both the agent layer and the data layer. AgentCore represents the control and governance framework. But the other half of the equation is even more foundational – bringing together data and action in a consistent, governed system. Actions – meaning tools and callable workflows – must pair with data, which provides the context that guides what an agent should do. When those come together coherently, the result is a knowledge graph, and that “4D Map” becomes the system of intelligence. This is hard enterprise software work, and frontier LLM vendors are not database vendors or workflow vendors. They are a long way from building this substrate. Enterprises that operate at scale – Amazon.com, large banks such as JPMorgan, and major technology firms that include Dell – confirm that they must build this system of intelligence themselves. It does not exist out of the box. Our early work, such as the “Uber for All” model explored years ago, hinted at the idea of people, places, things, activities – drivers, riders, prices, locations – brought together into a unified digital representation of an enterprise. That remains the ambition today: a real-time, four-dimensional map of the business. It’s why the agentic era will take most of a decade to unfold, in our view. Analytics-oriented vendors can provide slices of this capability today, but only within confined analytic domains. Building the full operational twin of the enterprise – harmonized, contextualized and ready for agents – is a far larger undertaking. The slide above shows a camel covered in logos – more logos than a camel has fleas. The image captures the current frenzy. The market’s reaction to the word “agent” has resembled a Pixar moment when someone yells “squirrel,” and the dogs instantly lose focus. In this cycle, someone yells “agent,” and venture capital runs at full speed. The problem is that most of these agent startups are built on only the thinnest layer of scaffolding. Some domain agents – such as those in legal tech – carry embedded knowledge of workflows. But the vast majority lack the heavy lifting required for real enterprise value. They do not solve the integration challenge between data, action space, and governance. They do not provide the agent control apparatus. They do not offer the system of intelligence. The companies doing that work are the hyperscalers and the major software vendors. The differentiation will not come from shiny agent UIs or narrow features. It will come from the depth of integration with data systems, workflow systems and the governance and control planes that bind agents to enterprise policy and process. That’s why this era will be defined not by the number of agents a vendor can showcase, but by the scaffolding that underpins them. And that scaffolding is where the real enterprise value will accrue in our view. The final slide above ties the entire discussion together, showing how the emerging software stack will take shape and where different players fit. The center of gravity – the high-value real estate – is the system of intelligence layer. Companies such as Celonis and Palantir are furthest along, in our view, though they take different approaches. Palantir remains services-heavy but has made significant software advances. Other graph-centric and process-centric vendors such as ServiceNow Inc., SAP SE, Salesforce In. and essentially every SaaS company with embedded process logic, are now targeting this same layer. To participate meaningfully, these players must build out their data platforms and confront a major business-model transition. As they merge process logic with data and enable agents to take increasingly autonomous action, they weaken their traditional seat-based subscription models. This is an innovator’s dilemma in real time. For example a $50 billion dashboard-centric industry (BI) faces disruption. Efforts to introduce “talk to your data” interfaces are part of that response, but they do not change the underlying economics. Below the system-of-intelligence layer sit the data platforms: Snowflake, Databricks and the lakehouse constructs of SageMaker and S3. Above it sits the system of agency – Bedrock and the agent-control frameworks. And throughout the stack, governance is ubiquitous; every major player is adding governance layers to address the risks of agentic systems. Meanwhile, the software development lifecycle is shifting from a linear pre-gen AI workflow to one that is nonlinear, interactive and deeply agent-driven. As the hardware stack is redefined – compute, storage and networking – the entire software stack is being redefined with it. Zooming out from re:Invent 2025 and the broader move toward service-as-software, the momentum feels like early baby steps toward a decade-long transformation. Two major trends are emerging: The bubble is not bursting, but it is growing. There may be some deflation on the consumer side, particularly around OpenAI’s positioning, but enterprise activity is only beginning. Building worker-bee AGI beyond basic RPA 2.0 and microservices 2.0 is a long, challenging road. But the productivity gains across software development and operations tools will be large and immediate. Over time, those agentic capabilities will migrate into every enterprise process, creating the marginal-economics advantage that defines the service-as-software model. The broader market dynamics may feel bubblicious – echoing Ray Dalio’s comment that we’re “80% of the way into the bubble.” Whether that was macro commentary or a push for his preferred trades, the point stands in that bubbles don’t burst until something pricks them. We’re not there yet. History shows pullbacks of 10% or more can happen repeatedly during an expansion, as they did in the dot-com era. Recent market disruptions look more like early tremors than the hard correction that would unwind current valuations. The agentic era is coming. Its shape is becoming somewhat more clear. But the real transformation – the unified data foundation, the system of intelligence, the governed agent layer – will take the better part of a decade to mature.

Shares of Confluent (CFLT) surged Monday morning after IBM (IBM) announced a deal to acquire the software maker for $31 per share, valuing Confluent at $11 billion. Confluent's software helps companies manage and organize large amounts of data, an in-demand service as many companies are looking to manage massive data sets that are used in the training and running of artificial intelligence models. IBM said that Confluent "excels at preparing data for AI, keeping it clean and connected across systems and applications, eliminating silos inherent in agentic AI." IBM said that the company's total addressable market has doubled in the last four years to $100 billion. IBM will acquire Confluent with cash on hand, and said it expects the deal to close by the middle of next year as Confluent's largest shareholders, which control about 62% of the stock's voting power, have agreed to vote in favor of the deal. Confluent shares were up 29% in midday trading Monday. Coming into the week, the stock had lost 17% of its value since the start of the year. The stock of a company being acquired typically surges as investors look to buy in below the announced deal price, $31 per share in Confluent's case. The news of the IBM deal sent Confluent's share price into positive territory for 2025. IBM shares were up 1.5%, boosting the stock's year-to-date gain to 42%. IBM is among the top performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025, trailing only heavy machinery maker Caterpillar (CAT) and investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The deal could be a boost for IBM's software business, which it could use as slowing sales growth in its hybrid cloud segment disappointed investors in its latest earnings report in October. Wedbush analysts said following the announcement that they "believe this acquisition represents a strong move by IBM to continue adding more data processing capabilities to its hybrid cloud ecosystem while driving profitable growth over time." The analysts added that Confluent is "a natural fit for IBM’s long-term growth strategy as the company addresses IBM’s focus on eliminating data silos for powering AI," and said they "loudly applaud" what they expect will be one of more acquisitions to come. The Wall Street Journal had reported late Sunday that the sides were close to a deal. Reports emerged in October that Confluent was considering a sale and working with a bank to sort through its options, from private equity firms to tech companies.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In the first 11 months of the year, the industry has recorded nearly 92,000 job cuts, with over 3,200 in November alone, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas. While announced job cuts in the retail industry grew from October, across all industries job cuts were down more than 50% from last month. “Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008.” Some of retail’s biggest companies have announced significant layoffs in recent months. Target announced in October it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles, representing about 8% of the retailer’s global headquarters workforce. That same month, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 roles in an effort to stay “nimble.” Yankee Candle this month said it would lay off 900 people, about 10% of its global professional and clerical staff. The sector’s early holiday performance, however, may make way for additional hires before the year is over, Challenger said. “The increased spending over the Black Friday and the Thanksgiving weekend may give rise to hires in December right before the holiday,” Challenger said. “It’s unclear, however, if those positions will last into the New Year.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts The problem is growing, though the full impact is unclear, according to speakers at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Aims to Launch FM2, Its Second Prototype Satellite, in January

AST SpaceMobile is hoping to launch a second next-generation prototype satellite "as early as January" as it races to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. The company disclosed the launch timing in a new Federal Communications Commission filing. AST is already on track to launch its first prototype satellite, FM1, later this month. However, it appears that it's also scrambling to launch the FM2 as soon as possible. “As part of its proactive efforts to secure sufficient launches for its satellite constellation on an expedited basis, AST SpaceMobile was able to secure an accelerated launch slot capable of launching a BlueBird satellite as early as January 2026,” the company wrote. Interestingly, AST has tapped rival SpaceX to launch the satellite using a Falcon 9 rocket. But the filing notes: “In order to meet quick turnaround launch requirements, AST SpaceMobile was constrained in the available orbital parameters for launch. The alternative was to forgo the launch opportunity.” The company secured FCC clearance in August to fly up the FM2. However, the "constrained" orbit parameters are leading AST to request regulatory permission to launch the FM2 satellite at a lower orbit, from 520 kilometers down to 460 kilometers. AST describes the lower orbit as part of “a few minor changes” that won’t lead to increased radio interference. “Grant of this application will serve the public interest by facilitating expeditious deployment of a new, groundbreaking space-based cellular network that will deliver direct-to-device broadband connectivity across the United States,” the company added. Still, the company’s application might face opposition from rival companies, such as SpaceX. It could also take time for the FCC to review and clear the application, although the Commission has been working to fast-track satellite approvals. AST’s first prototype, the FM1, is currently scheduled to launch on Dec. 15. The company has tapped India’s space agency to launch the satellite, which is about three times larger than AST's first-generation BlueBirds. The square-shaped satellites have been designed to act as cell towers in space, capable of powering high-speed broadband to phones on the ground. The goal is to operate 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites by the end of next year—enough for the company to provide continuous coverage through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, “AST SpaceMobile expects five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with launches occurring every one to two months on average,” the company told the FCC. Hence, the launch timing is crucial when AST faces heightened competition from SpaceX. The company's own cellular Starlink system launched through T-Mobile earlier this year, and can already power text messaging, app data, and even video calls for phones in cellular dead zones. Now SpaceX is preparing to bulk up the system’s capabilities after acquiring valuable radio spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar. Elon Musk's company has even gone as far as to file the trademark for “Starlink Mobile,” suggesting SpaceX might try to become a global carrier, but primarily through satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years. I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017, where I cover satellite internet services, cybersecurity, PC hardware, and more. I'm currently based in San Francisco, but previously spent over five years in China, covering the country's technology sector.Since 2020, I've covered the launch and explosive growth of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service, writing 600+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights with rival providers like AST SpaceMobile and Amazon, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service. I've combed through FCC filings for the latest news and driven to remote corners of California to test Starlink's cellular service.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Aims to Launch FM2, Its Second Prototype Satellite, in January

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. AST SpaceMobile is hoping to launch a second next-generation prototype satellite "as early as January" as it races to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. The company disclosed the launch timing in a new Federal Communications Commission filing. AST is already on track to launch its first prototype satellite, FM1, later this month. However, it appears that it's also scrambling to launch the FM2 as soon as possible. “As part of its proactive efforts to secure sufficient launches for its satellite constellation on an expedited basis, AST SpaceMobile was able to secure an accelerated launch slot capable of launching a BlueBird satellite as early as January 2026,” the company wrote. Interestingly, AST has tapped rival SpaceX to launch the satellite using a Falcon 9 rocket. But the filing notes: “In order to meet quick turnaround launch requirements, AST SpaceMobile was constrained in the available orbital parameters for launch. The alternative was to forgo the launch opportunity.” The company secured FCC clearance in August to fly up the FM2. However, the "constrained" orbit parameters are leading AST to request regulatory permission to launch the FM2 satellite at a lower orbit, from 520 kilometers down to 460 kilometers. AST describes the lower orbit as part of “a few minor changes” that won’t lead to increased radio interference. “Grant of this application will serve the public interest by facilitating expeditious deployment of a new, groundbreaking space-based cellular network that will deliver direct-to-device broadband connectivity across the United States,” the company added. Still, the company’s application might face opposition from rival companies, such as SpaceX. It could also take time for the FCC to review and clear the application, although the Commission has been working to fast-track satellite approvals. AST’s first prototype, the FM1, is currently scheduled to launch on Dec. 15. The company has tapped India’s space agency to launch the satellite, which is about three times larger than AST's first-generation BlueBirds. The square-shaped satellites have been designed to act as cell towers in space, capable of powering high-speed broadband to phones on the ground. The goal is to operate 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites by the end of next year—enough for the company to provide continuous coverage through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, “AST SpaceMobile expects five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with launches occurring every one to two months on average,” the company told the FCC. Hence, the launch timing is crucial when AST faces heightened competition from SpaceX. The company's own cellular Starlink system launched through T-Mobile earlier this year, and can already power text messaging, app data, and even video calls for phones in cellular dead zones. Now SpaceX is preparing to bulk up the system’s capabilities after acquiring valuable radio spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar. Elon Musk's company has even gone as far as to file the trademark for “Starlink Mobile,” suggesting SpaceX might try to become a global carrier, but primarily through satellites.

Title: Yep, Xbox Is Bleeding Out

Reading time 3 minutes Like the worst sort of father, Xbox doesnât show much care for its youngest consoles anymore, at least judging solely by recent sales data. Black Friday weekend, normally one of the most important for any brand for pre-holiday sales, shows Xbox got beat out by Nintendo, Sony, andâto give the news an ounce of ironyâeven a relatively obscure Kinect-like console. Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at Circana, reported that the PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week console sales, in the U.S. ending Nov. 29. That makes sense, considering the console was on sale for about 40% at some retailers. Sony’s consoleâboth the digital version and one with a disc driveâwas on sale for less than even its pre-hike price. Meanwhile, coming up second was the Nintendo Switch 2 at 24% of total sales. The second-generation handheld console was on sale for $50 off the normally $500 Mario Kart World bundle from Walmart and Amazon. Finally, coming in third was the NEX Playground at 14%. See Xbox Series X and S at Amazon In the US, PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, leading the market. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd (24%), with the NEX Playground 3rd (14%). Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service [image or embed] â Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 6, 2025 at 3:37 PM Whatâs the NEX Playground, you may ask? Itâs an Android-based platform made for younger children. It includes motion sensors that can read body movements for games such as Fruit Ninja or tie-in titles like How to Train Your Dragon: Riders of the Skies. Yes, that’s very much like the long-defunct Kinect. Itâs a very specific kind of console that may make sense for budget-conscious families. Whatâs missing from this pie chart is the Xbox Series S and Series X. Microsoft pushed no sales for its consoles during Black Friday week. Even if some retailers went out of their way to move stock with extra gift cards or game sales, Xbox itself wasnât helping push the needle. The current Xbox Series X costs $650 after this yearâs latest price hike. The same console cost $500 at launch in 2020. Piscatella wrote on Bluesky, âStuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none).â Since the PS5 was the most heavily discounted, it received the lionâs share of additional sales. Xbox either did not think it was necessary to push sales, or the brand just doesnât care anymore. Xboxâs whole strategy is now focused on software. If it does finally release a next-gen Xbox, it will likely be a premium, expensive gaming device made for players who want the very best. That means the Xbox Series consoles donât really have a place anymore. There have been signs that Xbox has been shipping far fewer consoles to retailers, such that Costco removed the companyâs consoles from its U.S. and UK websites. The move toward a software-based gaming ecosystem is inevitably disappointing for Xbox fans. At the same time, the cost of RAM and SSD memory blew past the point of reason several weeks ago, and it keeps getting worse. Burgeoning AI data centers are willing to pay so much for memory that semiconductor companies have created a drought of consumer-ready DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The reliable leaker Mooreâs Law is Dead reported Sony stockpiled enough memory for the short term, but the RAM shortage could last through 2028. Yes, RAM prices could still be out of control a few years from now. Meanwhile, Xboxâs cloud gaming service has reportedly seen an uptick in total usage hours lately. Whether that means there are more people buying into Game Pass is another question entirely. Microsoft hasnât been willing to share total subscriber numbers recently. Thereâs a chance Microsoftâs strategy will win out over the traditionalists like Sony and Nintendo. But for now, its console business is bleeding out so fast, it likely wonât last long. And things aren’t going to get easier for Xbox. Valve is launching its Steam Machine in early 2026 and there will no doubt be all kinds of third-party console-sized PCs of the same ilk.Â When the next-gen Xbox does arrive, it won’t be a battle directly with Sony’s “PS6.” The console wars will have changed by then, with more players fighting for the living room than ever before.

It’s at least the second partnership Invesco has struck since late April, when it joined with Barings on private credit funds. December 8, 2025 (Bloomberg) --Invesco Ltd. is taking another step to expand its presence in private markets, teaming up with LGT Capital Partners on portfolios of alternative assets for US retail and retirement investors. The plan will cover private equity, credit and infrastructure assets as well investments in the market for secondary stakes, the firms said Monday in a statement. It’s at least the second partnership Invesco has struck since late April, when the Atlanta-based firm that manages $2.1 trillion of client assets joined with Barings on private credit funds. “Private markets exposure can provide differentiated sources of income and growth,” Invesco Chief Executive Officer Andrew Schlossberg said in the statement.

Title: AI Might Be Coming for Your Job. There’s a Proven Way to Prevent That.

More middle-age and older Americans are becoming entrepreneurs and seizing control of their careers. The leap can be stressful but ultimately rewarding—just listen to the people who’ve already done it. If the rise of artificial intelligence has you feeling anxious about your professional future, you’re not alone. It seems that every day there’s another article painting a doomsday scenario for the white-collar, professional worker, whose job will be transformed or eliminated in this career apocalypse. A recent Wall Street Journal story made this loud and clear with the headline “Walmart CEO Issues Wake-Up Call: AI Is Going to Change Literally Every Job.” The story’s message: AI will wipe out some jobs and reshape the company’s workforce. The article included a quote from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who said the firm is “exiting” employees who can’t be retrained for the AI age. Meanwhile, Accenture will continue to hire people who are fluent in generative AI and retrain existing workers to serve clients in consulting and other divisions. It strikes me that the veiled reference to exiting employees meant those over the age of 50. It gave me déjà vu of when business leaders said the same thing at the dawn of the digital age. It’s ironic that many of the C-suite leaders making such proclamations are themselves older than 50 and have no real tangible experience with AI. During the digital shift, the rush to hire “digiterati” 20-somethings kicked in at full gear. Ultimately, businesses learned younger employees weren’t the cure-all for their digital strategies, as more seasoned employees with years of experience figured out how to evolve business models into the digital age. As a publishing executive who had to navigate the print-to-digital transformation, I was easily “retrained” in my 50s, as were many of my colleagues. As for the companies hiring people who are supposedly fluent in AI, it’s too early in the artificial-intelligence game. No one of any age has accumulated enough knowledge or experience to be true AI natives. But I’m putting my money on older employees who helped navigate the digital age and ultimately became experts. For people in their 50s, corporate careers can be treacherous waters, complete with “downsizing” and “rightsizing,” reorganizations, budget cuts, divisional closures, mergers and acquisitions, the cost of senior talent, and the antiquated idea of mandatory retirement that still exists in certain professions. Now add the glaring headlines that companies like Target, Amazon, Salesforce, IBM, and others are announcing layoffs, many due to the integration of AI into their businesses, resulting in what they say is the need for fewer employees. In other words, the corporate waters seem more treacherous than ever—but there is a proven way to take control of your career before someone else does it for you. If you are in mid-career, now may be the time to rethink your future. It might also be the moment to embrace your inner entrepreneur. According to a 2019 study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, nearly 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were between 55 and 64, almost double from 20 years prior. A 2018 research report from Pierre Azoulay, Ph.D., a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, found that the average age of a successful start-up founder is 45 and that a 50-year-old founder is 1.8 times as likely to have a hit company as people in other age groups. It makes sense. By 50, you’ve likely amassed expertise, industry knowledge, meaningful contacts, and either your own financial resources or access to investment dollars based on your background. There’s not only a growing body of research on midlife entrepreneurialism but also books and real-life examples to serve as a road map. Kerry Hannon, for instance, is an entrepreneur focused on career and retirement strategies; she’s also a speaker and author of several books for those at midlife thinking of making a change. Her book Never Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life is a meaningful playbook, as is Lynne Beverly Strang’s Late-Blooming Entrepreneurs: Eight Principles for Starting a Business After Age 40. A key lesson from these experts is to have a well-thought-out idea that may be an extension of what you’ve done for a living, a new dimension to your background, or an entirely fresh entrepreneurial idea. Matthew Grzybowski, a Polish-born American with a master’s degree in international business who spent nearly two decades in consulting and working for a wealthy European family office, is a prime example of the midlife entrepreneur spirit. When his wife, Veronica, took a sabbatical from her job as a Polish-Korean translator and discovered her love of dog training, it sparked an idea for both of them. As residents of Southampton, New York, they saw a need for a holistic approach to dog care that included daycare, boarding, training, and the requisite spa with bath, blow-dry, brush, and haircut. All their guests get individual walks and playtime, as they relax in the 17 cabanas for the pups. After two years of planning and the decision to self-fund, Southampton Dog opened in late 2024. The business is already profitable, according to the owners. “It’s a place where dogs learn and people connect,” explained Grzybowski, who's pictured at the top of this story. “We have local firefighters and front-page celebrities who are our clients, and we all bond over the dogs.” The cheery 10,000-square-foot facility is the first of what Matthew and Veronica hope will expand to at least three more locations in the next few years. My friend Steve is another excellent example of an entrepreneur in the making. After earning his M.B.A. at UCLA, he worked in entertainment, media, and data-analytics companies. At the age of 51, he was laid off when his company went through yet another reorganization. Ironically, his last assignment was building an AI-strategy road map for his division. At 52, Steve decided he was done with the corporate world, but he still had years of work ahead of him and decided to take the entrepreneurial path. He signed up for the eight-week MIT online course “Leadership in the AI Age: Driving digital transformation for competitive advantage.” His goal is to lean into his years of business experience, adding his new AI knowledge into a practice that advises C-suite executives on ways to adopt AI into their companies, including retraining all their employees, regardless of their age. These stories help to animate a major trend in America, where 21 percent of the population is over 55. According to SCORE, a resource partner of the Small Business Administration, 50.9 percent of small businesses are owned by this group. John Melia, the founder and executive director of the Wounded Warrior Project, who also had a long career in both the nonprofit and for-profit space, became an entrepreneur in his late 50s, launching Contender Equipment Rentals, a veteran-owned construction-equipment-rental company in Texas. “I felt called to build something new from the ground up,” he said. “The idea came from my time in the oil and gas company, where I worked in telematics and sold to rental companies. I realized I had the mindset, the drive, and the operational understanding to start a company of my own.” His advice to anyone over 50 thinking of launching a business is to do it—but do it wisely. Life experience, emotional intelligence, and a strong filter for what matters are important ingredients for success, according to Melia. As life expectancies grow, the idea of retiring at 65 is becoming an outdated concept. If you are that age and healthy, you may live another 30 years. It’s the perfect time to realize that entrepreneurialism has no real age limitations. Luciano Bernardini de Pace had a long career selling advertising in Milan (including for this magazine). In his late 60s, he returned to his hometown in the Puglia region of Italy. There he started an Italian pasta company called Luciano.Market, tapping his media background to spread the word digitally, including videos on YouTube and TikTok. He also restored a palazzo in Bagnolo del Salento, renamed Palazzo Bernardini de Pace, a luxury mansion that he has turned into a boutique hotel. According to Bernardini de Pace, he never really thought about his age. He had an idea that he was passionate about and took the risk. For David Harrison, it was his age that led him to entrepreneurism. As a United Airlines international first officer pilot on the 787 Dreamliner, he is required to retire at 65. His entrepreneurial leap has been to go back to school to earn a master’s degree in wealth management at Columbia University’s School for Professional Studies.

At 88, he was the oldest participant in the New York City Marathon in 2022. A year later, he got remarried. Becoming an entrepreneur at midlife can be both exhilarating and challenging, but for most who have taken the leap, they often ask, “What took me so long?” If the AI revolution is coming after your job, now might be the time to get ahead of it with your own entrepreneurial idea. And yes, you may have to integrate AI into your own business, but there is a big distinction. At least you’ll own your company and never have to worry about that meeting with your boss when you enter the room and the human-resources person is sitting there too.

(NASDAQ: GOOG) Robotics News: Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That’s the foundation of Google DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that “think” before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics. The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. “Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task,” said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind.

Title: I was an ambitious Amazon exec who solved my burnout without skipping a beat at work. Here's how.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-exec-burnout-recovery-tips-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-08T10:11:15Z
Full Content:
It was Friday afternoon, and I'd just hit send on my weekly report to Amazon's Retail vice presidents, detailing what the Global Merchandising team I'd created had accomplished that week. I was 38, and the role — which oversaw standards, best practices, and technology for Amazon's 200+ site merchandisers — was the biggest of my life by far, one I'd been thrust into just three months after my arrival in Seattle and at Amazon. I was thrilled (and a bit terrified) by the size of the opportunity, and threw myself into it. Two years in, my team had 18 sizable projects underway. We accomplished so much that documenting our progress in that weekly email took me hours — and yet in two years, I'd rarely received so much as a "thx" in return. "At Amazon, silence from the top means you're doing a good job," a colleague reminded me, with rueful humor. She was right. But the feedback vacuum made it increasingly difficult to know if I was fulfilling my mandate. Was I moving fast enough? Still aligned with their priorities? Anxiety filled the void. I pushed myself and my team harder and took on even more. This is the first installment of Business Insider's five-part series, The Burnout Cure, which examines how people recognize burnout, confront it, and rebuild their lives on the other side. I'd once been someone with passions — yoga, reading, arthouse movies — but all of that had faded. When I did find time for something I enjoyed, I was distracted, worried that I'd miss an urgent email. It felt easier to stay vigilant at all times. As I stared at my email that day, I thought, None of this actually matters — followed by the sense that I had to keep pushing forward anyway. That if I slowed down even a little, my career would collapse. Later in the parking garage, I stared numbly at the car in front of me when it hit me: Is this what burnout feels like? It was. I just hadn't realized it could happen to me. I was a naturally driven person who liked being busy; I thought burnout was for the weak. And at work, it was hard to distinguish between burning out and just keeping up. In school and at other jobs, I'd often wished that other people would think bigger and move faster; now I was surrounded by smart, fun, driven coworkers on that same wavelength. I rarely had a moment of boredom at Amazon, and I loved that. But there was a dark side. Add in scarce resources, time pressure, and our inability to say no — to our bosses, to each other, and to ourselves — it was a recipe for exhaustion. I'd been raised to believe I could do anything if I only tried hard enough. That worked out pretty well when it was roller skating or long division, but it started to work against me by high school. When I earned my first Cs, I saw it as a failure of willpower, not a sign that I had strengths and weaknesses like any other human. I carried that harsh self-judgment through college and grad school and into the working world. My version of self-care was drinking white wine and shopping, which often drained me further. When it dawned on me that I was burned out, I was finally able to face it. And over the next months, without ever saying a word about burnout to my boss or co-workers, I slowly pulled myself back to health. Here's what I did to get there. Shopping is fun, but what I really needed were things like sleep and food. I started reading novels before bed instead of emails. I made a point of eating lunch every day, even if it was at my desk. Occasionally, I snuck out for a short walk around the block. The views and movement left me calmer. I waited for my gentler lifestyle to blow up in my face — all that time working at a frantic pace had convinced me that slowing down would backfire terribly. But nothing happened. It didn't seem like anyone at work even noticed, though my husband and dog did, and I even passed the occasional coworker on a walk outside the building. The stories I'd told myself about being "found out" hadn't been based in reality. I couldn't change Amazon's culture of overwork, but I could dial back some of the work I volunteered for to be helpful and prove my worth. I was someone who'd rarely turned down ad hoc committees or mentorship requests, especially when it could help elevate women. But those "after-school" assignments did little to advance my career. At performance review time, all that really mattered was what I'd done to grow the business. I decided that unless an opportunity offered a clear benefit not just to Amazon but to me —or unless it was important to my boss, whom I trusted — I'd turn it down. I felt like a selfish jerk at first, but once again, the sky didn't fall. People simply moved to the next candidate on the list. When I did say yes, I was more engaged and effective, sitting in hiring loops for teams I was curious about and joining occasional projects to work alongside former colleagues. Fun counts as a benefit, and pleasure helps cure burnout. A day where I laughed a lot, did work that fascinated me, or simply learned something new was a day where I got something instead of just giving. A fear of embarrassment or failure at work meant I was always ready with a fast response to any executive's question, but it also kept me from challenging myself in new ways. To keep stakes low, I began looking for modest challenges outside work that I could squeeze into small pockets of time, like learning to solve British-style crosswords or making a soufflé. Later, I added Italian lessons, trained for a half-marathon, and joined the board of a local nonprofit serving prison inmates. My "electives," as I thought of them, became a safe place to make and learn from rookie errors, reminding me that being a beginner is exhilarating — and that I was more than just my job. I found a therapist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy who showed me how to distinguish between passing thoughts and objective reality. When I thought, "If I say no to this project, someone will think I'm lazy," I learned to ask questions: Did I have evidence of that happening in the past? How about evidence of saying no and still being respected? If someone did think I was lazy, how might I cope? What would I say to a friend with the same worry? I still experienced panicky feelings, but I stopped mistaking them for facts. My comeback from burnout was imperfect and sometimes halting. At times, it scared me to feel calm and well, so I'd dive back into frantic overwork — only to learn all over again that I wasn't more effective that way, just busier. I never worked up the courage to talk to my managers or peers about burnout, even though signs of it were everywhere. In a culture where exhaustion and overwork were worn as badges of honor, I feared that even broaching the topic would mark me as lazy or weak. As a leader, I wish I'd had the courage to push for a broader dialogue about burnout, but I also understand why it didn't feel safe. In an era of mass layoffs, I hear from tech workers who feel pushed to work harder and longer than ever before to avoid losing their jobs. They know they need to pull back, but they're afraid. I have two pieces of advice for people in that situation. The first is to recognize that pushing through burnout won't make you better at your job. The numb, frightened, sleepless version of you can't fire on all cylinders, which could put your job at risk. Prioritizing your own basic needs can be scary, but it's critical. Second, understand that small steps matter. Maybe you're not in a position to turn down extra assignments; maybe the thought of adding an Italian class or half-marathon to your life makes you laugh hysterically to keep from crying. But you can make sure to eat lunch. You can carve out a three-minute breathing space to calm your nervous system. (No one can find you in a restroom stall.) You can run modest experiments, like closing your email after a certain time in the evening, just to see how it goes. Pick something to try, and once it becomes a habit, add something else. The benefits will slowly accumulate, and you'll begin to recognize yourself again. Amazon did not provide a comment for this story. Kristi Coulter spent 12 years at Amazon and left in 2018.

Title: Sony PS5 beats Nintendo Switch 2 to become the best-selling gaming console during Black Friday 2025

Black Friday 2025, while marred by unfortunate events like crazy RAM prices, brought us a ton of great tech deals. Gaming laptops, GPUs, smartphones, wireless earbuds, and virtually every other consumer tech category enjoyed some great discounts. This also includes home gaming consoles, where Sony dropped prices of all PlayStation 5 models for Black Friday. It appears that Sony’s strategy of reducing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles worked quite well, as the PS5 was reportedly the best-selling gaming console in the US during Black Friday 2025. According to data collected by Circana, the Sony PS5 accounted for 47% of the total gaming console volume moved during Black Friday 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2 was the second-best-selling console at 24%. What’s more interesting is that the third place was occupied by the Nex Playground. For the uninitiated, the Nex Playground is a motion-controlled, $249.99 gaming console meant for the entire family. The game library of Nex Playground is catered towards all age groups. So, the console primarily appeals to parents who want to buy a kid-safe console without spending a ton of cash. Another interesting, or worrying, observation here is that neither the Xbox Series X nor the cheaper Xbox Series S appears in the top three best-selling consoles on Black Friday. It is becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft doesn’t really care about the Xbox hardware, as the Xbox console business is in a pretty sad state. We’ve seen repeated price bumps, the closing down of studios like The Initiative, cancellation of in-development games, and mass layoffs. While the company has confirmed that there will be next-gen AMD-powered Xbox consoles, the current state of Xbox doesn’t inspire much confidence in the brand’s future.

Title: Todd Howard says AI is only a ‘tool,’ emphasizes human creativity as Bethesda avoids AI-generated game content

The creative force behind Bethesda Game Studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, Todd Howard, delved into the questionable role of artificial intelligence in game development. The studio director framed it as an invaluable tool while also emphasizing the need for human creativity. Todd Howard discussed this at a promotional event for the second season of Amazon’s Fallout adaptation, which is scheduled to premiere later this month. Howard spoke to Eurogamer’s social producer Mat Jones about the show's expansion into new settings and references to New Vegas. During the conversation, the interview pivoted to AI. Todd Howard said: I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.” He clarified in the interview that Bethesda isn’t using AI as a means for content generation but to streamline internal workflows. Todd looked back and drew a parallel between Photoshop and AI. He said, “I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn’t want to go back to that version of Photoshop.” He believes that AI allows developers to improve efficiency in development processes without compromising on creativity. He further elaborated: But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. Howard’s comments about AI come at a turning point in the gaming industry, where many developers have sought to use AI to boost profitability, but this has led to widespread layoffs. To put things into perspective, a Google Cloud survey conducted in August 2025 found that 90% of game developers are already using AI in their workflows to automate repetitive tasks and cut costs. 95% of developers using AI stated that AI reduces the monotony of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of video games. A staggering 94% expect AI to reduce the overall cost of developing games in the long run. Howard concluded the interview, stating, “That’s our view on it. We want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.” Buy the Fallout: Season One Amazon Exclusive Steelbook bundle on Amazon Eurogamer

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Overheard at DPMS — How agencies grapple with AI in programmatic

Time Published: 2025-12-08T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It can sometimes be a fine line between a promise and a threat — but that’s where generative AI stands in its application to the media agency world today. At least that’s the biggest takeaway from a Town Hall discussion at last week’s Programmatic Marketing Summit, held in New Orleans as the last of Digiday’s events for the year 2025. Held under Chatham House rules, which provide anonymity and the freedom to speak freely for the media agency people attending, the Town Hall conversation highlighted the confusion and complexity surrounding the intersection of programmatic advertising and agentic AI. There were differing opinions over to what extent AI and agentic technologies are already part of programmatic workflows (and there seemed to be no consensus definition for what qualifies as agentic). What the agency executives did seem to agree on, though, was that AI agents are best kept away from the actual point of transaction between media buyers and sellers. Instead they should be relegated to pre- and post-transaction tasks, like helping to plan campaign parameters and to organize post-campaign performance data. But even that level of AI involvement will require enhanced training of agency employees not just on AI tools (and their limitations) but also on the fundamentals of programmatic advertising workflows for the human employees to better supervise their AI counterparts. The following has been edited for space and clarity. Setting the stage “I think we all know that machine learning AI … from a buying standpoint is already very integrated. But I think what is new is the gen AI, right? And that’s what’s exciting. The agent idea, and this idea of ideation creating autonomy is where it’s evolving. But I don’t think we all know what we’re talking about, just because it is already integrated within buying across Meta, Google, etc. But from a gen AI aspect, I think that’s what’s really exciting. Where we’ve seen efficiencies in terms of our AI that we’re using is helping with media mix models planning. That really helps with efficiencies, as well as automation in general, in terms of administrative tasks, analytics, and aggregating data.” AI used as a smoke screen “Every agency has some level of machine learning being used in their algorithms and optimizations. We’re not afraid of that, but it isn’t very transparent by nature. One of the challenges we face in this industry is now we’re being fed AI as a cover for more opaqueness in pricing, more opaqueness in performance optimizations. Whether it’s [The Trade Desk’s] Kokai’s new algorithms all trying to do stuff for you and saying ‘Just trust us.’ That, I think scares us, because we know it’s not LLMs, but we also know they’re using it as a smoke screen, and we’re not all equipped to poke holes in their theories and push back. I think that might be where a lot of the fear is, because we just see more opaqueness and us having less and less control.” “We have not gotten there yet, but one of the things that we’re working on on our agency is, how do we use the agentic AI to help us explain what AI is doing in our campaigns? But how do we get it to explain stuff? Because if a person makes an optimization, you can say, Why did you make that optimization? What do you think it was going to do? And what did it do? AI doesn’t do that — it just makes the optimization and has a result or doesn’t have a result.” Careful with that agent, Eugene “Agents are built for fetching and gathering. That’s what they do good. They don’t think. You just asked why — they don’t do that. They’re all probabilistic anyway. Technically agents are [Las] Vegas on all the things you’re looking to track, and it tries to get to a better result based on what it’s seen in the past. So if you’re doing something new right now with the agent, don’t do that. They’re not really good at that yet, because they’re working on odds. I feel like we’re probably three or four years away from trusting any of these things.” “AI can be really good for things with defined parameters. But as an industry, we’re kind of lumping in a lot of AI together. For, say, a programmatic media plan, it’s going to potentially hallucinate because things like outdated information aren’t being taken down from the web, and it’s taking that into consideration. If you just let it to its own devices, you’re not going to get best results. But if you use a very clean data set to find parameters of how things should be evaluated, I think it can be very beneficial.” What’s to come? “From the strategist side, some of the programmatic partners actually have tools that will build your whole media plan, right? But what I haven’t seen is the integration being there. I think their dream of it is, click the one button that builds the plan for you and optimizes the plan. I don’t think that’s upon us yet, but I think that’s what may be coming for us.” “All of us are being told that’s what people want — let’s do that. But then you have legal compliance, and your finance team. All it takes is for the AI to hallucinate one zero, and you’re in big trouble. And that’s one mistake that’s going to cost you potentially a client, or could cost you your job. Because LLMs will never NOT hallucinate — their underlying architecture design has that flaw. I don’t know how many trillions of dollars have been invested in this, but they haven’t fixed this problem. They’re like a very smart intern — we’re going to give it information. It’s going to be able to do a lot of tasks that are menial and take a lot of time, and do it fast. But before we do action, we’re going to put it through some of the older models, or sometimes trust the older models to do the actual heavy lifting, because they have experience. We know they work, and we know they can work and they can do it better.” “You were saying smart intern — it’s a six year old. Think of it as your six year old child who will give you an answer whether it’s right or not, because they want to prove to you that they think what you said is important. That’s AI right now. It’ll be different later, but right now, it’s a six year old.” “We’re using AI in pre- and in post-production. Your whole planning team is pre-production. Your analytics team is post production, giving reports back. That is a lot of the day to day job, so that can save us a ton of time. The actual production part is actually a small percentage of our time. We set up the campaign, we run it, the optimizations come from post analytics, and then we go and make the changes. A lot of the lead up is a lot of time that AI can save us.” Accountability “Accountability comes with management not allowing people to use, ‘Well, that’s what the AI gave me’ as an excuse. They have to be accountable to their work no matter how it’s been generated. And I think that’s how we have to move forward. Because if we allow everyone to use that as an excuse, that we’re going tons of errors.” “My concern is on [the 25-year-old media planner’s] over-reliance on AI for doing a lot of these things. Is that going to impact overall foundational knowledge that allows them to make these strategic decisions creatively and out of the box? Because they’ve been brought up [thinking] ‘Well, I can just do all of these things by throwing it in here.’ They don’t understand the why behind it, and then it snowballs 20 years from now.” How to train your AI “How would you train the AI better? The best way I can describe it is, it’s like good barbecue — low and slow. Use older data that’s very specific. It probably comes in slower than what you’re getting from signal-based data, or real-time data and all the rest of that. Not necessarily because it’s better, but because it has less garbage in it.” Does the need to market as aggressively as possible during the holidays offer an opportunity for retail media networks and challenger social platforms to capture more holiday and 2026 ad dollars? The answer is yes — if they can close the measurement and trust gap, according to new research from Kantar. Some supporting stats: “This merger is a reminder that scale doesn’t fix fragmentation. AI only works when the underlying customer data is unified, governed, and understood. The organizations that win in the next phase of marketing won’t be the ones with the most tools — they’ll be the ones with the clearest picture of their customers.” Programmatic mix will broaden, while AI investment will both drive ad investment and steal focus from other marketing priorities.

Title: OpenAI goes from stock market savior to burden as AI risks mount

Wall Street’s sentiment toward companies associated with artificial intelligence is shifting, and it’s all about two companies: OpenAI is down, and Alphabet Inc. is up. The maker of ChatGPT is no longer seen as being on the cutting edge of AI technology and is facing questions about its lack of profitability and the need to grow rapidly to pay for its massive spending commitments. Meanwhile, Google’s parent is emerging as a deep-pocketed competitor with tentacles in every part of the AI trade. “OpenAI was the golden child earlier this year, and Alphabet was looked at in a very different light,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. “Now sentiment is much more tempered toward OpenAI.” As a result, the shares of companies in OpenAI’s orbit — principally Oracle Corp., CoreWeave Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., but also Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and SoftBank, which has an 11% stake in the company — are coming under heavy selling pressure. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s momentum is boosting not only its stock price, but also those it’s associated with like Broadcom Inc., Lumentum Holdings Inc., Celestica Inc., and TTM Technologies Inc. Read More: Alphabet’s AI Strength Fuels Biggest Quarterly Jump Since 2005 The shift has been dramatic in magnitude and speed. Just a few weeks ago, OpenAI was sparking huge rallies in any company related to it. Now, those connections look more like an anchor. It’s a change that carries wide-ranging implications, given how central the closely held company has been to the AI mania that has driven the stock market’s three-year rally. “A light has been shined on the complexity of the financing, the circular deals, the debt issues,” Ewing said. “I’m sure this exists around the Alphabet ecosystem to a certain degree, but it was exposed as pretty extreme for OpenAI’s deals, and appreciating that was a game-changer for sentiment.” A basket of companies connected to OpenAI has gained 74% in 2025, which is impressive but far shy of the 146% jump by Alphabet-exposed stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index is up 22%. The skepticism surrounding OpenAI can be dated to August, when it unveiled GPT-5 to mixed reactions. It ramped up last month when Alphabet released the latest version of its Gemini AI model and got rave reviews. As a result, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman declared a “code red” effort to improve the quality of ChatGPT, delaying other projects until it gets its signature product in line. Alphabet’s perceived strength goes beyond Gemini. The company has the third highest market capitalization in the S&P 500 and a ton of cash at its disposal. It also has a host of adjacent businesses, like Google Cloud and a semiconductor manufacturing operation that’s gaining traction. And that’s before you consider the company’s AI data, talent and distribution, or its successful subsidiaries like YouTube and Waymo. “There’s a growing sense that Alphabet has all the pieces to emerge as the dominant AI model builder,” said Brian Colello, technology equity senior strategist at Morningstar. “Just a couple months ago, investors would’ve given that title to OpenAI. Now there’s more uncertainty, more competition, more risk that OpenAI isn’t the slam-dunk winner.” Read More: Alphabet’s AI Chips Are a Potential $900 Billion ‘Secret Sauce’ Representatives for OpenAI and Alphabet didn’t respond to requests for comment. The difference between being first or second place goes beyond bragging rights, it also has significant financial ramifications for the companies and their partners. For example, if users gravitating to Gemini slows ChatGPT’s growth, it will be harder for OpenAI to pay for cloud-computing capacity from Oracle or chips from AMD. By contrast, Alphabet’s partners in building out its AI effort are thriving. Shares of Lumentum, which makes optical components for Alphabet’s data centers, have more than tripled this year, putting them among the 30 best performers in the Russell 3000 Index. Celestica provides the hardware for Alphabet’s AI buildout, and its stock is up 252% in 2025. Meanwhile Broadcom — which is building the tensor processing unit, or TPU, chips Alphabet uses — has seen its stock price leap 68% since the end of last year. OpenAI has announced a number of ambitious deals in recent months. The flurry of activity “rightfully brought scrutiny and concern over whether OpenAI can fund all this, whether it is biting off more than it can chew,” Colello said. “The timing of its revenue growth is uncertain, and every improvement a competitor makes adds to the risk that it can’t reach its aspirations.” In fairness, investors greeted many of these deals with excitement, because they appeared to mint the next generation of AI winners. But with the shift in sentiment, they’re suddenly taking a wait-and-see attitude. “When people thought it could generate revenue and become profitable, those big deal numbers seemed possible,” said Brian Kersmanc, portfolio manager at GQG Partners, which has about $160 billion in assets. “Now we’re at a point where people have stopped believing and started questioning.” Kersmanc sees the AI euphoria as the “dot-com era on steroids,” and said his firm has gone from being heavily overweight tech to highly skeptical. “We’re trying to avoid areas of over-hype and a lot of those were fueled by OpenAI,” he said. “Since a lot of places have been touched by this, it will be a painful unwind. It isn’t just a few tech names that need to come down, though they’re a huge part of the index. All these bets have parallel trades, like utilities, with high correlations. That’s the fear we have, not just that OpenAI spun up this narrative, but that so many things were lifted on the hype.” OpenAI’s public-relations flaps haven’t helped. The startup’s Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar recently suggested the US government “backstop the guarantee that allows the financing to happen,” which raised some eyebrows. But she and Altman later clarified that the company hasn’t requested such guarantees. Then there was Altman’s appearance on the “Bg2 Pod,” where he was asked how the company can make spending commitments that far exceed its revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer — I just, enough,” was the CEO’s response. Read More: Sam Altman’s Business Buddies Are Getting Stung Altman’s dismissal was problematic because the gap between OpenAI’s revenue and its spending plans between now and 2033 is about $207 billion, according to HSBC estimates. “Closing the gap would need one or a combination of factors, including higher revenue than in our central case forecasts, better cost management, incremental capital injections, or debt issuance,” analyst Nicolas Cote-Colisson wrote in a research note on Nov. 24. Considering that OpenAI is expected to generate revenue of more than $12 billion in 2025, its compute cost “compounds investor nervousness about associated returns,” not only for the company itself, but also “for the interlaced AI chain,” he wrote. To be sure, companies like Oracle and AMD aren’t solely reliant on OpenAI. They operate in areas that continue to see a lot of demand, and their products could find customers even without OpenAI. Furthermore, the weakness in the stocks could represent a buying opportunity, as companies tied to ChatGPT and the chips that power it are trading at a discount to those exposed to Gemini and its chips for the first time since 2016, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis. “I see a lot of untapped demand and penetration across industries, and that will ultimately underpin growth,” said Kieran Osborne, chief investment officer at Mission Wealth, which has about $13 billion in assets under management. “Monetization is the end goal for these companies, and so long as they work toward that, that will underpin the investment case.”
