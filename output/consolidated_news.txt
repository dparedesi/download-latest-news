At the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns about the increasing dominance of institutional giants like BlackRock over cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH. He emphasized that this growing influence could potentially lead to significant challenges for the decentralized nature of these networks. Buterin was prompted to address this issue during a discussion on the implications of institutional interest, especially following BlackRock’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. He questioned how the cryptocurrency community could safeguard against being “captured” by large entities such as BlackRock, highlighting a pressing concern about the future of decentralization in the space. Buterin also expressed apprehension that if institutional players continue to expand their Ethereum holdings, those who prioritize decentralization might find themselves marginalized. This situation could result in fundamental changes to the Ethereum network, optimizing it for institutional needs and making it increasingly difficult for everyday users to operate nodes. Buterin warned, “It easily drives other people away,” further stating the necessity of concentrating on attributes that would typically be scarce, such as creating a global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol. This week, BlackRock made headlines by registering a staked Ethereum fund in Delaware, indicating its intention to enter the staked Ethereum ETF market. Their flagship Ethereum ETF currently manages approximately $10 billion worth of ETH tokens. In addition to the concerns surrounding institutional involvement, the specter of quantum computing looms large over the future of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recently, Google announced a breakthrough in quantum computing capabilities, following similar advancements at Microsoft, which unveiled a new quantum-enabling chip earlier this year. Quantum researcher Scott Aaronson noted the alarming potential for quantum computers to execute Shor’s algorithm, which could compromise the encryption standards securing Bitcoin and Ethereum. He suggested that the current pace of hardware innovation might lead to the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer before the next US presidential election, escalating the urgency around potential vulnerabilities in blockchain technology. “We don’t need to panic, but we need to get serious,” asserted Alex Pruden, CEO of quantum computing risk company Project 11. He cautioned that sufficiently advanced quantum computers could break cryptocurrencies at their most fundamental level. As the discussion shifts toward the need for proactive measures, Bitcoin developers have also been urged to prepare for a post-quantum future, which some experts predict could materialize as early as 2030. Théau Peronnin, CEO of Alice & Bob, advised during the Web Summit conference in Lisbon that developers should consider transitioning to a stronger blockchain by 2030 to safeguard against potential quantum threats. “You should have a few good years ahead of you, but I wouldn’t hold my Bitcoin,” he warned, emphasizing the importance of addressing these challenges head-on.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B

Time Published: 2025-11-21T09:05:15Z

BlackRock’s IBIT drives November’s record ETF outflows, bleeding $2.47 billion and accounting for 63% of the $3.79 billion withdrawn from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw another sharp reversal on Thursday, erasing a brief moment of relief earlier in the week. After breaking a five-day outflow streak with $75.4 million in inflows on Wednesday, the funds were hit with fresh redemptions of $903 million Thursday — the biggest outflow day in November and one of the largest single-day outflows since the products were launched in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. The $3.79 billion withdrawal puts November on track to be the worst month on record for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF outflows if the remaining days fail to offset this month’s redemptions. The figure has already surpassed February’s $3.56 billion, which held the record for the largest monthly outflow since the ETFs debuted. Investment giant BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF is the largest driver of the historic November outflows. The product has seen $2.47 billion in net redemptions so far this month, accounting for roughly 63% of the total $3.79 billion withdrawn from all US spot BTC ETFs. The fund also led this week’s outflows with $1.02 billion. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of analytics platform CryptoQuant, flagged this week’s performance as IBIT’s “largest weekly outflow ever.” Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed as the second-largest outflow driver in November with monthly outflows of $1.09 billion. Just this week, the issuer has seen $225.9 million withdrawn so far, reflecting moderate but persistent redemptions. While FBTC’s outflows remain smaller than IBIT’s, both funds contributed to the broader liquidity drain that pushed November past February’s record for the heaviest month of Bitcoin ETF outflows. Together, they account for 91% of total US spot BTC ETF outflows in November. Related: Bitcoin won’t hit $200K until Q3 2029: Veteran trader Peter Brandt According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin fell to $83,461 on Friday, following the nearly $1 billion in ETF outflows. The drop pushed BTC to its lowest level in seven months, a price zone last seen in April. Industry voices say the downturn may only be the start. Alliance DAO co-founder QwQiao reposted his warning in September, arguing that the next bear market may be harsher than expected. “There’s a large cohort of dumb money who know nothing about crypto buying DATs and ETFs. This never ends well,” he wrote, adding that markets may need to endure another “50% drawdown” before a durable foundation can be formed. Chris Burniske, the co-founder of crypto venture firm Placeholder, said that the era of DAT selling has only begun,” cautioning that just as ETFs and digital asset treasuries (DATs) amplified Bitcoin’s ascent, they could equally intensify the move downward. DefiLlama data shows that DAT inflows dropped to $1.93 billion in October, an 82% decrease from September’s $10.89 billion. Data showed that inflows significantly decreased after about $20 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in October. At the time of writing, DAT inflows have only reached $505 million. At this rate, November is on track to become the lowest month for DAT inflows in 2025.

Title: HelloTrade, Founded by Former BlackRock Crypto Leaders, Announces Fundraise to Unlock Global, Frictionless Access to Global Equities

November 21, 2025 03:00 ET | Source: HelloTrade HelloTrade New York, NY,, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HelloTrade, a new blockchain-powered trading platform founded by former BlackRock crypto directors Wyatt Raich and Kevin Tang, announced that it has closed a $4.6M seed round led by Dragonfly Capital. The round came together in under a week, reflecting strong conviction in the size of the market opportunity and the team’s track record building category-defining products. At BlackRock, Kevin and Wyatt launched the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the fastest ETF in history to reach $100B in assets. For decades, access to the world’s capital markets and leveraged equity trading has been constrained by geography, high capital requirements, complex derivatives, and legacy brokerage systems. These barriers have made obtaining directional exposure and leverage to global equities challenging for retail and professional investors. HelloTrade aims to change that. Built on MegaETH, the platform will let users everywhere gain leveraged exposure to stocks, ETFs, commodities, and crypto. The app is designed for everyday investors with a mobile first experience, removing the usual points of friction that come with crypto trading. There is no wallet setup, no gas payments, and no technical jargon. Users simply open the app and trade with the speed of a traditional brokerage platform, enabled by MegaETH’s ability to process more than one hundred thousand transactions per second. “Trading stocks with leverage shouldn’t be gated by geography or account minimums,” said co-founder Kevin Tang. “We’ve now seen how crypto derivatives transformed access to digital assets. HelloTrade applies that same ethos to traditional equities, making it possible for investors around the world to participate in the world’s most dynamic markets”. The company is supported by a strong group of advisors, including Arthur Hayes (Maelstrom), Josh Lim (FalconX), David C. (LeadBlock Partners & LeadBlock Bitpanda Ventures), Larry Florio (Ethena), and Andrew Saunders (Amazon). “While leading the engineering team for BlackRock’s Digital Assets Lab, I had the privilege of building IBIT, ETHA, and BUIDL, some of the largest cryptoasset products in the world. That experience highlighted a tremendous opportunity to bring the same trust, discipline, and institutional standards we upheld at BlackRock to the rest of the world and build something truly transformative with HelloTrade,” said co-founder Wyatt Raich, and prior head of digital assets engineering at BlackRock. About HelloTradeKevin and Wyatt first crossed paths at BlackRock as foundational team members in the firm’s digital assets division. Despite their different backgrounds-Kevin as a financial services veteran with over 12-years experience, and Wyatt coming from a career in AI and robotics at Lockheed Martin-the two shared a conviction that blockchain technology could transform capital markets and investing. HelloTrade is expected to launch in the form of a mobile app across both iOS and Android. For early access, a waitlist is currently live at hello.trade.Disclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Title: Dollar hedging frenzy fades, bringing relief to greenback

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar notes are seen in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Refiles to add ANALYSIS tag back, no changes to text) By Alun John and Naomi Rovnick LONDON :Just months after a U.S. tariff shock whacked the dollar, a rush by overseas investors to protect U.S. holdings from the sliding currency has slowed sharply - a vote of confidence that's helping the greenback recover from its worst rout in years. While analysts say investor hedging is higher than it has been historically, such activity has slowed from the period immediately after the April 2 "Liberation Day", when U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar. Nimble investors moved to hedge against a further dollar decline and the trend was expected to gain momentum. Instead, it has slowed, allowing the U.S. currency to stabilise."The conversations we're having with clients now suggest that these (hedging) flows are less likely to come as imminently as the conversations we had back in May suggested they would," said David Leigh, Nomura's global head of FX and emerging markets. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against other major currencies, has rallied nearly 4 per cent since the end of June, when it was nursing losses of almost 11 per cent after its biggest first-half dive since the early 1970s. Data on hedging is limited and analysts extrapolate from scarce public figures and numbers compiled by banks and custodians. Analysis of client positioning by BNY, one of the world's largest custodians, shows they were very long U.S. assets in early 2025, suggesting they didn't anticipate much additional dollar weakness and were happy to operate without much hedging.That changed in April and hedging is now higher than normal, although lower than in late 2023 when markets began to anticipate Federal Reserve rate cuts."The dollar diversification story this year is more talked about than actioned upon," said Geoff Yu, BNY's senior market strategist. Other giant custodians reported a similar picture. State Street Markets' analysis of the assets State Street has under custody and administration showed that as of end October, foreign equity managers’ hedging of their dollar holdings was 24 per cent, a 4 per centage-point increase since February, but well below the 30 per cent-plus hedge ratio they have seen in the past. They too said it had slowed in recent weeks. It varies by market too. A November National Australia Bank survey of Australian pension funds found "no material change in hedging behaviour towards U.S. equities". Danish central bank data, however, shows hedging by pension funds there has stabilised after increasing post-April. Columbia Threadneedle CIO William Davies said that the firm initially moved to protect its U.S. stock holdings against further dollar weakness but has since unwound some of its hedges, betting the currency won't decline further. NO SNOWBALL EFFECTHedging itself causes currencies to move - adding protection against dollar downside to a previously unhedged position effectively involves selling the greenback, and vice versa. If combined with shifting interest rates, the effect can be dramatic - a dollar selloff can spark more hedging, sending it lower still. "People, earlier this year, were getting excited that this snowball effect would develop, though in the end it didn't really," said HSBC's Paul Mackel, global head of FX research. For next year, "it's something to keep an eye on, but it's not our baseline scenario". Still investor behaviour may be shifting. BlackRock estimates that 38 per cent of flows into Europe, Middle East and Africa-listed U.S. equity exchange-traded products this year have been into those with FX hedges, a meaningful change from 2024 when 98 per cent of flows were unhedged. COST, CORRELATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS Cost is also a factor, and depends on rate differentials and so varies by market. This may help explain some of the reluctance to hedge positions.Japanese investors pay around an annualised 3.7 per cent to hedge against dollar weakness, estimates Van Luu, Russell Investments' global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and FX. This is a sizeable sum - if dollar/yen holds steady for a year, an investor is down 3.7 per cent versus an unhedged peer. The equivalent cost for a euro-funded investor is around 2 per cent."I have a rule of thumb for euro investors, if the cost is around 1 per cent they don't care much, but if it's 2 per cent then it becomes a factor," Luu said. Asset correlations matter too. Traditionally the dollar strengthens when stocks fall, meaning overseas investors are effectively protected on their U.S. positions. That did not happen in April, contributing to the hedging rush. This month, the dollar held steady as stocks tumbled again.Change is also complicated for the many investors who aim to outperform a fixed benchmark if that benchmark is unhedged. Fidelity International recommends Europe-based investors move gradually towards hedging 50 per cent of their dollar exposure, but Salman Ahmed, head of macro and strategic asset allocation, notes it is a "very involved" process which can require governance and benchmark changes.If interest rates move against the dollar and it starts to weaken again, and hedges become cheaper, pressure for change may build. "There's still lots of scope for dollar investments to be hedged, whether that comes to pass and how quickly is an open question," said Nomura's Leigh. "That's what the FX market's trying to get its head around." At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar. Nimble investors moved to hedge against a further dollar decline and the trend was expected to gain momentum. Instead, it has slowed, allowing the U.S. currency to stabilise.

BlackRock estimates that 38 per cent of flows into Europe, Middle East and Africa-listed U.S. equity exchange-traded products this year have been into those with FX hedges, a meaningful change from 2024 when 98 per cent of flows were unhedged. COST, CORRELATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS Cost is also a factor, and depends on rate differentials and so varies by market. This may help explain some of the reluctance to hedge positions. Japanese investors pay around an annualised 3.7 per cent to hedge against dollar weakness, estimates Van Luu, Russell Investments' global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and FX. This is a sizeable sum - if dollar/yen holds steady for a year, an investor is down 3.7 per cent versus an unhedged peer. The equivalent cost for a euro-funded investor is around 2 per cent. "I have a rule of thumb for euro investors, if the cost is around 1 per cent they don't care much, but if it's 2 per cent then it becomes a factor," Luu said. Asset correlations matter too. Traditionally the dollar strengthens when stocks fall, meaning overseas investors are effectively protected on their U.S. positions. That did not happen in April, contributing to the hedging rush. This month, the dollar held steady as stocks tumbled again. Change is also complicated for the many investors who aim to outperform a fixed benchmark if that benchmark is unhedged. Fidelity International recommends Europe-based investors move gradually towards hedging 50 per cent of their dollar exposure, but Salman Ahmed, head of macro and strategic asset allocation, notes it is a "very involved" process which can require governance and benchmark changes. If interest rates move against the dollar and it starts to weaken again, and hedges become cheaper, pressure for change may build. "There's still lots of scope for dollar investments to be hedged, whether that comes to pass and how quickly is an open question," said Nomura's Leigh. "That's what the FX market's trying to get its head around." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Title: BitMine’s Unrealized Losses Hit $3.7B As Ethereum (ETH) Price Struggles Below $3,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A recent report discussed how Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like BitMine and Strategy are sitting on billions of dollars of unrealized profits as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) lose crucial support levels. On Thursday, crypto insights company 10x Research reported that the largest Ethereum Treasury company, BitMine Immersion Technologies, has a multi-billion-dollar paper loss after the ongoing market correction, which has sent ETH to multi-month lows. “Bitmine is now down more than $1,000 per ETH, implying about $3.7 billion in unrealized losses before even accounting for the hefty NAV [net asset value] premium public-market investors paid on top,” the report highlighted. 10x Research believes that treasury companies will struggle to attract new retail investors amid the current market environment, where existing shareholders are sitting on billions of dollars in losses. When NAV rises, “old” shareholders benefit; when it falls, the damage compounds, a dynamic DAT investors often underestimate. When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario. Unlike Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Digital Asset Treasuries “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns,” the report added, noting that many investors are unaware that DATs embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Moreover, 10x Research argued that with the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock, “the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny” as retail investors reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. Despite DAT challenges and ETH’s price action, BitMine has continued to bet on the King of Altcoins. According to Lookonchain data, a new wallet suspected to be linked to the Ethereum-focused treasury company purchased 21,054 ETH, worth around $66.57 million at the time, on Tuesday night. In its November Chairman’s Message, Thomas ‘Tom’ Lee, noted that the crypto market prices have not recovered from the October 10 liquidation event, and “the lingering weakness has the hallmarks of a market maker (or two) suffering from a crippled balance sheet.” BitMine does not believe crypto prices have peaked for this cycle, he added, suggesting that “a crypto cycle top is likely 12-36 months away.” On the contrary, Lee told CNBC News on Monday that the market is “pretty close” to bottoming this week. Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here. Notably, ETH has lost the $3,000 support for the first time since July, retesting the $2,800 area on Thursday morning. However, Lee has affirmed that “Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,840, a 29% decline in the monthly timeframe.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-market-growth-forecast-plume-securitize-2026
Time Published: 2025-11-21T06:22:11Z

Plume says that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, has inked a deal to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. The real-world asset (RWA) market value could more than triple by 2026, as it expands beyond crypto-native use cases and utility, according to Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of RWA-focused layer-2 blockchain Plume. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Yin said that RWA value has taken off in the last year and he expects it to increase by three to five times in 2026, as a base case. “Currently, we are tracking to over 10x the RWA holders number since the start of the year and so we expect us to keep inflecting and we think it’s not crazy to imagine another banner year with 25x+ in user growth numbers,” he said. Over $35 billion in RWA is estimated to be onchain, according to RWA.xyz, across more than 539,000 holders. Yin said the market of tokenized RWAs is entirely serving crypto natives but predicts it will grow exponentially across total value, users, asset classes and utility. “Whereas today the vast majority of RWA value is in US treasury bills, the market maturing and the combination of rate cuts is pushing onchain users to seek higher yields in new places,” he said. Regulations could also play a factor. Many countries, such as the US, are working on legislation governing stablecoins and other tokenized assets. Yin said this will help move them out of the sandbox and into real-life usage soon. “Outside of pure issuance on the supply side, we expect to begin to see the demand side finally come onchain,” Yin added. Plume announced on Wednesday that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, plans to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. Related: Plume Network gains SEC transfer agent status to bring TradFi onchain The Nest staking protocol allows investors to trade and earn yield on tokenized assets. The partnership will connect Securitize’s tokenized funds to Plume’s network of over 280,000 RWA holders, according to Plume. Hamilton Lane funds will be the first, and then other issuers and asset classes from Securitize’s platform will follow in 2026. Plume has 279,692 RWA holders, which makes up around 50% of the total number of holders across all RWA networks. Plume, however, isn’t in the top ten networks according to RWA.xyz. However, Yin explains that Plume has a huge share of users, but each holder may have fewer RWA assets than on other networks. “Plume has 280,000 users holding an aggregate $200 million of RWAs, which is a much healthier measure of usage on a network,” he added.

Nvidia reported $57B in Q3 revenueÂ (62% YoY growth), exceeding Wall Street forecasts. Profits surged toÂ $31.9B, signaling unstoppable AI demand. CEO Jensen Huang declared AI adoption is accelerating globally, with Blackwell GPUs "off the charts" and cloud GPUs "sold out." Nvidia jumped 5% in after-hours trading, nearingÂ $196. Big Tech (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) saw gains. Crypto-linked stocks reboundedÂ (Coinbase, MicroStrategy) as Bitcoin recovered toÂ 91,500 after dipping below 89K. InvestorÂ Michael BurryÂ warned of inflated earnings due to understated data center depreciation. Major players likeÂ Peter Thiel and SoftBank cashed outÂ (SoftBank sold itsÂ $5.8B stake). AI is replacingÂ 80% to 90% of customer service jobsÂ and expanding into creative fields (writing, design). Analysts warn ofÂ job displacement, privacy risks, bias and existential threatsÂ from unchecked AI growth. Nvidia's dominance confirms AI's explosive growth, but sustainability is uncertain. GPU demand remains high, but history showsÂ bubbles eventually burstâinvestors should weigh AI's transformative potential against its disruptive consequences.

Nvidia's dominance confirms AI's explosive growth, but sustainability is uncertain. GPU demand remains high, but history showsÂ bubbles eventually burstâinvestors should weigh AI's transformative potential against its disruptive consequences. Nvidia's record-breaking third-quarter earnings report has sent shockwaves through global markets, fueling a surge in AI and crypto-related stocks while temporarily alleviating fears of an artificial intelligence bubble. The semiconductor giant's staggering performanceâbolstered by unprecedented demand for its AI computing platformsâhas reignited investor optimism, lifting Bitcoin, Big Tech and mining stocks in after-hours trading. Nvidia reportedÂ 57 billion in revenue for Q3, a 62% increase compared to the same period last year and surpasses Wall Street's projections ofÂ 54.7 billion. Profits soared toÂ 31.9 billion, up 65 billion (Â±2%)Â further signaled that AI adoption shows no signs of slowing. CEOÂ Jensen HuangÂ declared, "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out." He emphasized that AI adoption is accelerating globally, stating, "We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fastâwith more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." CFOÂ Colette KressÂ added that Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra architecture is now its leading platform, while older Blackwell models continue to see strong demand. Notably, she downplayed revenue from the China-specificÂ H20 chip, calling it "insignificant"âa nod to U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia's earnings acted as a catalyst for broader market optimism: Nvidia (NVDA)Â surged 5% in after-hours trading, reachingÂ 196 after closing at 186.52. Big TechÂ stocksâApple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)âall posted gains. Crypto-linked equitiesÂ rebounded, with Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) edging higher. Bitcoin mining stocksÂ saw dramatic jumps, led byÂ Cipher Mining (+13%),Â IREN (+10%) andÂ Marathon Digital (+4%), as miners pivot toward AI data center operations. Bitcoin itself clawed back from aÂ 24-hour low of $88,540âits first dip below $89,000 since late AprilâtoÂ 91,500 following Nvidia's report. Ether (ETH) also recovered above 3,000Â after briefly sinking belowÂ $2,900. AI bubble concerns persist Despite the rally, skepticism remains. InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use. Meanwhile, major investors are cashing out: Peter Thiel's hedge fundÂ dumped itsÂ $100 million Nvidia stake. SoftBankÂ sold its entireÂ $5.8 billion positionÂ to fund its own AI ambitions. AI workforce disruption looms While Nvidia's success underscores AI's explosive growth, analysts warn of its societal impact. AI is rapidly displacing human rolesâfrom customer service (handlingÂ 80% to 90% of inquiries) to creative fields like writing and design. As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst. Investors riding the AI wave should tread carefully, recognizing both its transformative potential and disruptive consequences.

As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst.

According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives.

Group’s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, backed Leave campaign Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty UK pub and hotel group JD Wetherspoon – whose founder campaigned for the UK to leave the EU – is using Ireland as a springboard for its expansion into mainland Europe to avoid Brexit-­induced red tape, the Irish Independent has learnt. The stock market-listed group, which owns a small number of pubs in Ireland, has been eyeing locations in Spain for its debut on the Continent. The new ventures will typically be operated on a franchise basis, following the success of franchise partnerships the group has in the UK with universities and a holiday parks firm. The first premises on the Continent is due to open next year. But UK trade with the EU now subject to significant barriers as a result of Brexit. Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty News in 90 Seconds - 21 November 2025 JD Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin was a strong advocate for Brexit, donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. Following the 2016 vote, the UK went on to leave the EU almost six years ago, hitting business between British firms and the trade bloc. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, which operates a total of about 800 pubs, confirmed that the pubs company will now use a newly established subsidiary in Dublin to launch its business in mainland Europe. “Given our current plans for a number of franchise sites in Europe, it is more straightforward if the agreements are between EU-based companies and JD Wetherspoon Europe has been set up [in Dublin] as a result,” he said. JD Wetherspoon opened its first pub in Ireland in 2014, with The Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Later the same year, it opened a premises in Dún Laoghaire. It later opened a handful of pubs in Cork, Carlow and Waterford. However, in 2023 it put those properties, as well as a premises it planned to open in Galway, up for sale. It sold The Three Tun Tavern in 2022. It still operates five pubs in Dublin. Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked After the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU in 2016, Mr Martin hailed the outcome of the referendum as a victory for democracy. “Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked,” he said in an interview with the BBC at the time. Addressing the International Monetary Fund last month, the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said that Brexit has caused long-term damage to the UK’s economy. The UK’s Office for Budgetary Responsibility recently claimed that Brexit will reduce the UK’s productivity by 4pc in the long term. Mr Martin, who was knighted in 2023, said in January this year that JD Wetherspoon is looking at expanding overseas. He cited destinations in Spain such as Alicante, Mallorca and Benidorm that are popular with British holidaymakers as the types of locations that would be suitable for the group. In the year to July 27, 2025, JD Wetherspoon reported revenue of £2.1bn (€2.4bn), a 17pc increase on the previous financial year. Its like-for-like sales rose 5.1pc and it made a pre-tax profit of £81.4m. The group held its annual general meeting yesterday .

Title: Tesla's robotaxi clears a key hurdle in Nevada

Tesla just got one step closer to deploying its robotaxis commercially in Nevada. Tesla completed the self-certification process for the robotaxi in Nevada, a DMV representative told Business Insider. This step means the company can deploy an autonomous car on Nevada roads, but it still needs approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate commercially. A spokesperson for the NTA told Business Insider that Tesla has yet to submit an application for the permit. Clearing self-certification in Nevada comes as CEO Elon Musk aims to expand ride-hailing in up to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year, with a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles. "We expect to be operating in Nevada and Florida and Arizona by the end of the year," Musk said on an October earnings call. Tesla's robotaxis are operating commercially in San Francisco and Austin. The company is hiring in cities such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, and Orlando, as it ramps up the robotaxi deployment process. On Monday, Tesla received approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate ride-hailing services in the state. It also submitted a "self-certification" to test its robotaxis in the state with safety drivers, a spokesperson for the department told Business Insider. Meanwhile, in California, a robotaxi war is breaking out. Uber, Tesla, and Waymo are fighting to shape robotaxi regulations in the state. Waymo, which operates self-driving taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, said in November that companies offering autonomous ride-hailing services should submit quarterly reports about the rides. Tesla opposed this suggestion. This week, Amazon launched its Zoox robotaxi service in San Francisco, offering select members of the public free rides. Tesla's stock price dropped about 2% on Thursday. It's up more than 15% in the past year. Update: November 21, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the NTA. Jump to

Title: 6 hacks to a better government

Antisocial people run in packs. They exert concentrated power, but they are decidedly in the minority. Prosocial people operate individualistically, but in the aggregate, they have much-greater power. Prosocial people can be defeated only by themselves. Many familiar practices don’t utilize power effectively. Some new practices also wouldn’t. Use power effectively these 6 ways: 1. Worship, love, and save. Individual faith in Christ limits the envy that stymies economic growth. Individual faith also strengthens lesser magistrates to limit greater magistrates, which secures individuals’ rights. Love is disciplined action that builds healthy relationships. Saving builds productivity. 2. Choose assets, and consumer products, whose producers do the least harm. Stocks provide the greatest long-term returns of any single class of investment. Choosing stocks in normal times, but choosing gold instead in crisis times, provides even-greater long-term returns. In normal times that include routine government-money-error cycles, stocks provide the greatest returns. In crisis times, when money producers have been more greatly inflating the money quantity, and more greatly suppressing profits, gold shelters assets and provides better returns. Shopping for the best added value is the key ingredient that makes voluntary cooperation select for the producers that add the most value. But this added value can give fund managers and corporate managers the power and control to pursue ends that harm everyone. Individuals can limit such harms by moving their investments out of funds like those of BlackRock and Vanguard, by supporting government officials who limit government pension investments in such funds, and by considering corporate managers’ harmful actions when choosing products like those of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target, and Disney. 3. Assess government people by how fully they use their constitutional powers against others in government and cronies. Government people are delegated powers through their jurisdictions’ charters. Government people’s powers are strikingly asymmetric. Government people have no lawful powers to defy the Constitution but awesome lawful powers and duties to support the Constitution. If government people use their lawful powers to limit only themselves, we need supermajorities before this will secure our freedoms. But if any government person also uses his lawful powers to limit others, then each single executive, bloc of legislators, or judge better secures our freedoms. Many politicians have much to say about what other people should do and are eager to do other people’s jobs, but they don’t do their own jobs. The only things politicians say or do that are worth supporting are actions to use constitutional powers to limit others in government and cronies. 4. Vote strategically for constitutionalists in Republican primaries and in general elections. Keep Republican Progressives from returning in subsequent elections as hard-to-dislodge incumbents. Register as a Republican if needed to vote, and in primaries vote for the most constitutionalist Republicans. In general elections, vote for the most constitutionalist candidates from any party. If you build support, more will follow. If a Progressive Democrat wins for the time being, others in the various branches and jurisdictions have the power and duty to undo any damage he might do. Of these others, Republicans are the only people who might limit Progressive Democrats; and Republican Progressives don’t. Wherever there’s unmitigated damage, Republican Progressives are the people we must hold accountable. 5. Support partial secessions of county regions from legacy state governments and of neighborhood regions from legacy city governments. The Constitution has a rule that the national government shall guarantee to each state ¾ really, to each state’s residents ¾ a republican form of government. A given government can assuredly be republican only if its charter has the same rules and sanctions as the Constitution. In state, county, and city charters, the ratifiers echo the Constitution’s design features but then layer on incompatible scope and administrative states. No state constitutions delegate only limited, enumerated powers. Just as state delegates ratified the Constitution in the USA, county delegates can ratify county-region constitutions within each state, and neighborhood delegates can ratify neighborhood-region constitutions within their cities. Compared to when the USA seceded from Great Britain, this is simpler. Now each region’s delegates can copy the Constitution. Also, now these delegates will be implementing the explicit governing law ¾ the Constitution ¾ whereas the legacy states or cities clearly aren’t. 6. Support a good party. Our fundamental political and therefore economic problem in our system of two major parties is that both are majority Progressive. If the economy is viewed as a process, then governments are impactful controls. If governments are viewed as processes, then parties are the key controls. Where the Constitution is designed to limit governments, party rules are designed to empower party organizations. For a good party, like for a seceding county region or neighborhood region, the Constitution is a model design solution. It’s ready-built and well examined. The fundamental solution is to build at least one major party with a party constitution that limits the party’s power. A good party will use a party constitution and complementary party laws to enact candidate selection processes that favor constitutionalist candidates. We can build a good party any of multiple ways: elect a president who uses his constitutional powers, partially secede from state governments, start neighborhood voter information meetings, take control of the Republican Party. Fail to fix at least one party, and no other solution will be sufficient — Not term limits, not other constitutional amendments. Fix at least one party, and its people will make quick, lasting work of the remaining problems. The more effectively that prosocial individuals use their powers, the more quickly that all people will live in increased freedom.

Antisocial people run in packs. They exert concentrated power, but they are decidedly in the minority. Prosocial people operate individualistically, but in the aggregate, they have much-greater power. Prosocial people can be defeated only by themselves. Many familiar practices don’t utilize power effectively. Some new practices also wouldn’t. Use power effectively these 6 ways: 1. Worship, love, and save. Individual faith in Christ limits the envy that stymies economic growth. Individual faith also strengthens lesser magistrates to limit greater magistrates, which secures individuals’ rights. Love is disciplined action that builds healthy relationships. Saving builds productivity. 2. Choose assets, and consumer products, whose producers do the least harm. Stocks provide the greatest long-term returns of any single class of investment. Choosing stocks in normal times, but choosing gold instead in crisis times, provides even-greater long-term returns. In normal times that include routine government-money-error cycles, stocks provide the greatest returns. In crisis times, when money producers have been more greatly inflating the money quantity, and more greatly suppressing profits, gold shelters assets and provides better returns. Shopping for the best added value is the key ingredient that makes voluntary cooperation select for the producers that add the most value. But this added value can give fund managers and corporate managers the power and control to pursue ends that harm everyone. Individuals can limit such harms by moving their investments out of funds like those of BlackRock and Vanguard, by supporting government officials who limit government pension investments in such funds, and by considering corporate managers’ harmful actions when choosing products like those of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target, and Disney. 3.

Title: Jeff Bezos-backed Physical Intelligence raises $600M to improve its AI robot brains
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/20/jeff-bezos-backed-physical-intelligence-raises-600m-improve-ai-robot-brains/
Time Published: 2025-11-21T02:00:56Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 21:00 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2025 by Mike Wheatley Robotics software startup Physical Intelligence has reportedly closed on a fresh, $600 million round of funding that brings its valuation to a lofty $5.6 billion. The company has not officially disclosed the latest round, but reports by The Information and Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources who are familiar with the matter on the details. Those sources said CapitalG, an independent growth fund operated by Alphabet Inc., led the round, with existing investors Lux Capital, Thrive Capital and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos all returning to throw more capital at the startup. New investors Index Ventures and T. Rowe Price also participated in the round, the sources said. The startup was founded in 2024 by former Google DeepMind researchers and academics from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. It’s developing artificial intelligence algorithms that can act as the “brains” of robots. The company, which is led by Chief Executive Karol Hausman, says it’s building a “general intelligence” system that will eventually be able to power any kind of robot for any kind of application. Robotics AI is a completely different kettle of fish from AI for chatbots such as ChatGPT. Because robots operate in the real world, they need to be able to learn not only from text, but also from other modalities, especially visual data, so they can perceive the physical environment they operate in and make decisions and take actions based on those inputs. Physical Intelligence has not yet announced any product or service, but Bloomberg said the company has been testing its AI software on robotic arms, performing tasks such as folding clothes, assembling boxes and making coffee. Earlier this week, the company released a new vision AI model based on reinforcement learning – a technique that enables models to improve over time as they learn from their experiences. The startup has shared a video of its robotic arms in action on X, saying that the reinforcement learning technique has helped it to double its overall throughput, or the number of tasks it can complete per hour. Our model can now learn from its own experience with RL! Our new π*0.6 model can more than double throughput over a base model trained without RL, and can perform real-world tasks: making espresso drinks, folding diverse laundry, and assembling boxes. More in the thread below. pic.twitter.com/XN1VFYQey1 — Physical Intelligence (@physical_int) November 18, 2025 In testing, Physical Intelligence said the machines were put to work for three hours, and were able to complete each task in an average of three minutes. To develop its models, the startup has spent a lot of money on gathering real-world data that’s used for training purposes. A year ago, when it raised $400 million in funding, the company said one of the biggest challenges it faces is getting enough large-scale multitask and multirobot data to train its models, and its experiments allow it to generate valuable data itself. The startup says existing robots tend to be inflexible, because they’re designed to perform only one particular task in a specific environment. They can work around small changes in their environments but can’t adapt easily to extremely messy or complex spaces such as homes or other real-world places. Physical Intelligence’s goal is to change that, using general intelligence to enable robots to learn and become acclimatized to any environment and task. The startup is not alone in thinking that AI can be used to create much more capable robots. Google LLC is also focused on robotic intelligence through its subsidiary Intrinsic, which just yesterday announced its partnering with Foxconn on a smart factory initiative. Meta Platforms Inc. is also developing AI for robots, and this week announced its latest Segment Anything computer vision models. Amazon has similar ambitions, and regularly introduces more sophisticated, AI-enabled robots in its logistics and warehouse facilities. Similarly, there are dozens of startups that compete with Physical Intelligence, with the likes of Gecko Robotics Inc., Genesis AI, Cobionix Corp. and FieldAI Inc. some of the latest to attract investment capital in recent months.

iRunFar reviews the best GPS watches for running from Garmin, Coros, Suunto, Amazfit, Apple, and Polar. A GPS watch can track various metrics before, during, and after your run and help you maximize your workouts. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi If you’re looking into options for the best GPS running watch and feeling overwhelmed by the options and their price tags, you’re not alone. As runners, many of us are deeply committed to the sport, and some of us have a thirst for our personal data rivaling the overlords at Meta. Then, others of us want a simple watch to keep track of time and maybe measure our heart rate. And then some runners choose to go with no technology at all. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, our testing of various GPS watches on the market will help you choose the best one for your needs and budget. When testing watches, our team looked at battery life, screen size, features, and durability. This guide builds on years of testing, comparing the latest watches to their predecessors and identifying what stands out. Our team of runners of all types analyzed which watches worked best for different situations, runner needs, and budgets. We continually update this guide as new models of watches hit the market. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is our favorite for its features, appearance, and price. If you’re looking for lower-priced options, we recommend the Suunto Run or the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro, as they provide a lot of features at a very reasonable price.. To learn more about the lingo associated with GPS watches, how we came up with our list of favorites, and things to consider when choosing yours, look at the how-to-choose section, frequently asked questions, and research and testing methodology below our picks. A GPS watch can let you track your data and splits throughout a run. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Pros: Cons: While Garmin has an array of watches ranging from those with every feature imaginable to reasonably basic, the Garmin Forerunner 570 is the most complete mid-premium device designed for runners that the brand has released. Five years ago, when I began testing GPS running watches in earnest, I was what you might call a “bigger is better” person — always reaching for the largest, most spec-heavy device available for trail running. I leaned heavily on Garmin’s fēnix and Enduro lines, including the Garmin fēnix 7 Solar Edition and the Garmin fēnix 8 AMOLED. I still respect how capable those adventure watches are, but over time, my priorities shifted. I’ve come to appreciate smaller, more running-focused designs with cleaner interfaces, less gimmickry — think solar-powered glass — and far more reasonable price tags. A thousand-dollar adventure watch just isn’t what most runners actually need. But one thing hasn’t changed, though: I still think Garmin makes the best all-around GPS running watch. Competing offerings from Coros, Suunto, and Amazfit are improving every year, but Garmin continues to dominate when it comes to accuracy, training depth, and ecosystem strength. The Forerunner 570 feels like the true sweet spot — bringing the precision and intelligence of Garmin’s fēnix and Epix lines to a lighter, more comfortable watch focused squarely on all runners. The 570 is lightweight and easy to wear all day, and it has an upgraded AMOLED display that’s bright without being overdone. It’s readable in intense sun, under dense tree cover, and at night without glare or blown-out contrast. Garmin’s classic five-button interface is still a huge advantage, especially while wearing gloves or trying to operate the watch while running on uneven surfaces. Weighing 50 grams, it’s a watch you forget you’re wearing. The 570 separates itself in GPS accuracy and trail performance. Garmin’s multi-band and multi-GNSS chipset now appears in this mid-tier model, offering the kind of precision you once had to buy a fēnix to get. Road pacing stays remarkably stable, even during surges or structured intervals. On the trail, the watch handles canyons, tree cover, switchbacks, and altitude shifts with impressive consistency. Satellite lock is near-instant, and track quality remains clean and believable even in environments that confuse cheaper sensors. Battery life continues the “just right” approach. You get 18 hours in all-systems GNSS and multi-band GPS mode, and about 11 days of use in smartwatch mode — enough for marathons, 50k races, and long training weeks without constant charging. Garmin’s training ecosystem remains unmatched, and the auto-climb feature stands out for trail runners, breaking climbs into segments so you can pace strategically. Navigation is another major strength, with offline maps, turn-by-turn routing, and seamless compatibility with Garmin Connect and Strava. The 570 isn’t flawless. Before a September race, I loaded my PacePro plan only for the watch to freeze at the starting line and becoming useless until it auto-restarted twenty minutes later, costing me several recorded miles. And offline Spotify integration, one of my must-have Garmin features, still suffers occasional playback interruptions. These frustrations stand out because the rest of the watch works so seamlessly. The Forerunner 570 balances elite accuracy, powerful training tools, excellent navigation, and comfort better than any other watch I’ve tested this year. It’s the most complete GPS running watch of 2025 — and the clear top pick. Pros: Cons: At its core, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 remains a productivity smartwatch designed for endurance athletes who want rugged hardware, deep health tracking, and outstanding GPS performance. The new Ultra 3 isn’t a radical departure from the Apple Watch Ultra 2, but a few key upgrades improve its functionality. Compared to the Ultra 2, this model offers longer battery life, a faster S10 processor, more storage, a larger and more efficient display, and, most excitedly for ultrarunners and backcountry athletes, emergency satellite connectivity. When off-grid, this watch can reach satellites to send messages, share your location, and communicate with emergency services — and it can do this all without your phone. While we haven’t had a chance to test this feature on this specific watch, we’ve been impressed with the reliability of the satellite communications of iPhones with similar technology. For trail runners, hikers, and anyone who ventures into remote terrain, this is a meaningful safety upgrade. The watch keeps the safety features of the previous version, like crash detection, fall detection, and an 86-decibel siren. Battery life is a tangible improvement this year. Apple claims up to 42 hours of regular use, 72 hours in low-power mode, and up to 14 hours of continuous GPS tracking with heart rate monitoring. If you need a longer tracking time, you can put the watch in low power mode where it makes fewer GPS and heart rate readings, and the battery will last up to 35 hours. The watch’s charging is faster now too, and runners can expect an 80% charge in about 45 minutes. For the display, a new OLED panel with a thinner bezel makes room for a slightly larger screen. The always-on mode now updates every second, which makes watch faces and data fields easier to read during a run. As before, brightness is excellent, and the touchscreen is quick and responsive — though still not ideal with wet hands or gloves. Some familiar drawbacks remain with the Apple Watch Ultra 3. You still need an Apple device to activate it, mapping and routing still lag behind dedicated sports watches, you can’t natively upload a route to follow during a workout, and the compass workaround requires manual juggling between apps. But as an all-in-one device, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is outstanding. Running with only this watch and earbuds — with music, calls, messages, and safety features fully onboard — remains one of its biggest strengths. If you’re upgrading from a non-Ultra Apple Watch, the leap is a big one. For Ultra 2 owners, the decision to upgrade comes down to how much you value the better battery, larger display, and satellite safety features. Overall, this is the most capable Ultra watch yet — a rugged and connected device that can handle daily training and save your bacon in the backcountry without carrying an auxiliary device like a Garmin InReach. Pros: Cons: The Coros Apex 4 combines running-specific performance features with the ruggedness needed for mountain-sport athletes. In Coros’s athlete matrix, it’s not the Eliud Kipchoge or the Tommy Caldwell — it’s the Kilian Jornet: a blended runner, climber, and skier who goes long or short in a variety of environments. It showcases Coros’s most up-to-date technology — voice alerts, calls, voice pins, improved sensors, and more — wrapped in one distinctly low-tech choice by 2025 standards: a MIP display. In fact, it’s only one of two watches in this entire guide without an AMOLED display, and while that’s a matter of visual preference, the low-tech display’s impact on battery life is undeniably an advantage. The watch sits in the mid-tier price bracket and is competitive with its peers in some ways, and behind in others. That said, it’s also the strongest updates we’ve seen this year, bringing Coros’s newest features into a watch that’s far more usable for runners than the company’s newest outdoor flagship device, the Nomad. Having fully crossed over into the AMOLED era, I was legitimately shocked by the MIP display. Nearly every watch I’ve tested in the past two years has arrived with a bright, phone-like AMOLED panel. I was so surprised by the Apex 4’s dimness that I texted iRunFar founder and Gear Editor Bryon Powell to confirm whether it was just me. Bryon, not an AMOLED acolyte, finds the display perfectly suitable. It’s worth noting that the Apex 4 has no brightness adjustment, though runners can toggle a white background for slight improvement. The Apex 4 uses super-strong sapphire glass for exceptional durability and scratch-resistance, and is the same glass used on Coros’s highest-end mountain watches. Coros also adds the Action Button on the lower left side of the case that gives quick access to frequently used features — including your maps, saved pins, and any shortcuts you configure. For runners and mountain athletes who prefer tactile control over touchscreen swipes, the new button is a meaningful usability upgrade that makes mid-run navigation or note-taking dramatically more efficient. If maximizing battery is a priority, the Apex 4 is a better bet than Coros’s AMOLED models and offers 41 hours of GPS use. Satellite lock is near-instant, cornering is accurate, and elevation data is stable. In road, foothill, and track testing, it performed on par with the Coros Pace Pro and significantly better than older Apex models. It’s not quite to the level of Suunto Vertical 2 in extreme terrain, but everywhere else, it’s excellent. The Apex 4 debuts Coros’s most ambitious voice-tech package to date, and it’s genuinely useful. Voice alerts read out splits, laps, and heart rate zone changes clearly enough that you rarely need to look at the screen. You can answer calls via Bluetooth and dictate short voice pins mid-run, which sync to the app automatically. For trail runners who want to capture route notes, conditions, or nutrition reminders, voice pins are one of Coros’s best new features. The Apex 4 also brings Coros’s best mapping experience yet. Scrolling is fluid, labels are clearer than on any previous Apex, and map detail has been meaningfully upgraded. While AMOLED watches will always look sharper, the MIP maps remain surprisingly readable and deliver far superior battery endurance during navigation-heavy outings. The Apex 4 is Coros’s most complete iteration in this series. If you prioritize battery life, reliable GPS, excellent mapping, rugged durability, handy hardware controls, and surprisingly effective voice tech over a pretty screen, it’s one of the best performing watches of 2025. Pros: Cons: The Coros Vertix 2S is an upgrade on the previous watch in this category, the Coros Vertix 2. With improved GPS accuracy and the newest optical heart rate monitor, this watch’s updates are relatively minor. That said, we loved the last version, and this watch keeps everything we appreciated about its predecessor. We acknowledge that this probably isn’t a pure runner’s watch, but people who go on long adventures will use and appreciate the many features. The new upgrades actually decrease the battery life of this watch. Still, it has 118 hours of battery in standard GPS mode — nine hours less than the previous model. Much of the decrease comes from the new optical heart rate monitor sensor. The watch uses an algorithm to account for your running cadence to edit out the extraneous noise that often affects wrist heart rate measurements. We’ve always found this line of Coros watches to be the most accurate when navigating terrain without a clear view of the sky, like slot canyons in Utah. Compared to watches from other brands, its pings seemed to jump around far less. The body of this watch features sapphire glass and a titanium bezel, making it extremely rugged. It makes it less-than-ideal for casual wear for most people, but you can trust it to stand up to the rigors of the mountains. The 1.4-inch screen is larger than most others on the market and will dwarf smaller wrists, and some of our testers had a hard time fitting it through the wrist holes of shirts they were wearing. The large face does provide plenty of space to see up to eight data fields at once, and it makes navigation a little easier on the eyes. If you don’t like to charge your watch often or want one to accompany you on long adventure runs, fastpacks, or other multi-day expeditions, the battery life and features of the Coros Vertix 2S can’t be beaten. You can read more about the details of this watch in our in-depth Coros Vertix 2S review. Pros: Cons: One of the bigger surprises in the GPS watch market this year has been the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro. The watch offers the capabilities of a Garmin fēnix at a far more accessible price. With competitive battery life, one of the most stunning displays on any watch I’ve tested, and deep biometric analytics, the brand makes a compelling case as the best value in performance wearables right now. What immediately stands out is the 1.5-inch AMOLED display. It’s the brightest and most vivid screen we’ve tested, with contrast and sharpness that make traditional MIPS displays feel muted by comparison. If you’re coming from a Garmin fēnix, Coros Apex or Vertix, or any non-AMOLED device, one glance at the T-Rex 3 Pro is like a jolt of espresso — colors pop, maps are actually enjoyable to navigate, and data fields are legible at every angle. Amazfit has spent the past few years quietly reinventing itself from a budget-friendly alternative into a legitimate challenger to the legacy GPS brands. The design is bold and armored, albeit a tad chintzy — kind of like a generic PC next to a cutting-edge looking Apple — but it’s much more refined than previous generations. Amazfit uses sapphire glass on this rugged trail model, and durability appears excellent so far. I haven’t crash-tested it with a full trail wipeout, but after several scrapes against granite and sandstone, the lens remains completely scratch-free. Under open skies, accuracy is strong, pacing is stable, and satellite lock is quick. On dense, winding trails, the watch still performs well overall, though it doesn’t quite match Garmin’s top chipsets. Occasional micro-wobbles happen in tough conditions, but they’re rare. What stands out most is the responsiveness — pace changes register quickly without smoothing or lag, a feature that has historically held back value-tier watches. Battery life remains one of Amazfit’s defining advantages, with up to 38 hours of dual-band GPS use. With dual-band GPS and always-on display active, the T-Rex 3 Pro still lasts multiple training days before needing a charge. With settings optimized, stretching it beyond a week is easy. Amazfit’s health and training ecosystem — built on parent company Zepp’s operating system — continues to mature. Stress scores, sleep tracking, recovery metrics, and training load estimates are all here. Garmin still leads in coaching and long-term analytics, but the Zepp app presents data in a clean and intuitive manner, and the overall experience is smooth. Navigation features include turn-by-turn guidance, offline maps, and reliable syncing with popular route platforms. Smartwatch features like notifications, weather, music control, and a growing Zepp OS app library round out the package and make the watch feel far more premium than its price. The T-Rex 3 Pro represents the most polished version of Amazfit’s identity: bold, durable, extraordinarily bright, and packed with functionality. It doesn’t quite match Garmin’s ecosystem depth, but no other brand delivers this level of performance, ruggedness, and battery life for the price. Pros: Cons: Suunto has long been known for its rugged, mountain-ready — and sometimes comically bulky looking on normal or small wrists — multisport watches, and the Suunto Run takes a refreshing U-turn toward almost extreme minimalism. If you have used a Suunto in the past, taking the Run out of the box will have you double-checking your assumptions, and actually wearing the Run — with its super-comfortable, soft nylon strap — will reveal its key advantage. At only 36 grams with the textile ban, it is easily the lightest watch in this buyer’s guide, though the new Coros Pace 4 takes the lightest title this year at 32 grams. As for performance, it also ramps up processing power and has a decreased lag time while in an activity and scrolling through data pages. The AMOLED display is brilliantly bright and very easy to read, with large digits and uncluttered data fields that make quick glances simple. The interface is intuitive, and menus are structured logically enough to learn the watch in minutes. It truly prioritizes activity — not bells and whistles — so much so that you can navigate to start a run in just one click. Build quality is far better than expected at this price, with a sturdy polymer case, stainless steel bezel, Gorilla glass, and strong water and impact resistance. GPS accuracy is one of the watch’s strongest attributes. Suunto’s heritage in navigation shows even in this entry-level model. The watch has a dual-band multi-GNSS chipset — awesome for a watch at this price point — allowing it to lock onto the best available satellites for optimal accuracy. Post-run syncing and processing speed are historically two of Suunto’s biggest pain points. Both are improved but still the slowest among the watches in this guide. Compared to other watches in this guide, the Suunto Run’s battery life is just average. You can expect about 20 hours of GPS runtime in the highest-accuracy dual-band satellite mode with bio-monitoring and brightness features on high, and you’ll get upward of 40 hours with the power-saving GPS mode enabled. Training features focus on essentials rather than advanced analytics. A reliable optical heart-rate sensor, basic recovery indicators, structured interval support, and suggested workouts give new runners everything they need to build fitness safely. Pace, distance, cadence, and effort metrics sync seamlessly to platforms like the Suunto app, Strava, and TrainingPeaks. The Suunto Run nails exactly what beginners need: accuracy, durability, simplicity, and value. It feels intentionally designed to remove friction, reduce distractions, and give new runners a trustworthy, confidence-building tool. For anyone buying their first GPS device or returning to running with a desire for clarity and ease, this is the most compelling entry-level option. Pros: Cons: At around $600 (stainless steel) and $700 (titanium), the Suunto Vertical 2 brings the brand’s strongest hardware to date, with their latest chipsets, sensors, and processing power. GPS accuracy is exceptional, and the new heart-rate sensor finally produces readings that rival your old chest strap. There’s plenty of onboard storage for free worldwide maps — though downloading a state-sized region like Colorado still takes close to an hour over Wi-Fi. Battery life is outstanding, providing nearly 60 hours of continuous, full-accuracy GPS on a single charge, and over 200 hours in the deepest power-saving modes. Design is where the Vertical 2 truly separates itself. Suunto continues to favor clean geometry, symmetry, and subtle material transitions. Suunto has unveiled a raft of new watches over the last few years, expanding their options to meet runners and outdoor athletes with new price points and features that better match a wide variety of needs. With all its new watches, Suunto has retained its Scandinavian design aesthetic, which, to me, still presents the most premium, cleanest, and aesthetically pleasing GPS watches on the market. A major part of Suunto’s design aesthetic now centers around the AMOLED display. Suunto has rolled out the display across its entire running and outdoor line and has even said it likely won’t produce another MIP device again. That’s great news for fans of crystal-clear brightness and HD-quality mapping, though a concern if you prefer the softer, less power-hungry feel of MIP screens. Still, on a 1.5-inch display — the largest in this guide — AMOLED looks outstanding. And since the Vertical 2 no longer uses the solar energy-collecting glass found on the first Vertical, Suunto reclaimed even more space for visibility and mapping detail on the front panel. Despite its substantial size, the Vertical 2 sits flatter and more naturally on the wrist than earlier Suunto giants thanks to tapered walls and angles. The thick silicone strap remains one of the best in the industry: soft, slightly stretchy, and secure. It’s comfortable enough to be positioned on the wrist where the heart rate sensor sits best. The three widely spaced metal buttons maintain Suunto’s minimalist ethos and provide a firm, glove-friendly click. Suunto has added a feature that seems small but becomes indispensable once you use it: a very bright front-of-unit flashlight — as opposed to the backlight-based flashlight on the Suunto Race series. With multiple brightness settings, it’s remarkable for navigating camp or just making it to the bathroom in the middle of the night without your phone. As you might expect, this is a watch that harkens back to Suunto’s past: a huge display, a thick, ultra-comfortable strap, and a bomb-proof bezel. But it pairs that classic ruggedness with modern components, one of the best displays in the category, and a level of industrial design that remains unique to Suunto. Shop the Suunto Vertical 2 - stainless steelShop the Vertical 2 - titanium Pros: Cons: Coming from a brand that used to dominate fitness devices 15 years ago, the Polar Grit X2 is a return to the competitive end of the market for the company. Polar has existed as a fitness device brand for over 50 years, but seemed to lose its footing around the 2010s when you couldn’t line up to a running, cycling, or other endurance activity or race without seeing a Polar heart rate chest strap, cadence monitor, bike computer, or wrist watch attached to nearly every athlete in the field. Since then, Polar has been flat-out eclipsed by a core set of running watch brands that have been faster to react, market, and innovate for modern customers. Despite getting overtaken by Coros, Garmin, Suunto, and even Apple, Polar has quietly produced some excellent devices over the past couple of years with competitive features and a software ecosystem that could be described as quirky — in a good way! The Grit X2 took a long time to make it to the United States market after becoming available in Europe early in the year. The scuttlebutt suggests that some tenuous trade agreements could be behind the delay, as well as the cost. At $800 the Grit X2 is very expensive, though it is the “affordable” option behind its even more expensive sibling, the Grit X2 Pro, which comes in at $1,000. The X2 is a tad lighter, smaller, and slower compared to the Grit X2 Pro, but it has the same gorgeous AMOLED display and a highly adequate battery life of around 30 hours in its best performance mode. The Grit X2 — like the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Apex 4 — is a capable running watch that also plays well in other mountain sports settings. The watch’s Scandinavian design is similar in some ways to Suunto’s balance of rugged but not bulky. It has a 1.28-inch display protected by sapphire glass, and it has proven to be extremely easy to read in bright sunlight and has withstood a couple big diggers. Despite all this toughness, it remains wearable for everyday use, and the tactile buttons are optimized for gloved hands, making it truly a watch that can handle city streets, mountain summits, and everything in between. In short, the Polar Grit X2 is a well-rounded, highly capable watch that deserves more attention from outdoor athletes and runners alike. It proves that Polar can still compete with the biggest names in the industry. While it may not have dominated headlines like Garmin or Apple over the past decade, the Grit X2 quietly delivers on all fronts: accurate dual-band GPS chipset, advanced biosensing, robust navigation, and rugged durability. The Coros Vertix 2S offers a wide range of features and great battery life but is too big for casual wear for many.

Photo: iRunFar/Christin Randall Accuracy What we fundamentally want from the best GPS watch for running is to correctly measure a run’s distance, pace, and elevation change. Thanks to incredible innovation in satellite technology and specific algorithms designed for sports by watch manufacturers, we now have incredibly complex technology in a package small enough for your wrist. Even relatively inexpensive watches like the Suunto Run have exceptional GPS accuracy. When it comes to accuracy, we’re often perplexed when, after trail running with a friend, we compare distance and vertical gain and see different results. This is sometimes a function of different brands’ technology, but it is often a function of battery power-saving modes, the number of GPS readings per minute you’ve selected, or the default settings on your watch. Utilizing the maximum location measurement frequency will sap a watch battery, but while spacing out the readings is easier on the battery, it creates a less precise track. Obstructions in the sky, like trees or even clouds, can affect GPS accuracy, and the industry suggests GPS accuracy is within 1% to 3%. Manufacturers recommend importing your data to a run-specific app, like Garmin Connect or the Suunto App, to corroborate your data with more sophisticated elevation models. We found that the most accurate GPS watch we tested was the Coros Vertix 2S, especially in areas where we didn’t have a clear view of the sky. Battery Life Battery life is arguably the most prized feature for ultrarunners looking for the best GPS watch. Fortunately, we are in something of a battery life golden age. Every major GPS watch company seeks to one-up their competitor to own the title of longest-lasting battery. This competition benefits the customer, as we’re not only getting batteries that can last up to 118 hours of normal GPS use, as with the Coros Vertix 2S, but they also charge incredibly fast. When just a few years ago, companies would boast about 15 to 20 hours of battery life, and their watches might take three to five hours to charge from dead, we’re getting massive increases in battery life and equally as big drops in charging time. The Suunto Vertical 2 can go from dead to fully charged in under an hour and will then measure over 60 hours of activity. Companies’ claims about battery life represent use with standard GPS tracking alone, without the additional battery demands of using navigation, receiving notifications, or playing music. Rather than manually tuning your watch to the best or worst battery performance, many manufacturers have preset battery modes that allow you to select the performance level you require based on your activity or the remaining battery power on the watch. Suunto watches are known for their sleek, Scandinavian designs. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Comfort Years ago, GPS watches looked like tiny computers on your wrist, and some, like the Suunto Vertical 2, are continuing to lean into the rugged and large aesthetic. As time passes, GPS watch sizes are getting more compact, and breakthroughs in technical performance are shrinking the package while adding new features. Many brands offer different strap styles in addition to the normal silicone one, including nylon and other soft-style straps with elastic and hook-and-loop closures. These styles can add comfort and a more precise fit. The best example of this is the band included with the Suunto Run — it’s so light and comfortable you might forget you’re wearing it. All the watches in this guide are comfortable enough to wear all day, but the appropriateness of wearing a GPS watch to work or other life commitments varies depending on the user. Watches like the Suunto Run or the Polar Grit X2 are small and stylish enough to wear in everyday life, while many people would shy away from wearing the Suunto Vertical 2 or similar rugged-looking watches in casual settings. Ease of Use The incredible technology in the best GPS running watches means there can be a learning curve to taking advantage of their full functionality. Not a single watch here is simple enough to pull out of the box and use all of the features immediately. You might be able to record a run — but what next? Do you use the watch’s corresponding app to synchronize it? Do you make adjustments in the watch itself or with the app? Is it a combination of both? These are questions you’ll need to sort out as you begin accessing features on your watch and learning its capabilities. The Suunto Run is one of the simplest watches to learn to use. With so many options and the amount of data provided, it even takes time to remember which buttons control selections and navigate forward or back. Some watches have a bold start/stop button distinct from the others. The watches in this guide use buttons, scrolling dials, touchscreens, or a combination of all three to operate. Buttons are simple to use on the fly, but dials, like on the Coros Apex 4, can be tricky to use quickly. Buttons are generally big and responsive, with some performing much better than others. The watches in this guide with touchscreens generally work well even in wet or cold conditions. Extra Features and App Compatibility Each watch in this guide has a corresponding mobile app that can do everything from downloading your runs and sharing with a third-party app like Strava to designing and synchronizing routes. The apps can also control the colors and display of the watch face and synchronize firmware. Many watches have a coaching component that allows you to customize your workout or download workouts directly from professional athletes. The Polar Grit X2 has a suite of features, including hydration tracking and menstrual cycle tracking. Several watches in this guide can sync offline playlists from streaming services like Spotify, or have built-in storage for music playback. Some watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Garmin Forerunner 570, have Mobile Pay. iRunFar’s Meghan Hicks tests the Coros Vertix 2 in the slot canyons of Utah. We found it to provide more accurate GPS tracking than other watches in areas like slot canyons. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi We at iRunFar are GPS running watch aficionados with a long history of testing watches. Many of our team members love pouring over running data, and we use our watches to collect accurate metrics of our runs and health. For the initial version of this guide, we combined our more than 100 years of GPS running watch field testing with polls of the iRunFar community to see what everyone thought was the best GPS running watch on the market. We selected nearly a dozen highly vetted watches for rigorous summer, fall, winter, and spring testing. We tested these watches in climates from the densely forested northwestern United States to the cold, dry, and variable seasons of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. We took different GPS watches out in difficult terrain, like slot canyons in Utah and mountains in Bhutan, to see if there was a difference in accuracy in places where they didn’t get a clear view of the sky. We evaluated the watches based on their features, price, comfort, processing speed, accuracy, navigation capabilities, battery life, and compatibility with third-party apps. We continue to test new watches and update this guide when needed. What is a GPS watch, and why is it helpful in trail running and ultrarunning? Besides shorts and shoes, many runners consider a GPS watch a fundamental piece of running gear. It lets you easily and accurately record your runs and see important data. like pace and elevation gain, while you’re out there. The data synchronizes with popular apps, allowing you to compare or log your information securely. It’s a training log that doesn’t take up physical space. Moreover, the watches in this guide work for more than just running. They track tons of other sports, such as paddleboarding, yoga, and cycling, and collect the unique metrics associated with each activity. Every watch in this guide can significantly improve your understanding of your body and training. The Garmin Forerunner 570 combines a lot of useful features for a reasonably competitive price. This is not to suggest that trail or ultrarunning requires a GPS watch. For many, the invasion of more and more data in our lives is becoming burdensome and tiring. A pen-and-paper training journal combined with a simple stopwatch or using your smartphone with any number of free run-recording apps is much more inexpensive and simple. The Suunto Race has a variety of activity options besides running. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which running watch has the best GPS? Each watch tested in this guide does a fine job of tracking your run. Positioning in these watches is usually acquired through one or a combination of the five major satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and Beidou). Different satellite systems have variable accuracy in different areas of the world. Incremental differences appear between all of the watches, even on the same activity, yet none of the watches tested here has an outlying poor output. The Coros Vertix 2S has a feature that seeks to combat satellite interference, whether it’s from a dense forest or a deep canyon, by utilizing all five satellite systems at once. Choosing the best GPS watch could almost be more a matter of what else it has beyond good GPS accuracy, since there isn’t a poor performer among the bunch in this guide. Apple watches can provide the same tracking and health metrics of top GPS watches. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi I want to race my first ultramarathon. Which GPS running watch should I use? Many people will simply use their phone and the app like Strava for their first ultra. This is a low-cost and simple way to use a piece of hardware you already own and are probably going to carry regardless. The drawback is that your phone has a battery that probably won’t last beyond 50k. If you’re new to ultrarunning and simply looking for the best GPS running watch for reliability and affordability, the Suunto Run and Garmin Forerunner 570 are excellent and affordable options. You won’t get all the fancy features of the highest-end watches, but you’ll get enough battery to last nearly any ultra. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro also packs in a lot of features at a reasonable price point. For ultrarunners who want to get the most technology, data, and performance out of their races and training, this guide has some truly exceptional options, namely the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Vertix 2S. What’s the difference between a fitness tracker and a running watch? This is a question mainly regarding features. Fitness trackers have come a long way and are more affordable than any watches tested in this guide. But their downside is that they rely heavily on pairing with a phone to draw out similar features that are built directly into GPS watches. The health and sleep monitoring features of the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro and the Polar Grit X2 can give you much of the information that dedicated fitness trackers provide. From intervals to health metrics, GPS watches can measure and track all of your data. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which is the most accurate GPS watch? When comparing all of the watches tested here on the same 25-kilometer run, not a single one had exact fidelity when comparing the GPX track to the trail marked on Mapbox, the commercial map provider for everything from Strava to the navigation system in your car. In some cases, the track showed a tester crossing an alpine lake, which they didn’t, or taking a very long detour around part of a forest. You might expect the same brand of watches to provide the same output, but that wasn’t the case. There were deviations between watches across the board. We found that the advanced GPS system of the Coros Vertix 2S outperformed other watches when it came to difficult conditions, such as in slot canyons or under heavy tree cover. Two of our testers who run together frequently find that a Coros watch consistently measures more distance when compared to a Garmin, but the Garmin reports more elevation gain. The consistency of the variability points toward differences in the algorithms used by the watches to calculate these numbers. The industry says that most GPS watches are accurate within 1% to 3%, which explains the deviation in watches, even when tested simultaneously. A few watches have special features to improve their accuracy. Suunto employs its “Snap to Route,” where you could take a GPX file, load it into the watch, and then navigate that course while you run. This is a clever way to ensure that your run is as faithful to the intended route as possible, and it minimizes error due to satellite reception and other variables, like clouds, buildings, or other obstructions. We asked the Garmin product manager to explain the differences between measurements of different watches on the same course. They said, “There are numerous challenges in forming an elevation profile over a long trail run or ultramarathon, like effects of weather over longer periods and how the watch is worn (for example, if the barometer port is up against clothing).” They continued, “Because of these sources of error, we expect differences in the total ascent between runners, and these can add up over long-distance runs. On the distance side, GPS accuracy is the biggest thing. User settings, type of device, which arm the user is wearing the watch, running form, and environment (tree cover can affect the line of sight to satellites) can all affect accuracy.” The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music is a great entry-level GPS watch that is simple to navigate and use. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi These watches are so expensive! What is the best budget running watch? You’ll have to spend some money to get a reasonable GPS watch, though there are major variations in the price points among the different options. Chiefly, the ever-mind-blowing strength of their batteries that dictate the cost, plus a suite of other features that help you understand your physiology, including heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. A GPS watch can replace your phone as a podcast or music device, and they are incredibly durable with their titanium, steel, and sapphire materials. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro offers many of the features of a high-end watch at a much lower price. What’s the best running watch for small wrists? Many GPS watches, like the Coros Vertix 2S, have big displays that look massive on even average-sized wrists. The large size makes it easier to see a lot of data and to navigate with offline maps. The Suunto Run, with a much sleeker design, won’t swallow smaller wrists. These two are at opposite ends of the price spectrum, separated by about $400. In the end, the best GPS running watch for you will be one that you’re comfortable wearing, so it’s worth considering fit when choosing one. Both road and trail runners can benefit from the data collected by a GPS watch. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi What GPS running watch best integrates with smart technology so that I can stay connected while running? All the watches in this guide — including the least expensive Suunto Run — display notifications from incoming calls, text messages, and emails on their screens. You must connect the watch to your smartphone via Bluetooth for this to work. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is essentially a phone on your wrist. I am bad with technology. What running watch is the easiest to use? If ultrarunning is your primary sport, many of these GPS watches are overbuilt for what you actually need in terms of features. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is one of the more pared-down of these options, but it still has all of the features a runner needs. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also an excellent option for those who struggle with technology. Like most Apple products, it provides a great user experience, and the dedicated action button makes it easy to put it on your wrist and go. It will still interpret your daily data, including sleep, and can guide you in improving your fitness and health. Related articles: Craig Randall is a Gear Editor and Buyer’s Guide Writer at iRunFar.

Bitcoin traded in the red for eight consecutive days amid intense selling pressure from holders. Aggressive selling by whales, miners, and institutions has intensified downward pressure on BTC’s price. The SMI Ergodic Oscillator and RVI both signal persistent bearish momentum and rising volatility. Since falling below the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin [BTC] has remained under that level for eight straight days, a stretch of losses not seen since the post-Liberation Day dip in early April. In fact, at press time, Bitcoin was trading at $92,229, up 0.38% on daily charts. Before these minor gains, BTC had been on a downward trajectory, dropping by 11.03% on weekly charts. Amid this prolonged bearish trend, prominent market players have capitulated and increased their spending significantly. Undoubtedly, BTC has continued to decline amid intense selling pressure from whales and other large entities. According to Checkonchain data, Holder Net Position Change has remained negative through Q4. Source: Checkonchain At the time of writing, this metric had declined to -60.07k BTC, the lowest levels since early August, reflecting intense selling from holders. In fact, Lookonchain observed such selling activity. According to the on-chain monitor, Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sold all his remaining 2,499 BTC, worth $228 million, via Kraken. The OG has been on an aggressive selling spree, dumping all 11k BTC, worth $1.12 billion, reflecting strong bearish sentiment from him. At the same time, BlackRock deposited another 6,735 BTC, valued at $616 million, into Coinbase Prime, further raising sell-off fears. Coupled with that, Bitcoin miners have also been on a selling spree, offloading 71.9k BTC over the past seven days. Mara Holdings is one such miner. According to Lookonchain, MARA deposited 644 BTC, worth $58.7 million, to FalconX and Coinbase Prime. Source: CryptoQuant Often, miners sell during a dip over thinning margins and are forced to offload to fund operational costs. In total, these three entities have offloaded 9,878 BTC, worth $902.7 million, over the past day. Typically, increased sales from these two groups add more pressure on an already weak market, risking further losses. According to AMBCrypto, Bitcoin’s downtrend has prolonged as it grapples with increased selling from holders. As a result, the SMI Ergodic Oscillator has remained negative for nine consecutive days, settling at -0.03 at press time, indicating sellers’ dominance. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Relative Volatility Index (RVI) has remained below 50 for eight straight days, a level that typically indicates increasing downside volatility and strengthening bearish momentum. Given these conditions, BTC remains vulnerable to further losses. If selling pressure persists alongside rising volatility, Bitcoin could dip below the $90,000 mark once again. Should the $88,000 support level break, the next key support lies near $86,482. To reverse this bearish outlook, BTC would need a daily close above $93,428.

The Bitwise XRP ETF posted $21.7M in turnover on 20 November, but will it match-up with Canary’s XRPC? The Bitwise XRP ETF reported $21.7 million in turnover, with 1.13 million shares traded, but closed 7% lower at $22.46 after opening at $24.15. Canary’s XRPC controls $268.88M in assets with $292.61M in cumulative inflows since launch, while still recording $15.82M in fresh inflows on 19 November. Finviz data shows the XRP ETF opened at $24.15, traded between $24.15 and $22.12, and closed at $22.46—reflecting a 7% decline from the opening print. Total dollar volume reached approximately $26 million, indicating significant participation from active traders and market makers. Source: Finviz According to data from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, three hours before the market close, the Bitwise XRP saw $21.7 million in turnover, with more than 1.13 million shares traded. The launch marks the second U.S. spot XRP ETF to hit the market, arriving one week after Canary Funds’ XRPC. Bitwise enters a competitive landscape where Canary’s XRPC has already captured $292.61 million in cumulative inflows. SoSoValue data shows XRPC controls $268.88 million in total net assets, representing 0.22% of XRP’s market cap. The fund recorded $15.82 million in net inflows on 19 November alone, demonstrating sustained institutional demand days after its initial launch. Despite arriving second, Seyffart described Bitwise’s turnover as “impressive.” Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg congratulated Bitwise on the launch, noting that strong first-day activity proves “you don’t have to be BlackRock to launch a top ETF.” The ETF’s price action tracked broader crypto market weakness throughout the day. XRP’s underlying spot market experienced volatility, and the ETF traded in line with those movements. The decline into the close raises questions about whether institutional investors allocated fresh capital on Day 1 or whether activity came primarily from secondary-market trading. Official flow figures will only become available after the next settlement cycle, when authorized participants and issuers publish updated fund holdings. Platforms including SoSoValue, Farside Investors, and Bloomberg Terminal will reflect this data on 21 November. Bitwise positioned the ETF as a low-fee option for U.S.-regulated XRP exposure. Tomorrow’s data will reveal whether strong trading interest translated into meaningful institutional allocations that can compete with Canary’s head start.

Title: Bubble fears ease but investors still waiting for AI to live up to its promise
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/20/nvidia-ai-bellwether/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T22:10:35Z
Full Content:
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE Fears about the artificial intelligence boom turning into an overblown bubble have diminished for now, thanks to a stellar earnings report from Nvidia that illustrated why its indispensable chips transformed it into the world’s most valuable company. But that doesn’t mean the specter of an AI bubble won’t return in the months and years ahead as Big Tech gears up to spend trillions of dollars more on a technology the industry’s leaders believe will determine the winners and losers during the next wave of innovation. For now, at least, Nvidia has eased worries that the AI craze propelling the stock market and much of the economy for the past year is on the verge of a massive collapse. If anything, Nvidia’s quarterly report indicated that AI spending is picking up even more momentum. The highlights, released late Wednesday, included quarterly revenue of $57 billion, a 62% increase from the same time last year. That sales growth was an acceleration from the 56% increase in year-over-year revenue from the May-July quarter. What’s more, Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the current quarter covering November-January, which would be a 65% year-over-year increase. Given Nvidia’s forecasts, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. The UBS analyst also said the “AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” Nvidia’s numbers are viewed through a window that extends far beyond the Santa Clara, California, company’s headquarters because its products are needed by a wide range of companies — including Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms — to build data centers that are becoming known as AI factories. “AI spending isn’t just holding up, it’s accelerating. That’s exactly what the market needed to see,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets for investment firm Direxion. The numbers initially lifted Nvidia’s stock price by as much as 5% in Thursday’s trading, while other tech stocks tied to the AI spending frenzy also got a boost. But Nvidia’s shares and other tech stocks reversed course later in the session as investors found other issues besides AI, such as the government’s latest jobs report and the future direction of interest rates. Even with a 3% drop in its stock price amid the broader market decline, Nvidia remains valued at $4.4 trillion, more than 10 times its valuation three years ago when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, triggering the biggest technological shift since Apple released the iPhone in 2007. Nvidia’s rapid rise has turned its CEO Jensen Huang into the chief evangelist for the AI revolution and he sought to use his bully pulpit during a late Wednesday conference call with industry analysts to make a case that the spending to make technology with humanlike intelligence is just beginning. “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,” Huang insisted while celebrating “depth and breadth” of Nvidia’s growth. Huang is hardly a lone voice in the wilderness. A recent report from Gartner Inc. estimates that worldwide spending on AI will rise to more than $2 trillion next year, a 37% increase from the nearly $1.5 trillion that the research firm expects to be spent this year. But it remains to be seen if all that money pouring into AI will actually produce all the profits and productivity that proponents have been promising. That leaves the question unanswered if all the real spending that’s happening will be worth it. The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” Big Tech is already so profitable that many of the most successful finance their spending sprees with their ongoing stream of revenue and cash hoards in their bank accounts. But some companies, such as Meta Platforms and Oracle, are relying more heavily on debt to fund their AI ambitions — a strategy that has raised enough alarms among investors that their stock prices have plunged more dramatically than their peers in recent weeks. Both Meta and Oracle have suffered more than 20% declines in their stock prices since late October. But other Big Tech powerhouses leading the way in AI remain just behind Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple in the rankings of the most valuable companies. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon boast market values currently ranging from $2.3 trillion to $3.6 trillion. “It is true that valuations are high and that there is some froth in the market, however, the spending on AI is real,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for money manager Northlight Asset Management. “Whether or not the spending turns out to be overdone won’t be known for many years.” AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this story.

Title: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The conversation around XRP has grown louder in recent months as the asset continues to gain traction through ecosystem growth, Spot XRP ETFs, and market interest. Despite this momentum, XRP still sits far below Bitcoin, the industry’s dominant cryptocurrency, when comparing total valuation. That gap raises a simple question: how high would the XRP price need to climb in order to actually flip Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf provides a direct, real-time look at what XRP’s price would be if it matched Bitcoin’s market capitalization today. Although it is currently going through a correction phase, Bitcoin has the largest presence in the crypto market by an overwhelming margin, and its market capitalization currently stands at roughly $1.84 trillion. This valuation ranks Bitcoin among the largest assets on the planet, surpassing many global corporations. XRP, now trading around $2.14 at the time of writing, holds a market cap of approximately $128.7 billion. This means Bitcoin’s valuation is more than fourteen times larger than XRP’s. For XRP to flip Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency would need to rise to the same market capitalization that Bitcoin currently holds. Using the circulating supply of XRP, MarketCapOf calculates how much each XRP token would be worth if it matched Bitcoin’s market cap. Based on the latest data, XRP would need to trade at $30.61 for its total valuation to equal Bitcoin’s. This is the current “flippening price,” and it reflects the direct ratio between their two market caps. To reach the level of Bitcoin’s all-time high market cap of $2.485 trillion recorded on October 6, XRP would need to climb to about $41.26 per token. The calculation highlights how far ahead Bitcoin still is. XRP sits at roughly seven percent of Bitcoin’s total valuation, meaning the asset would need to appreciate more than fourteen times from its current level to stand on equal footing. In simple terms, an investor holding 1,000 XRP would see their position shift from about $2,140 today to more than $30,000 if the token were priced at $30.61. This comparison does not assume any change in circulating supply, tokenomics, or macro factors. It is a clean and direct valuation exercise based purely on market capitalization. However, even in its simplicity, it shows the scale of inflows required for XRP to close the gap and flip Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency rankings. Recent months have seen stronger activity in the Ripple ecosystem, most especially with new partnerships and acquisitions by Ripple. Added to this is the expanding conversation around Spot XRP ETFs, which many analysts believe could introduce significant liquidity if major issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale fully enter the space. The newest entrant is Bitwise, which launched its Spot XRP ETF just hours ago.

Title: From Big To Bigger: Abu Dhabi Investment Council Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/from-big-to-bigger-abu-dhabi-investment-council-triples-bitcoin-etf-exposure/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T22:00:24Z
Full Content:
Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, growing from about 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by September 30. The position was valued at roughly $518 million at quarter end. According to market reports, that build-up happened just before Bitcoin hit new highs in early October, when prices crossed the $125,000 mark. The timing left the fund with a much larger exposure to Bitcoin-linked ETFs right as investor sentiment became far more volatile. A sovereign fund increasing an ETF position by this scale sends a clear message about how some big public investors now see crypto: as an asset class worth holding. That does not mean the bet is risk-free. ETF shares can be redeemed, market swings can be sharp, and paper gains can evaporate quickly when prices reverse. Reports indicate ADIC treated the ETF as a long-term store of value, but short-term price action has already tested that view. JUST IN: 🇦🇪 UAE state fund triples its stake in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 19, 2025 Spot ETFs then faced heavy redemptions in November. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a record single-day outflow of about $523 million, marking the largest one-day withdrawal since the ETF launched in January 2024. The outflow was part of a run of redemptions that month and signaled growing caution among some holders. Those redemptions came as bitcoin slid from its October highs. The pullback has left some big buyers holding positions that look less favorable on paper. Some analysts argue these moves—both buying and selling at scale—are part of a normal allocation cycle for institutional investors. Others warn rapid inflows and outflows can magnify price swings for everyone in the market. According to the coverage, ADIC’s increase shows that parts of the global investing community are prepared to use regulated US ETFs to gain bitcoin exposure. That preference for regulated vehicles can increase the pool of buyers in good times, while also creating new pressure points when sentiment shifts and large redemptions occur. A big public fund made a bold move into bitcoin via a major US ETF and did so just before the market cooled. The trade highlights both the growing mainstream interest in crypto and the risks that come with fast moves in and out of large ETF positions. In the meantime, the facts are straightforward: holdings spiked to nearly 8 million IBIT shares worth about $518 million at quarter end, and the ETF later saw a record $523 million single-day outflow as prices fell from early October highs.

Title: Why were stocks down today? What to know as Dow gives up 700-point gain

U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. "Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026," wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. "This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute," said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. "After all, after the headlines settle, stocks ultimately trade on earnings." And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. "NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat," said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. "Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth," she said. "Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. "Investors looking for an explanation for the current market pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced," said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. "Questions around the Fed’s interest-rate path, labor market, legal ruling on tariffs, and government shutdown are just a few of them. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result." The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. "Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we’re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy," Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering "what’s typically a seasonally strong stretch," Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase "Santa Claus rally." The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Nvidia-Led Rally Reverses Course; Walmart Stock Soars

Shares of the world's most valuable company lost hold of their early gains after a blowout earnings report, while a big-box retailer soared after its latest quarterly results surpassed expectations. Major U.S. equities indexes finished Thursday's session in the red after overdue September jobs data sent mixed signals. The tech sector led the declines, as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back from their early advance in the wake of the AI chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results to close 3.2% lower. Nvidia was one of the day's worst-performing stocks in the Dow, which slid 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.2%. See here for more from Investopedia on Thursday's market action. Shares of other AI chipmakers lost ground along with Nvidia. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8% and Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2%, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index registering a nearly 5% decline. Nvidia memory chip partner Micron Technology (MU) tumbled 10.9%. Jacobs Solutions (J) shares lost the most of any stock in the S&P 500, dropping close to 11% after the engineering and consulting company reported a year-over-year decline in quarterly profits. The company said the results reflected a change in value of its investment in Amentum (AMTM), which was spun off from the company last year and combined its former intelligence arm with its cyber and critical mission solutions business. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its downtrend to hover around $87,000. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers crypto trading on its platform, dropped about 10%, while shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell 7.4%. Walmart (WMT) shares jumped nearly 7% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the retail giant's earnings topped analysts' estimates. Year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and advertising revenue helped drive the strong performance, in what could be a positive signal for U.S. consumer spending heading into the height of the holiday season. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of its Eylea HD eye treatment for patients with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Regulators also greenlighted a monthly dosing option for Eylea HD for patients a variety of eye conditions. Regeneron shares advanced 5%. Shares of Solventum (SOLV), the health care company that was spun off from 3M (MMM) last year, gained close to 3%. The push higher followed Solventum's announcement that it had agreed to acquire Acera Surgical, a bioscience firm focusing on regenerative wound care. Solventum is set to pay $725 million in cash for Acera, with up to $125 million in potential additional payments tied to reaching certain milestones.

Title: Verizon Begins Laying Off Thousands of Workers

Reading time 2 minutes Telecom giant Verizon has begun laying off some 13,000 employees as part of a new reorganization initiative. Approximately a week ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering job cuts. Now, the layoffs have begun, according to an email viewed by Gizmodo. âOur current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,â wrote Verizon’s new-ish CEO, Dan Schulma, in an email sent Thursday and shared with Gizmodo (the Journal originally reported on the email). âWe must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,â the top executive added. Yes, to “delight” customers, the company must apparently very much not delight its workforce. Schulman, who took over the top spot in October, said in the email that the layoffs would reduce Verizon’s “outsourced and outside labor expenses.” To help the workers who are losing their jobs, Verizon has established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund, Schulman said. This fund will “focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps,” he shared. The CEO added that technological change was sweeping through the economy.Â “Changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries,” he wrote. “Change is necessary, but it can be difficultâespecially when it affects valued teammates. Itâs important that we direct our energy and resources to set Verizon on a path to success. The actions weâre taking are designed to make us faster and more focused, positioning our company to deliver for our customers while continuing to capture new growth opportunities.” When it comes to job security, this has been a tough year for tech workers. Amazon recently announced 14,000 layoffs, Accenture and Synopsis have announced thousands of layoffs, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle have made similarly dour announcements, and Intel has promised to reduce its workforce by a whopping 25,000. There are many other tech companies that have made similar moves over the last twelve months. Yes, lots and lots of people are getting fired right now, and, according to reports, it’s increasingly difficult for entry-level workers to find positions. Some people blame AI (which is promising to help America’s C-suite gut certain segments of their corporate workforce) while others merely blame our shitty economy, which seems to be suffering under the yoke of the Trump administration’s dopy fiscal policies. There’s no reason why both can’t be to blame. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Silicon Valley is in its downsizing era, and it’s not so much fun.

Private credit and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. November 20, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset management arm is pitching private markets as essential ballast to investor portfolios amid stretched stock valuations and unreliable bond hedges. With stock gains increasingly driven by a handful of large caps and bonds potentially offering less protection in downturns, the traditional 60/40 portfolio mix needs reinforcement, the $4 trillion asset manager said in its 2026 investment outlook. Private credit, so-called secondaries — markets where limited partners can sell their stakes to other institutions — and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. “A key reason for having bonds in a portfolio is that they are supposed to zag when stocks zig. But if stocks zig and bonds zig too, then you lose the diversification benefit from diversification into bonds,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This is where alternatives come in.” Private credit is the centerpiece of JPMorgan’s view, with strategists pointing to its “healthy premium” over public debt. But they also highlight the need for range of investments as ways to build resilience if growth slows.

But the recent surge of institutional flows into private markets signals something more permanent. What once lived at the edges of a portfolio is now being folded into its foundation. The shift isn’t without controversy. Critics warn that some of the benefits — from diversification to downside protection — may not hold when markets come under pressure. Liquidity gaps and opaque pricing remain key concerns as more capital moves in. Still, JPMorgan’s “60/40+” framing captures a broader turn: The old playbook hasn’t been discarded, but it is being rewritten — this time around assets that used to sit on the sidelines. Kelly argues that investors can reallocate to alternatives by trimming both stocks and bonds in line with their original 60/40 split — preserving balance while shifting portfolio structure. “Investors can fund a 10% position or a 20% position or a 30% position in alternatives proportionately from the 60% stocks, 40% bonds and just make each of those slices smaller,” Kelly added. “And if they do that, we think it gives better diversification, more stability in the portfolio going forward.” Related:Q&A: Is a Private Market Tokenization Revolution Coming? Read more: BlackRock Says 2% Bitcoin Allocation Is ‘Reasonable Range’ So far this year, megacap tech stocks have lifted the markets higher with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 posting double-digit gains. Still, concerns over concentrated and highly valued public AI equities — such as the Magnificent 7 comprising some 35% of the S&P 500 and the index’s forward P/E reaching 23x — are pushing some investors toward alternative assets with lower market correlation. “Everyone’s very excited about AI and, indeed, we are excited about AI, too,” Kelly said. “But the question is: Does AI justify the valuations of all of these huge megacap companies, or is it going to be a day of reckoning? Chances are, eventually, something will go wrong and there will be a day of reckoning.” Looking ahead, artificial intelligence remains a central theme as the technology shifts from so-called proofs-of-concept to large-scale adoption. According to the outlook, entitled AI Lift and Economic Drift, investors are now shifting focus on where to allocate capital across the AI value chain, with private markets offering broad opportunities from venture capital to data-center infrastructure. For instance, the outlook cites how massive hyperscaler spending is effectively channeling value from public to private markets, where private equity, infrastructure and private credit funds are driving the build-outs.As for the broader economy, Kelly does not foresee a recession in the year ahead, though he admits that worries about the outlook continue to persist. Related:KKR, Apollo Back Blockchain Infrastructure Platform Corastone “We think the economy will grow at a moderate pace. Perhaps for most Americans, it’s going to feel like a pretty mediocre, disappointing economy,” Kelly said. “But there’s enough of a surge in capital spending coming from the AI boom and in consumer spending from the increase in wealth of richer households that should keep this economy growing, barring some shocks.” RIA Edge Private Markets Dec 4, 2025 New York The only forum designed exclusively for senior RIA investment decision-makers to engage directly with the leading players in private markets.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is offering voluntary buyouts for employees in its UK offices, Business Insider has learned. An email went out to UK staff this week offering them a voluntary exit package, according to two people familiar with the matter and confirmed by a Google spokesperson. It's unclear which UK organizations the offers went to, or how many buyouts were offered. Google did not respond when asked for comment about this. "Earlier this year, some of our US teams introduced a voluntary exit programme with severance for U.S.-based Googlers, and we are now also offering the programme in the UK to support our important work ahead," the Google spokesperson said. "We are committed to investment in the UK and continue to hire for critical roles and important projects aligned with our company priorities to ensure we can deliver on the opportunity that AI offers the UK economy," they added. The voluntary buyouts are the latest example of Big Tech firms finding ways to reduce head count this year to become more efficient, flatten management structures, and lean into AI. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, while Microsoft has also offered some employees money to leave. The exact package being offered by Google in the UK would depend on how long the employee had worked at the company, staff were told. Google employs more than 7,000 people in the UK, according to its own figures. Google has offered voluntary buyouts across various parts of its US business this year, including its Android and Core engineering orgs. Much of the framing of these has been about how Google is reorienting its company around AI, and that it wants employees who aren't excited about that goal to feel like they can leave. In October, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan offered employees a voluntary exit package as part of a reorganization around AI priorities, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. "It's an incredibly exciting time at YouTube and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead. But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan wrote. Have something to share?

Title: Wall Street is rushing to raise price targets on Nvidia after spectacular earnings

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Somehow, Nvidia keeps raising the bar. The chip giant's stellar earnings for the third quarter have sparked a round of price-target raises from analysts who think the stock can climb even higher. Nvidia, the most expensive company in the world by market cap, pulled $57.01 billion in revenue, up 62% year-over-year. It estimated it would pull $65 billion the following quarter, handily beating expectations that it would issue guidance for around $61 billion in quarterly revenue. The results — and comments from CEO Jensen Huang that he believed AI was not in a bubble — was exactly what investors wanted to hear, according to Dan Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush. "Nvidia's earnings were another major validation moment for the AI Revolution and tech stocks. We also believe Nvidia will enter the $6 trillion market cap club over the next 12 to 18 months as the vision and numbers around the AI spending trend prove themselves out," he wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Here's the rundown of analysts who are also feeling more bullish on Nvidia's future: Brian Colello, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said he lifted his fair value estimate for the stock to $240 a share due to higher revenue expectations. Nvidia is paying more for input costs, but that will likely be offset by the company's strong pricing power, he added of the firm's profit outlook. "We still see Nvidia shares as undervalued and view recent AI bubble chatter as a buying opportunity. Longer-term concerns about AI funding and energy buildouts are valid in the medium to long term, but 2026 is shaping up to be another stellar AI year, in our view," Colello wrote. The new estimate implies 30% upside from the stock's current levels. Nvidia's latest results "answered the bell" as the chipmaker reported robust demand for its GB300 ramp, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. In the firm's base case, analysts see the Jensen Huang firm remaining the "dominant supplier" in the data center acceleration space. In the firm's upside scenario, analysts said they believed the stock could rise as high as $300 a share as the company takes over at least 80% of the data center ecosystem. "Industry checks suggest further upside with beats continuing as Blackwell ramps," they wrote of their long-term investment thesis on the stock. "See increased systems sales with the ramp of the GB200, further increasing the competitive moat." The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on Nvidia. Its new price target implies 35% upside from the stock's current levels. Analysts at Truist Financial said they raised their estimates on Nvidia partly because Jensen Huang's comment that AI wasn't in a bubble looked "increasingly believable." Bubble fears are the biggest overhang on Nvidia stock at the moment, the firm added. "On its conference call, NVDA noted that its A100 chips, which began shipping six years ago, are all still in the field and are running at 100% utilization. We believe this is the clearest indication that we are not in a bubble… at least not yet," the firm wrote in a client note. Nvidia also looks like it'll be lifted by its "solid" quarterly results and strong guidance over the near-term, they said. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Its new price target implies 37% upside from current levels. Analysts at Melius Research said they believed there were four things that mattered most in a note about the stock's outlook: "Revenue acceleration to 65%+ with this kind of margin at scale, benefiting from the greatest paradigm shift of my lifetime is worth more than ~25x next year's EPS," analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating. Its new price target implies 73% upside from the stock's current levels. Jump to

Title: Even Realities Even G2 Review: Anti-Meta Smart Glasses With Real Potential
URL: https://gizmodo.com/even-realities-even-g2-review-2000687632
Time Published: 2025-11-20T20:23:45Z

Reading time 11 minutes What exactly doÂ smart glasses need to be smart? If you’re Meta, the answer to that question revolves around two things: cameras and audio. Sure, the Meta Ray-Ban Display have a screen in them, but there are only a couple of major things that allÂ of Meta’s smart glasses have in common, and that’s the ability to take pictures/videos and play audio. Those features can be useful, but they also come with their own drawbacks. Not only are smart glasses with cameras and speakers less private by virtue of the fact that you’re walking around with a gadget that records discreetly from your face, but they also weigh a lot more and look less like regular glasses. Adding hardware adds heft. It’s simple math. Even Realities Even G2 The Even G2 smart glasses have a great display and nice hardware, but they're plagued by bugs. Pros Cons But just because that’s what Meta thinks a pair of smart glasses needs doesn’t mean that’s where everyone’s head is at. There are some smart glasses purveyors asking what happens when you subtract from that equation, and the results, as I’ve found with Even Realities Even G2, can be interesting, encouraging, and sometimes a little frustrating. Even Realities is perhaps the main company making what I call “anti-Meta smart glasses” right now, and it recently released the Even G2, its second pair of smart glasses without cameras or speakers. Like the Even G1 predecessor, these smart glasses center around a screen, which in this case is a dual-lens display that outputs only in monochrome green. Unlike the Even G1, the Even G2’s display gets an assist from new hardwareâthe Even R1, an optional smart ring sold separately for navigating the UI that also doubles as a health tracker. The combination of screen and smart glasses can be a promising one. While I was worried about inputs on the Even R1 feeling laggy, I actually found sliding my thumb around the ceramic smart ring to work most of the time. To activate the Even G2 displays, all you need to do is double-tap with your thumb. To scroll between menu options, you slide your thumb up or down. To select, you give the Even R1 a single tap. You can also hold your thumb down on the smart ring to bring up a quick dashboard to check notifications or activate features like the teleprompter or translate. While inputs work fairly well, they’re far from perfect. Sometimes I find myself having to double-tap multiple times to get the results I want, and other times I scroll past my intended destination in a menu. It’s not enough to make me want to toss the Even R1 out completely and give up like other smart rings I hesitate to even mention, but there’s some refinement to be done here if Even Realities wants the smart ring to be theÂ best way of navigating a pair of smart glasses. The Even R1 controls may not be as nuanced as the gestures in the Meta Ray-Ban Display, aÂ “Neural Band” wristband that reads the electrical signals in your arm, but it’s a heck of a lot less invasive, and it certainly doesn’t leave a giant red mark on your wrist afterwards. It’s also, unfortunately, $250 in addition to the $600 price tag of the Even G2 smart glasses, so there’s that. Thankfully, the smart ring is, again, optional and not required to use the Even G2. As an input system, it’s safe to call the Even R1 solid, but there’s room for future improvement. A smart ring is only part of the equation; it’s also about what you can actually doÂ with said ring that matters. In the Even G2’s case, there are quite a few features that can be nice to have when they actually work. While you obviously won’t be taking pictures or videos, listening to music, or taking calls, the Even G2 isÂ set up for things like notifications. The Even G2, through the companion app, can show you text messages from your phone, emails, messages from apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Telegram, and native calendar notifications. Most of these worked for me after enabling them in the app and then force-resetting the Even G2 (not exactly a smooth process), but I wasn’t able to get text messages to show up in iOS 26 on my iPhone 17. I should also mention that Instagram messages, which I got to work on the Even G2, decided to randomly stop working, and would only return after resetting the smart glasses completely. These are the types of quirks I found in lots of corners of the Even G2. That being said, if you do manage to get notifications working, depending on what your style is, you can choose to have the smart glasses show them automatically or have them delivered discreetly so you can go in manually and check the notifications section in the Even G2 UI. You cannot, however, respond to messages; these smart glasses are for notifications only, which is a major disadvantage compared to the Meta Ray-Ban Display that do let you reply with dictation. Another cool thing the Even G2 (when coupled with the Even R1) can do is give you information about your health. I wouldn’t call the metrics real-time by any means, though they are updated… intermittently. Maybe a little too intermittently for my taste, especially if you’re trying to do something important like tracking your heart rate or your calories burned while running. The lack of up-to-date or even real-time health stats makes this feature a little less useful or interesting than it could be. It’s hard to say what the cadence of updating is, or what triggers an update to the health app in the Even G2, but it could take a while. Sometimes the health metrics also like to disappear from the health widget entirely, which is not great. When that happens, I have to unpair and repair the glasses to get them back. Sometimes I have to reset the smart glasses entirely. Sometimes none of those things work, and I’m just screwed, and I have to wait around for things to start working again. Needless to say, none of that is ideal. Like the Oura ring, the Even R1 tracks steps, calories burned, sleep, skin temperature, heart rate, heart beat intervals, and blood oxygen. While I probably won’t find most of that useful (that’s just me, maybe you will), I did like the sleep tracking, which logs time awake, REM, core sleep, and deep sleep as separate categories. It also provides a sleep score, which one night, for me, was a 77 out of 100. The score, according to Even Realities, is calculated based on things like duration, efficiency, and the balance of the sleep stages throughout the night. Needless to say, it wasn’t the greatest night’s sleep I’ve had. If you’re just looking for a health wearable, you shouldn’t buy the Even R1 (Oura or a Samsung Galaxy Ring still does more, especially with scores and guidance), but it’s nice to have those features (when they work) on top of having a controller for your smart glasses. Other features include navigation, which can be used by selecting the “navigate” option in the Even G2’s UI or by using the onboard voice assistant. I tried navigating to the Brooklyn Museum from my apartment, and it seemed to work just fine. By saying, “Hey Even, navigate to the Brooklyn Museum,” a small map surfaces in the bottom right with turn-by-turn navigation in the bottom left. At the top-right, you’ll get the distance and the time it takes to get to your destination. If you want a larger view, you can tap once on the Even R1 or on either of the two touchpads located on each of the temple tips, and then tap to go back. I like the Even G2’s navigation both because it could be useful for biking or if you just don’t feel like pulling your phone out, but also because it looks like a lo-fi analog map from The Matrix or from the movie Alien.Â I know this probably wasn’t the intention here, but I appreciate the aesthetic either way. Like many other smart glasses, there’s also a translation feature, which has both upsides and downsides. I had my partner speak Spanish to me, which was translated into English, and I liked that the translated text seemed to do a better job of conveying the Spanish phrases in a way an English speaker would understand than other smart glasses I’ve used. It also translated fairly quickly, which is important if you’re using this feature in the real world. One thing I didn’t like, however, is that they struggled to pick certain phrases up. I can’t tell if the microphones are maybe not as powerful as on other smart glasses or if the software is just a little slow, but the Even G2 are a little harder of hearing than on Meta’s Ray-Ban Display in my experience. There’s also a feature called “Conversate,” which listens in on conversations and transcribes them in front of your eyes. Unlike other smart glasses transcription features, the Even G2 attempts to add context. When taking a work meeting, I had the Even G2’s Conversate feature activated, and the results were a little silly at times. While it did an okay job of hearing mostÂ of what was said, it also misheard things and added irrelevant context. For instance, it misheard my name and called me James Pierre, and also misunderstood when someone said the name of a website, instead providing a definition for the literal word, instead of background on the site itself. It was nice, however, to be able to go back into the Even app to review what we spoke about; here you’ll get an AI summary andÂ a transcript. In an ideal world where AI is a lot smarter than it is right now, Conversate could potentially be useful, but as it stands, features like Conversate are hit-or-miss, no matter how well-intentioned they are. Lastly, there are separate widgets in the Even G2 for news and for stocks, if that’s your jam. Scrolling through them isn’t ideal from a UI perspective since you have to actually tap through one article to get to the next, but it is sharp enough to be legible. To scroll, you can use the Even R1 or the glasses’ touch controls on the tips of the Even G2. Stocks seemed to work okay, though I don’t have any money, so I don’t think that’ll be a feature that I use much. If you doÂ have money, you can add your preferred stocks via the Even app, and they’ll show up in a separate widget inside the Even G2 UI. Altogether, the features inside the Even G2 are actually thoughtful, though due to some bugginess with the app and the hardware, they’re not quite as useful as they could be at this point. I want to hope that they can get better with time, but for now, this is the level of polish I’m able to comment on. And speaking of polish, I should also note here that I had quite a few issues trying to get the Even G2 set up, where neither it nor the R1 would stay connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth. As I understand from some digging on Reddit, finicky Bluetooth connections are a common complaint among owners of the Even G1, and there’s a chance that those issues may have carried over into the second generation. While I was eventually able to get the smart glasses stable enough for testing by resetting them and updating the firmware in both devices, you should be aware of those pitfalls before you buy, and brace yourself for them not improving over time. One thing I really like about the Even G2 and the Even R1 is the hardware. Even Realities’ whole shtick is that its smart glasses are glasses first, and on that front, the Even G2 succeed. Because of the lack of cameras and speakers, they’re lightweight at just 36.5g as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are 69g. The use of titanium for the frames also helps keep the Even G2 light. They feel great on my face, and they fit my head well, too, which is a major plus. I wore the Even G2 and the Even R1 for almost the entirety of a workday, which in my case is like 10 hours, and I wasn’t ready to rip them off my face, nor did they leave huge marks on my head and nose. If I were to wear one pair of smart glasses all the time, this might be it. The look might not be for everyone, but I like the slightly rounded frames and the metal arms. On the tips of each arm, there are also touch controls for navigating the smart glasses and waking them up. One tap is select, two taps wake them up or goes back in the UI, and swiping to the front or to the back wheels the Even G2’s menus up or down, respectively. I also appreciate the screen, which Even Realities is calling the 3D floating display, a dual-lens system that uses micro LED. Even Realities says that the Even G2 is 50% sharper than the first generation of glasses, thanks to its redesigned optical system, and I believe that figure. Overall, I find the Even G2 to have a much sharper display than the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which makes reading notifications or even full-on articles easy on the eyes. The display isn’t the brightest in the worldâit’s 1,200 nits as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which can go up to 5,000 nitsâbut it’s not slouching either. It’s also adjustable in the Even app so you can choose whether you want the display to appear mid, near, or far, and even position where the screen shows up in a vertical alignment (top or bottom). Having used AR glasses that don’t have adjustable screens in the past, this could be the difference between being able to see the display or not for some people. Sure, you’re not getting any color through the Even G2 waveguides, but for what the smart glasses are going for, I think the display is done well. While the screen is generally non-invasive, it’ll depend on what exactly you’re doing with the Even G2. For instance, things like notifications will appear in smaller boxes that disappear in 10 seconds by default, while the main menu can take up about 25% of the lenses depending on what your settings are in the display section of the app (again, there are settings for near, mid, and far as well as height options). To get a sense, when a new article is fully open, you’ll get a headline, a subhead, and most or all of the first paragraph. All of the menus inside the Even G2 are quite simple, usually consisting of text inside a box (the news widget, for example) or maybe graphs and numbers (the stock widget and health widget). They’re meant for at-a-glance information and nothing more. As long as you’re okay with glanceable chunks of data, like the time, temperature, date, orÂ number-based health metrics and email subjects/snippets, the Even G2 will most likely satisfy you with its display legibility and simplified UI. Battery life on the Even G2 glasses and the Even R1 ring is fairly solid. Even Realities advertises about two days of use, and after using the glasses and ring intermittently throughout the day for a period of about 10 hours, both were around 80%. To charge the Even G2, there’s an included charging case, while the Even R1 ring uses an included magnetic charger, which is a small pedestal connected to a USB-C cable. You can check the Even G2 and Even R1 battery life in the app to see if you need more juice. If you wear prescription lenses, you’re in luck here; the Even G2 supports people who need to actually wear glasses. The display is easily my favorite part of the Even G2, and while it doesn’t support full color, I can’t say I’m super bummed about that, given what the glasses are designed to do at this juncture in time. For notifications and navigation, all you need is a sharp, bright, Matrix-esque screen. Despite how frustrating the Even G2 and the Even R1 were to set up and how annoying they are when they stop working correctly, I weirdly see the potential of a pair of smart glasses that could be something functional. Could be, that is. Right now, the Even G2 and the Even R1 feel like a work in progress, like a lot of other smart glasses, and while the ideas are interesting, they’re just not as practical as they ought to be for the price they’re being sold. Maybe Even Realities can get the Even G2 and the Even R1 up to snuff with software updates and fixes to the Bluetooth bugs I experienced, but who knows what the future holds. Some Even G1 users were legitimately upset about the launch of the Even G2 since theyÂ had faith that Even Realities would refine its first-gen smart glasses before plowing ahead to a new pair. Obviously, that didn’t happen, and because of that, there’s no reason to think Even Realities won’t do the same thing with the Even G2. With that context and my firsthand experience, it’s hard to consider the Even G2 and the Even R1 as anything more than fairly nice hardware with some potential. If you’re willing to spend (checks notes) $600 on the smart glasses or $850 to also get the smart ring, then who am I to stop you? But if that potential doesn’t ultimately amount to much, you can’t say you haven’t been warned.

Title: Stocks stay on rollercoaster despite strong Nvidia earnings

By Lewis Krauskopf and Dhara Ranasinghe NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Nvidia Corp's strong earnings report offered only a brief reprieve from worries that have plagued stocks about the return on relentless artificial intelligence investment and lofty valuations on Wall Street. AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday surprised Wall Street with accelerating growth after several quarters of slowing sales and a fourth-quarter forecast that exceeded expectations. Initial relief across world stocks, however, turned sour on Thursday as investors refocused on the negatives that pulled the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off record highs hit late last month. Investors also grappled with the delayed release of September payrolls data that solidified the belief that the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates for a third straight meeting in December. "This is a coordinated risk off trade — tech stocks, crypto, etc on worries about valuations and leverage," said Nationwide Chief Market Strategist Mark Hackett. "The fact that it is an intraday decline rather than a drop at the open suggests exhaustion." Nvidia's upbeat results did not dispel concern around a fall back to earth for highly-valued tech stocks, amid lingering concerns about whether AI spending will pay off. Nvidia's results "are encouraging and support the AI story," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. "But ... I think there's broad skepticism over the next one-to-three years whether AI is going to be able to deliver on the return side." Global stocks have now dropped over 3% this month in part driven by concerns that a rally in tech shares has gone too far, too fast. "The concerns around tech will persist and each quarter we are likely to come across the same concerns as markets question the concentration," said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. "That story won’t go away." Shah said that while she was overweight U.S. stocks, she was also wary of concentration risks and this was one reason why she was looking at European shares. AI COMPANY RESULTS AS IMPORTANT AS DATA PRINTS Investors and analysts say that as AI emerges as a so-called mega-trend, market sentiment hangs on earnings results from chipmaker Nvidia, a bellwether for the AI build-out, and other technology companies. They are as key to shaping views on the economic outlook as monthly economic releases. Nvidia's shares were down over 2% after rallying sharply in early trade. The S&P 500 was off 1.2% and the Nasdaq was down 1.7% after both had climbed sharply earlier. MSCI's index of global shares was off 0.7%. Morgan Stanley on Thursday said it scrapped its forecast that the Fed would cut interest rates by a quarter-point at its December meeting after the Labor Department released data showing a greater-than-expected 119,000 non-farm payrolls increase in September. The report was more than a month late due to the government shutdown. "It's a sense that the Fed is still driving in the fog and we're not going to get any support from monetary policy in the short term," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. "I think that's been a larger influence (in the market today) than the questioning about AI valuations." "The positive here is the most speculative fringes of the market are getting a much-needed sell-off." Fed Governor Lisa Cook didn't help sentiment, saying that historically elevated prices in equities, corporate bonds, housing and leveraged-loan markets may portend a large pullback in valuations. AI, TECH STOCK CONCERNS REMAIN Thursday's action showed that investors need to brace for a bumpy ride. "Investors do need to worry about bubble risks," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told reporters on a call about the 2026 outlook on Thursday. The so-called "Magnificent Seven" - including Nvidia and Meta - have seen their share prices soar over the past several years, fuelling fears about the scale of market exposure to just a few names. Technology firms are among the stock market's big fallers in recent days, although they are still well up on the year. The S&P 500 tech sector's forward price/earnings ratio - a measure of how much a company is worth compared to future earnings - was recently about 30 times, well above its 10-year average of 22.2. The AI stocks frenzy has drawn comparisons with the 1990s dotcom boom and bust, while concerns were rising about debt taken on by tech firms. Nvidia produced $60 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, said in a note. To justify its current stock price, it would need to produce $2.1 trillion in annual cash flows within 10 years, he said. On Wednesday, speaking before the Nvidia results, Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, said it was underweight megacap stocks. While it had not sold down the stocks in most portfolios, it has been hedging with derivatives that give it the option to sell them instead, Amundi's CIO, Vincent Mortier, said.

Presently he works as Director of Energy Security and Supply Chains, at Strategy… More Info The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code. Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion. Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just about crude exports and arms sales; the message has become different. It represents a multi-layered energy, technology, and supply-chain bargain that puts Aramco at the center, with geopolitics written into it in capitals. For decades, Aramco’s main asset in the USA has been Motiva in Port Arthur, Texas. Its role is clear: Motiva has completed a debottlenecking that makes Port Arthur the largest refinery in the US, capable of processing about 654,000 bpd. Aramco indicated in May 2025 that it will invest another $3.4 billion to further integrate the refinery into a larger petrochemicals and fuels complex. The current moves made by Saudi Arabia and Aramco show, however, a sweeping change from crude oil to American-made supply chain products, as these downstream dollars sit alongside a sweeping web of MOUs with US industrial and service champions: At the same time, the Kingdom and Aramco have set their sights on access to US financial services and capital markets. Both are already showing results, as seen in the agreements with PIMCO, State Street, Wellington, and Wall Street banks, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. The main moves are to create dedicated vehicles, such as a “Fund of One,” to channel Saudi capital into US infrastructure and transition assets. The 'Fund of One' is a financial mechanism that enables Saudi Arabia to invest its capital directly in specific US projects, thereby supporting the US economy and safeguarding its long-term interests. Related: New Iraqi Leadership Confronts Water Shortage and Economic Strain While most are focusing on the synergies between US President Trump and his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kingdom's underlying strategic moves are guided by the well-known Saudi Vision 2030. Riyadh uses all projects and arrangements to lock in technology, services, and financing, mainly meant for local Saudi Vision 2030 projects. At the same time, these moves are diversifying Aramco’s earnings away from pure upstream oil, showcasing the company's adaptability. The Trump Administration, at the same time, wants to keep Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most prominent investors and energy suppliers, deeply entangled in the US industrial base amid growing competition with China. The most strategic moves are seen in the LNG sphere. The Saudi oil giant is pursuing a clear gas pivot, while the USA sees it as an export machine. This shift has significant geopolitical implications, as it not only changes the dynamics of the global gas trade but also impacts the energy security strategies of both Saudi Arabia and the USA. Again, geopolitics, economics, and strategy are merging. Natural gas is the most strategic part of all. Saudi Arabia’s leading revenue maker, Aramco, has slowly but steadily repositioned itself from an oil-only behemoth toward becoming a serious LNG player. US export capacity has been assessed and approved as one of its main springboards. LNG markets have been woken up since April 2025 by Saudi moves, following the signing of a 20-year sale-and-purchase agreement by a subsidiary of Aramco with NextDecade. The latter SPA entails the delivery of 1.2 Mtpa of LNG from Train 4 of the Rio Grande project in Texas. According to current info, the project’s first phase is already under construction, with full build-out expected to cost around $18 billion. A year earlier, in June 2024, Aramco had already struck a heads-of-agreement with Sempra Infrastructure for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion. The HOA also includes an option to take a 25 percent equity stake. Since May 2025, Aramco has been framing these commitments, 6.2 Mtpa initially, holding an ambition to reach 7.5 Mtpa by 2030. For the Saudis, these deals are seen as the backbone of a global gas portfolio that complements their oil exports. On the geopolitical stage, these deals and strategies are doing three things: Trump is also looking at a significant win, as Saudi capital and contracts will support US LNG expansion. This will significantly enhance Washington's power to lock in long-term influence over the global gas trade, a testament to the weight of these strategic moves. Another significant issue should also be addressed, linked to a combination of supply chains, critical minerals, and de-risking from China. Both parties have been very subtle in their moves to rewire supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Already at the broader US–Saudi Investment Forum, both parties have flagged agreements not only in energy but also in critical minerals and industrial inputs central to batteries, renewables, and advanced manufacturing. The goals of Aramco in this regard are clear; they want to secure long-term access to catalysts, metals, control systems, and specialized equipment that underpin both conventional and low-carbon projects. Washington’s goal is to ensure that a key Middle Eastern partner sources more of its strategic inputs from American or allied producers rather than from Chinese suppliers, as Trump seeks to counter or mitigate Beijing's growing influence in the Kingdom. For both parties, it is a form of mutual de-risking. The need for supply-chain interdependence matters to both. While Washington wants to block China, Riyadh wants the option to arbitrage between US, European, and Asian suppliers. Current Aramco-led deals are effectively creating a new layer of sunk-cost interdependence. If in place, these will make a sharp political rupture more expensive for both capitals. Overall, energy and AI are also explicitly fused into the relationship. Both countries have announced a US–Saudi AI Strategic Partnership aimed at making the Kingdom a “global AI leader.” Washington is reportedly considering approving the first sales of advanced AI chips to the Saudi venture Humain. The latter would open a controlled channel for high-end semiconductors into the Kingdom. Again, Aramco plays a pivotal role in all of this. In recent months, Aramco has already announced partnerships with Nvidia for AI and robotics infrastructure, AWS for cloud and environmental digitalization, and Qualcomm for advanced industrial connectivity. The geopolitical cloud is very relevant, as AI will give Aramco an operational edge, especially by enabling it to model reservoirs more effectively, optimize production and trading, and monitor infrastructure for cyber and physical threats. Again, the Kingdom’s role as the world’s default swing producer and system stabilizer is at play. The Saudi-US tech stack will also serve as a counterweight to Chinese solutions from firms like Huawei. Washington will also gain export control leverage, as it retains the ability to tighten or loosen access to advanced chips and cloud services. This will increase US leverage on Saudi decision-making, this time outside of oil and gas. It is also part of a new systemology that complements or substitutes for traditional defense and arms sales tools. Aramco’s main AI goal is not only focused on efficiency but also on gaining access to US-centered digital ecosystems. Beijing, as the leading competitor, will certainly notice this new alignment. International media have been discussing, especially, nuclear energy, defense, and security. Trump has clearly framed the broader package as a historic deepening of economic and defense ties, highlighting up to $1 trillion in prospective Saudi spending that spans nuclear energy, F-35 fighter jets, advanced chips, and energy investments. A Saudi-US civilian nuclear deal, worth several billions of dollars, was also signed after years of slow negotiations. Washington has clearly indicated that it wants Saudi nuclear and AI development to happen under American, not Beijing’s, umbrella. Even though Aramco is not a defense company, all its deals cannot be separated from the security architecture surrounding them, including oil and gas security, infrastructure hardening, and gas as a strategic commodity. Reality is again that all of the latter amounts to a renewed oil-for-security bargain. The only change is that it has been set up in a much more complex form: crude plus LNG, plus AI and chips, backed by US naval power and advanced weapons. Optimism is high, but….the proof is in the eating of the pudding, or maybe in this case, a bowl of Umm Ali. The MOUs will need to move from paper-based to hard assets. It is still to be seen how much of the $120 billion in Aramco MOUs will materialize into contracts, equity stakes, or shovel-ready projects. At the same time, will there be more or deeper US equity in Saudi projects? As Saudi Arabia opens more upstream and downstream assets to international capital – from gas fields to petrochemical complexes – US firms could seek larger equity stakes. Washington will push for this to balance the substantial positions held by Chinese and other Asian companies. Nuclear will be a long-term project; assessments will be needed. At the same time, all deals will be affected by political risk in both capitals. On the sidelines of all, but not to be forgotten, GCC countries will be assessing the changes too. Qatar and the UAE will be reassessing their relative positions towards the USA and within their existing bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia will be seeking a more prominent position, perhaps at Qatar's expense. As stated before, the situation is in flux and moving to different levels. When looking at the US-Saudi relationship, current moves are not a nostalgic return to the 1970s oil-for-bases deal, but a 21st-century variant in which Aramco serves as the hinge between hydrocarbons, LNG, digital infrastructure, and security. Washington will use its LNG-AI-high-end manufacturing links to ensure that a critical Gulf power stays within the Western strategic orbit and helps underwrite Atlantic energy security in an era of great-power rivalry. Riyadh’s position is clear: by locking in US infrastructure, chips, capital, and naval protection, it buys not only insurance for its own diversification but also supports Aramco’s transition from a pure oil major to a broader energy-and-technology platform. The coming months and years will depend on whether both sides can manage the inevitable frictions (human rights, regional wars, OPEC+ policy, or China) without lunging into a position of weaponizing the very interdependence they are now deepening. If successful, the Aramco-led wave of deals could mark the beginning of a more stable, if more complex, US–Saudi compact. In case of a significant failure, markets will need to understand that the same network of LNG contracts, AI clouds, and supply-chain ties will become the terrain on which the next phase of geopolitical competition is fought. For current developments, a clearer option exists: the personal relationship between MBS and Trump, two transactional powers holding options to change a region. As long as both sides can prevent a Zelensky situation, positive results can be made.

Title: Bitcoin, stocks crumble after Nvidia earnings and Fed uncertainty over next rate cut

Time Published: 2025-11-20T19:00:00Z

Bitcoin weakness persists as the BTC price drops to $86,000, alongside a US stock market sell-off and diminishing odds of a 50-basis-point Fed interest rate cut at the next FOMC. Key takeaways: A Q1 2025 fractal and oversold market conditions suggest BTC could consolidate before retesting the $98,000 to $100,000 zone. One analyst made a bold price prediction, suggesting that a rising wedge breakdown could open the door to a deeper correction, potentially reaching $30,000. Bitcoin (BTC) jumped after Nvidia Corp.’s stronger-than-expected revenue outlook helped calm fears of an overheating AI bubble, but the gains quickly reversed as the Dow gave up a 700-point rally to turn negative and US stocks sold off. WHY are markets crashing? Our logical explanation:There is quite literally only ONE headline that can even be partially blamed for such a sudden market crash.At 11:20 AM ET, the US Labor Department said the November and October employment "situation" will be released on… pic.twitter.com/zubNQstd5l Bitcoin fell to a new monthly low of $86,400, and data suggest more downside could be on the way. Bitcoin’s recent pullback is echoing the same bullish reversal structure that unfolded in Q1 2025, said analyst Cas Abbé. Back then, BTC lost momentum near its fresh all-time high, slipped below a key support level and decoupled from a rising stock market before bottoming out in a multi-week accumulation range. Abbé’s chart below shows the pattern resurfaced almost identically in recent months, with the analyst adding that BTC will likely enter “consolidation between $85,000 to $100,000 for 3 to 4 weeks.” More importantly, both corrections were driven by broader macro fears. In Q1 2025, the sell-off was sparked by the US tariff war. This time, the catalyst has been panic over a potential AI bubble, anxieties that weighed heavily on tech stocks and spilled into crypto before Nvidia’s upbeat revenue outlook helped calm markets. The fractal raised Bitcoin’s odds of retesting $100,000 as resistance by year’s end. Analyst BitBull supported the bullish reversal outlook, though his view leans more on the technical structure of Bitcoin’s descending channel and its deeply oversold conditions as of Thursday. BTC traded near the lower boundary of this multi-week downtrend, an area that has repeatedly acted as an accumulation zone during previous corrections. Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory for the first time in months. Related: $90K Bitcoin price is a ‘close your eyes and bid’ opportunity: Analyst Together, BitBull argued, these signals mark potential local bottoms, adding that BTC “could rally toward $98,000 to 100,000” next. Analyst AlejandroBTC took a far more bearish stance, noting that Bitcoin has officially broken down from the large rising wedge pattern he has been warning about for months. In classical technical analysis, a rising wedge breakdown typically marks the end of a major trend, with the measured move indicating a significant decline. In this case, AlejandroBTC argues the structure projects a long-term target near the $30,000 region, a level that aligns with multiple historical support zones on the weekly chart.

Title: Private Credit Firms to Swap Debt for Equity in Stressed 48Forty

Private credit lenders are poised to take control of pallet company 48Forty Solutions, about a year after providing $1.75 billion of debt to support Summit Partners’ acquisition of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A group of lenders including Antares Capital are set to take equity in 48Forty under a proposed restructuring slated to close by the end of the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Other lenders include KKR & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc., the people said. The deal would shed about $1 billion of liabilities from 48Forty’s balance sheet as lenders swap their debt for a stake, the people said. As part of the proposal, lenders including Antares will inject around $75 million of new debt into 48Forty, they said. Representatives for Antares, KKR, BlackRock and Carlyle declined to comment. 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. In cases where borrowers are struggling with their liabilities, private credit firms are more frequently swapping their debt positions for equity stakes to try and prevent losses. While swaps can produce upside, they also offer more unpredictable returns than direct loans, which are designed to provide stable income over time. Lenders proposed a debt restructuring for 48Forty earlier this year. The company, which was already paying the majority of the interest on its debt in kind, stopped paying interest in August, according to the people. FS KKR Capital Corp., a fund jointly managed by KKR and Future Standard, marked down the value of a loan to 48Forty to about 46 cents on the dollar in the third quarter, from around 86 cents a year ago, according to a filing. With the restructuring, plans to cut costs could include shuttering multiple pallet recycling plants, the people said, though no decision on closures has been made. 48Forty, which provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada, currently has 73 plants, according to its website. Lenders are also looking to appoint a new board for the company, the people said. Antares and KKR will each have two appointments, while Carlyle and BlackRock will jointly agree on one appointment, and first-lien lenders will all agree on another, they said. The last board seat will be reserved for the company’s chief executive officer. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: European stocks handed boost as amid Nvidia reporting

A wave of relief swept through European markets after Nvidia’s upbeat forecast eased concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) reliant stocks may have over elevated valuations amid analysts’ concerns. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.25 per cent to 12,024.30, lagging behind its European counterparts. Deutsche Bank upgraded insulation specialists Kingspan stock to ‘buy’ and it gained 1.98 per cent to reach €66.95. In a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland gained 0.57 per cent to reach €15.055, AIB fell 0.36 per cent to hit €8.24, and PTSB was flat. Ryanair fell 1.02 per cent, a major component, it weighed down the index alongside fellow heavy-hitter, Kerry Group which shed 0.71 per cent. London The blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 0.16, halting a five-day decline. The domestically focused FTSE 250 fell slightly to elongate its losing run. The aerospace and defence sector rebounded after a setback in the previous session. Industry heavyweights Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both gained. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca advanced about 0.40 per cent after its drug to control growth of non-cancerous tumours was approved in the United States. Miniature war-games maker Games Workshop soared 13.49 per cent and hit a record high on strong half-year forecast. Johnson Matthey shares fell 3.35 per cent after the chemicals company said finance chief Richard Pike would take on a new role as chief operating officer. Sportswear retailer JD Sports fell 3.88 per cent after forecasting annual profit at the lower end of market expectations. Additionally, Friday’s UK retail sales figures will also be on investors’ radar to gauge the nation’s economic health, after this week’s data showed inflation easing for the first time in five months. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 index gained 0.49 per cent on Thursday with investors buoyed by positive Nvidia results. In company news, Novartis AG boosted its sales targets for two key cancer drugs, underscoring confidence in its oncology pipeline, but its stocks still fell 1.76 per cent. BNP Paribas SA announced a new buyback and plans to reach a target for capital strength early as chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe seeks to reverse a recent slide in the stock price. The bank’s stocks gained 4.40 per cent. A series of European defence companies gained ground in trading. German defence giant Rheinmetall AG added 2.57 per cent while BAE Systems gained 1.77 per cent. Siemens Energy announced its biggest share buyback since the turbine maker went public five years ago amid optimism around surging data-centre investments, and added 1.14 per cent. Stellantis traded more blows with BYD saying its Chinese partner Leapmotor is selling more electric vehicles in Europe’s biggest EV market. It fell 3.04 per cent. New York Wall Street’s main indexes advanced on Thursday, with technology stocks getting a boost after Nvidia’s stellar results quelled some concerns around an AI bubble, while a firm September jobs report showed signs of a resilient economy. Nvidia gained after the world’s most valuable company forecast sales above analysts’ estimates for the final three months of the year and surpassed expectations for third-quarter revenue. Chief executive Jensen Huang shrugged off concerns about AI on a call with analysts, saying: “We see something very different.” A year-long rally in high-flying technology stocks had begun to lose some steam as investors became increasingly cautious of a potential AI bubble. Concerns about monetisation prospects over the technology, circular spending within the sector and debt issuance have weighed on markets with the Nasdaq sharply off its October high and Nvidia down sharply from its peak. Most megacap and growth stocks advanced, with Alphabet up and Meta gaining. The S&P 500 tech index was among the gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and other chip-related stocks jumping. Walmart jumped after the retailer raised its annual forecast for the second time this year and also set a December date to change its stock listing to the Nasdaq from the NYSE. – Additional reporting: Reuters, PA Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 5-day outflow streak with $75M reversal!
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-snap-5-day-outflow-streak-with-75m-reversal/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T17:00:22Z
Full Content:
Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on November 19, breaking a five-day outflow streak. Yes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47M in net inflows on 19 November, breaking a brutal 5-day outflow streak that drained institutional money. IBIT bounced back with $60.61M in inflows—a dramatic reversal from the historic $523M outflow just one day earlier on 18 November. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on 19 November, snapping a five-day outflow streak that tested institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. The reversal arrived as BTC stabilized near $90,000, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the recovery just one day after suffering its worst exodus on record. Source: SoSoValue SoSoValue data shows the turnaround marks a critical shift in sentiment. The five-day bleeding period saw institutional money flee Bitcoin ETFs as price broke below key support levels and Fed rate cut expectations collapsed. IBIT contributed $60.61 million in inflows on 19 November, completely reversing course from the historic $523 million outflow recorded on 18 November. That single-day exodus represented the largest redemption in IBIT’s history, dragging the entire ETF market into negative territory. The rapid reversal suggests institutional sellers exhausted themselves during the five-day decline. Buyers stepped in as Bitcoin held support near $89,000, viewing the dip as an accumulation opportunity rather than the start of a deeper correction. Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund added another $53.84 million in inflows, continuing its pattern of attracting institutional capital even during broader market weakness. The fund has consistently posted positive flows while larger competitors experienced volatility. Not all ETFs participated in the recovery. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded -$21.35 million in outflows, extending its own streak of redemptions. VanEck’s HODL posted -$17.63 million in exits. Meanwhile, most mid-sized and smaller ETFs, including GBTC, ARKB, BITB, and others, recorded zero net flows. The concentration of activity in IBIT and Grayscale’s mini BTC fund suggests institutional money remains selective about which vehicles they use for Bitcoin exposure. Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs now sit at $117.34 billion, representing roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Despite recent volatility, the category has maintained structural growth since its launch in January 2024. The $75 million inflow may seem modest compared to the hundreds of millions that fled during the five-day streak. But the directional change matters more than the magnitude. Breaking a five-day outflow pattern signals that institutional selling pressure has eased. If flows remain positive or neutral over the next week, it would confirm that the November selloff represented profit-taking rather than a fundamental shift in institutional demand. Bitcoin currently trades at $89,516.91, down from recent highs near $100,000 but holding above the critical $88,000-$90,000 support zone. The ETF reversal suggests institutions view current levels as attractive entry points rather than the beginning of a deeper downturn.

Continuing with recent patterns, even the most modest of crypto gains were met with waves of selling on Thursday, sending bitcoin BTC$83.722,10 back to $88,000 after a rally above $93,000 just hours earlier. The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%. Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%. Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years. Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum’s ether ETH$2.712,90, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high). A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.

Title: U.S. stocks rise on a wave of fresh optimism led by Nvidia and Walmart

Time Published: 2025-11-20T16:17:20Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time What began as a banner day for stocks turned into a major rout, as investors signaled ongoing skepticism about the longevity of the artificial intelligence boom and trimmed hopes of support from the Federal Reserve. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, and the broad S&P 500 index dropped by more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 top-tier stocks, declined by nearly 390 points. It had been up 700 points earlier in the day. Cryptocurrencies also shed billions in value: Bitcoin had fallen below $87,000 as of late Thursday afternoon, weeks after having set highs above $120,000. The stunning turnaround added further unease to an already shaky economy that has forced households to trim budgets amid stubborn inflation and signs of a wavering job market. With an ever-increasing part of the economy's principal driver — consumer spending — now reliant on affluent households, an extended market pullback could inflict wider damage. "You don’t have to have the biggest bubble in history for an expensive stock market" and end up seeing declines, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak asset management group. Traders’ hopes were boosted early Thursday by a better-than-expected jobs report that appeared to show the economy remained resilient. Even before the day began, stocks looked poised to rise after Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Yet by midday, markets had turned red. The solid September jobs report diminished the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month to lower the cost of borrowing money to spur economic activity. When investors don't have to pay as much in interest, they often put those savings into stocks. “The broad rebound in payrolls suggests diminished risks of a higher unemployment rate,” analysts with Morgan Stanley said in a note published shortly before noon. “We no longer expect a Fed cut in December.” Losses were further compounded by ongoing concerns about AI — specifically, how much more profitable the companies buying chips like Nvidia's will be. The fears were articulated Wednesday evening on X by Michael Burry, made famous by the movie "The Big Short." "Just because something is used does not mean it is profitable," he wrote. Finally, the ongoing sell-off of bitcoin indicated to some traders that a key source of support for stocks — retail or day traders — were beginning to waver on their trademark "buy the dip" mentality. "I wouldn’t say we’ve flipped from bull to bear," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group. "I would say we’ve flipped from bull to balanced market in the short term. A lot depends on whether sentiment continues to weaken." Stocks had already been showing signs of flagging in recent weeks. With Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest point since September. The long-delayed September jobs report, which showed that the United States added a sturdy 119,000 jobs, appeared to show some glimmers of hope for the economy. Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% in August to 4.4%, about 450,000 workers entered the labor force. Economists view that as evidence that job opportunities are still plentiful, despite a wave of corporate layoffs. Just before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report, Verizon told employees it planned to lay off 13,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce. The company joined a suite of other blue-chip employers that say they plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, including Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS. The details of the jobs report, which captured conditions before the government shutdown, as well more recent jobs data, suggested a more mixed picture for the U.S. economy. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. Wage growth slowed, and job totals for July and August were revised downward. The employment gains in September were concentrated in the health care, hospitality and social assistance sectors. Another snapshot of the economy came courtesy of Walmart, which on Thursday reported strong sales and raised its outlook for the year. That strength points to cracks in the economy, though. Executives said the chain is luring more high-income shoppers who are looking for bargains, and noted that lower-income families are feeling more pressure. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on an earnings call Thursday morning. Walmart's stock closed 6.5% higher. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Share this article US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75 million in net inflows yesterday, ending a five-day streak of outflows as institutional investors resumed accumulating the digital asset. BlackRock, the global investment management firm operating the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), led the buying activity alongside Grayscale’s mini ETF, which also contributed to the positive flows. These two products were the only ones driving net inflows, while most other issuers saw flat activity. VanEck and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded net outflows, signaling a more cautious stance among other providers during the market reversal. The renewed institutional interest marks a shift from recent selling pressure that had dominated Bitcoin ETF flows. BlackRock has consistently been among the top contributors to Bitcoin ETF inflows since the products launched, helping drive institutional adoption of crypto assets.

Title: Verizon Confirms Mass Layoffs, Will Eliminate 13,000+ Jobs

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. UPDATE: Verizon is set to lay off over 13,000 workers in the coming weeks as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring initiative. "Today, we will begin reducing our workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce our outsourced and other outside labor expenses," newly appointed CEO Dan Schulman writes in a memo to employees that it also published online. "Every part of the company will experience some level of change." Verizon had just over 100,000 employees as of Sept. 30, meaning the layoff will reduce the headcount by 13%. Schulman says that the company's current costs and structure limit its ability to invest in its "customer value proposition." He also argues that complexity and friction within the organization were slowing it down and frustrating customers. In the last quarter alone, the company lost 7,000 postpaid customers, while rivals T-Mobile and AT&T made significant gains. Verizon says it set up a $20 million fund focused on "skill development, digital training, and job placement" for the people it's laying off. It touted the fact that it's "the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI," which is...an interesting way to spin things. Those impacted in the US will be notified today, while those in other regions will be notified in the coming weeks, The Wall Street Journal reports. Original Story (11/14): Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: BlackRock’s Staked Ethereum ETF Play Could Supercharge Bitcoin Hyper
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/blackrock-staked-ethereum-etf-bitcoin-hyper-layer2-presale/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T15:20:16Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: BlackRock just spun up a new trust in Delaware for an iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, signaling phase two of institutional crypto: yield on-chain, wrapped in TradFi. Roughly 15 months after launching its flagship Ethereum ETF, $ETHA, the asset management giant is now lining up a product that combines $ETH price exposure with staking rewards. $ETHA, which launched in July 2024, has already pulled in around $13B in inflows and quickly became one of the most successful spot Ethereum ETFs on the market. The key detail: ETHA itself does not stake its $ETH, so investors get pure price exposure alone, and nothing from the roughly 4% average staking yield that validators earn on-chain. The new trust changes that equation. A staked $ETH ETF would transform Ethereum exposure into a total-return product, tacking on staking yield to capital gains. That kind of structure is tailor-made for institutions that want the benefits of blockchain without running their own validator infrastructure or worrying about slashing risks. When big money gets comfortable with yield-bearing crypto ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the usual pattern is simple: liquidity and attention trickle down the risk curve. First majors, then high-beta infrastructure plays. In this cycle, one of the cleanest ways to express that ‘higher beta on Bitcoin’ thesis is not another meme coin, but a Bitcoin Layer-2 like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that tracks Bitcoin’s performance while adding real utility. That is where Bitcoin Hyper’s ongoing presale starts to look very interesting. Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 rollup on top of Bitcoin that batches transactions off-chain, executes them at high speed, then settles the final state back to Bitcoin Layer-1. In practice, it aims to turn Bitcoin into something that feels closer to Solana in terms of speed, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. To do this, the team uses a canonical bridge that wraps native $BTC into a compatible asset for use on the Hyper rollup. A Solana Virtual Machine environment then handles execution, enabling thousands of transactions per second and near-instant finality. This is the pain point Bitcoin Hyper goes after: Bitcoin is the largest, most trusted asset in crypto, yet still awkward to use beyond simple transfers and custody. Fees spike in every hype cycle, throughput caps out around single-digit TPS, and DeFi flows largely bypass the network. By pushing computation to an L2 while anchoring security on Bitcoin, Hyper tries to unlock that trapped value. The next logical step is infrastructure that lets those assets actually move and work in DeFi. A Bitcoin-native L2 that can route wrapped BTC into lending, DEXs, and payments is directly aligned with that shift. Add in the project’s public focus on conservative security assumptions, and the narrative becomes straightforward: a scaling solution that respects the base chain, rather than trying to replace it. On the numbers side, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $28M, with the current token price sitting at $0.013305. That puts it in the upper tier of the best crypto presales of 2025 and suggests there is real appetite for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure rather than just memes. Staking is a major part of the pitch. Early buyers can stake $HYPER for reported rewards of around 41%, turning idle presale allocations into a yield-bearing position while the team ships its roadmap. Learn how to buy and stake $HYPER today. There is also a clear roadmap-linked upside story. Our price modeling sees potential highs of $0.08625 in 2026 if Bitcoin Hyper hits its milestones around mainnet, early dApps, and DAO launch. For holders who already believe in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and see BlackRock-style products as confirmation, $HYPER acts like a leveraged play on that same thesis: more throughput, more DeFi rails, and more ways for $BTC liquidity to earn yield. In other words, while BlackRock stays tightly focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, investors who want to front-run where that institutional adoption might push demand next are looking directly at Bitcoin Layer-2s. Right now, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the few presales offering that combination of narrative fit, clear technical design, and significant capital already committed. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale.

The partnership, underscoring the growing convergence of traditional finance and DeFi infrastructures, will connect BlackRock and Morgan Stanley-backed Securitize's tokenized funds to Plume's network of over 280,000 real-world asset (RWA) holders – supposedly the largest RWA investor community globally. In essence, Securitize's institutional-grade assets gain another robust onchain venue to move, trade and earn yield at scale. All underlying assets are issued and managed under Securitize’s rigorous regulatory framework, ensuring transparency, full auditability, and compliance. Plume's Nest staking protocol lets investors move, trade, and earn yield on tokenized assets within a regulated and composable DeFi ecosystem, supported by Bluprynt's Know-Your-Issuer verification system for enhanced transparency and trust. "Through Plume, we’re connecting institutional-grade assets to one of the largest communities of onchain RWA holders anywhere in the world. This collaboration represents a major step toward realizing truly global, transparent, and accessible digital capital markets," Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Teddy Pornprinya, co-founder and CBO of Plume, emphasized that the on-chain world operates under the same principle as traditional markets: distribution determines scale. He explained that tokenized assets require liquidity, reach, and composability to realize their potential, capabilities Plume is uniquely positioned to provide. “Securitize sets the gold standard in compliant issuance. Plume delivers the global distribution, composability, and liquidity layer that makes these assets come alive in DeFi," Pornprinya said. The rollout starts with Hamilton Lane funds and will expand through 2026, targeting $100 million in capital, according to the press release. As a part of the deal, Bitcoin finance platform Solv plans to invest up to $10 million in Plume's RWA vaults, broadening BTC-based yield offerings with regulated, real-world asset exposures. Speaking on the matter, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, stressed BTC's role in yield-bearing markets. “As regulated on-chain markets emerge, bitcoin will underpin a new generation of yield, credit, and liquidity infrastructure, where demand for yield-bearing bitcoin with RWA-backed yields replaces passive treasuries as the next phase of institutional adoption," Chow said.

Title: BlackRock staked Ethereum ETF takes shape – All details here!

BlackRock eyes staking integration as SEC clears path for advanced crypto ETFs after Nasdaq’s July filing. It’s often the first public sign that a new ETF may be in development before formal regulatory filings. Instead of just spot exposure, this product appears to focus on staking, allowing yield generation. BlackRock is once again signaling deeper ambitions in the Ethereum [ETH] ecosystem. Fresh corporate filings in Delaware reveal a new entity named the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager is exploring a staked Ethereum product. The registration was filed by BlackRock Managing Director Daniel Schweiger, the same individual behind the firm’s original iShares Ethereum fund in 2023. This move signals a potential expansion beyond simple spot exposure, suggesting interest in yield-generating, staking-based investment products. Importantly, a Delaware name registration often serves as the first public clue that a new ETF may be in the works. Analysts believe this case is no exception, interpreting it as an early step toward a broader crypto investment strategy. This development follows Nasdaq’s updated 19b-4 filing in July, which requested approval to add staking capabilities to BlackRock’s existing iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The current filing indicates that BlackRock may be pursuing not just a new product, but also enhancing its current Ethereum offerings with staking features. This momentum comes on the heels of the SEC’s recent approval of listing options for spot Bitcoin ETFs, clearing a major regulatory barrier for more advanced crypto fund structures. In fact, according to Eric Balchunas, a memo from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) earlier this week marked the final key approval required before these derivative products launch. Remarking on which, Blachunas added, “Now it’s just a matter of when, not if. We will get the exact data as soon as we can.” This comes at a time when BlackRock appears uninterested in pursuing any altcoin ETF filings, even as institutions accelerate efforts around Solana and XRP products. Reflecting this stance, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, said, “Most of the altcoins as worthless.” For example, in October, Grayscale secured approval to enable staking for two of its U.S.-listed funds: the Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and the Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). This milestone made them the first spot-market ETFs, publicly registered under the Securities Act of 1933, to offer staking rewards—marking a significant step forward in regulated crypto investment products. Earlier this year, REX-Osprey also introduced a staking-enabled Solana ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940, later expanding its portfolio with an ETH staking fund using the same structure in September. However, while U.S. regulators and asset managers continue to navigate the complexities of staking-enabled ETFs, other markets are moving faster. Hong Kong’s ChinaAMC, for instance, launched the world’s first spot Solana [SOL] ETF earlier today, trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The product offers exposure in HKD, RMB, and USD with a 0.99% annual management fee, effectively beating U.S. competitors to market by several weeks. Thus, with Hong Kong already approving spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs, the region is positioning itself as a global hub for tokenized capital markets. Meanwhile, on the price front, Ethereum was trading at $3,023.18, down 0.88% over the past 24 hours and nearly 15% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, institutional sentiment also appears equally strained, with Ethereum ETFs recording continuous withdrawals since 11th November. On the 18th of November alone, the sector saw $74.2 million in outflows, followed by $37.4 million on the 19th of November. BlackRock’s own ETHA fund has led this downtrend, logging $165.1 million and $24.6 million in outflows on the same respective dates, the highest among its peers. Yet, despite this bearish flow cycle, regulatory milestones continue to reshape the landscape.

Title: US filings for jobless benefits remained in historically healthy range during government shutdown

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer New U.S. jobless claim applications fell last week, remaining within the healthy range of recent years, according to the government’s first weekly layoffs data since before the government shut down on Oct. 1. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 fell by 8,000 from the previous week to 220,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Data for the weeks covering the government shutdown also remained in the same range of recent years, falling between 200,000 and 250,000. Also Thursday, the Labor Department said in a separate report that U.S. employers added a surprisingly solid 119,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest since October 2021, however that’s partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market. The increase in September payrolls was more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. But Labor Department revisions shaved 33,000 jobs off July and August payrolls. The monthly jobs report — considered the most important market-moving data on the U.S. employment situation — had been delayed for seven weeks by the federal government shutdown. During the 43-day shutdown, investors, businesses, policymakers and the Federal Reserve were without much of the figures they use to diagnose the health of the American job market because federal workers had been furloughed and couldn’t collect the data. Thursday’s labor market reports come at a time of considerable uncertainty about the economy. The job market has been strained by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump’s erratic tariff policies, though economic growth at midyear was resilient. Fed policymakers are divided over whether to cut interest rates for the third time this year when they meet in December for the final time this year. Some major companies have announced job cuts this year, including Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta. Intel and The Walt Disney Co. also recently announced staff reductions, as have Verizon, General Motors,American Airlines and Amazon. Thursday’s report on weekly layoffs showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,000 to 224,250. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 8 jumped to 1.97 million, an increase of 28,000 from the previous week.

Title: Walmart Jumps To Nasdaq In Biggest Exchange Transfer On Record

Time Published: 2025-11-20T14:55:50Z

Walmart Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, said it will move its stock listing to the Nasdaq, marking the largest defection in the New York Stock Exchange’s history. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, which has been on the NYSE since 1972, said it expects its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the highest of the exchange’s three tiers, on Dec. 9. The move to the tech-heavy Nasdaq reflects Walmart’s “technology-forward approach,” the retailer said, and it will transfer the listing of nine bonds to the exchange as well. Its stock will trade under its current ticker symbol, “WMT.” Large companies have made the move before, with PepsiCo Inc. abandoning its nearly century-long listing on the NYSE in 2017. With a market capitalization of about $166 billion at the time, it was then the biggest company to transfer to Nasdaq, later topped by Linde Plc, which shifted to Nasdaq with a value of roughly $180 billion at the time. Walmart’s market cap, meanwhile, tops $800 billion. Nasdaq said last year that some 40 members of the S&P 500 have migrated, with 24 of those companies now in the Nasdaq-100 index. Both Nasdaq and the NYSE have lured companies away from each other’s venues in recent years, and moves can include perks such as marketing and cost savings. The NYSE said it’s attracted 347 companies from Nasdaq, including Virtu Financial Inc., which transferred over earlier this year. While Nasdaq and the NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., dominate US stock listings, competition from new entrants is intensifying. The upstart Texas Stock Exchange, backed by investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities, has received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and plans to begin trading in 2026. The exchanges are also grappling with the growing trend among companies to stay private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs and regulatory oversight associated with operating a publicly traded company.

November 20, 2025 09:35 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today completed its second launch in two days from its launch sites in two hemispheres, setting a new annual launch record for the Company: 18 Electron launches in 2025 with 100% mission success. The “Follow My Speed” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on November 20, 2025 at 12:43 UTC (November 21, 2025 at 1:43 am NZDT) to successfully deploy its payload for a confidential commercial customer. The mission launched just two days after the Company’s latest launch from Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, Rocket Lab’s third HASTE launch this year and sixth mission overall involving its suborbital variant of Electron for hypersonic technology test flights. These record-setting events further solidify Electron’s industry leadership as the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Rocket Lab has increased the annual launch cadence of Electron by 1,700% in less than a decade, driven by international demand for its responsive space capabilities and proven execution with pinpoint payload deployment accuracy. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Electron once again proves why it is the champion of small launch globally. These two launches serve as great examples of the team’s skill at delivering mission success for our customers anywhere, anytime, and no matter the mission profile – from a suborbital hypersonic technology demonstration to a commercial orbital mission, all within 48 hours and from opposite sides of the world. This new annual record is a proud moment for a remarkable team that continues to set new benchmarks for the launch industry.” Rocket Lab remains on track to further extend Electron’s annual launch record and end the year with more launches scheduled.

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Verizon is laying off more than 13,000 employees in mass job reductions that arrive as the telecommunications giant says it must “reorient” its entire company. The job cuts began on Thursday, per to a staff memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman. In the letter, which was seen by The Associated Press, Schulman said Verizon’s current cost structure “limits” the company’s ability to invest — pointing particularly to customer experiences. “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” Schulman wrote. He added that the company needed to simplify its operations “to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.” Verizon had nearly 100,000 full-time employees as of the end of last year, according to securities filings. A spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs announced Thursday account for about 20% of the company’s management workforce, which isn’t unionized. Verizon has faced rising competition in both the wireless phone and home internet space — particularly from AT&T, T-Mobile and other big market players. New leadership at the company has stressed the need to right the company’s direction. Schulman became CEO just last month. In the company’s most recent earnings, he stated that Verizon’s trajectory was at a “critical inflection point” — and said, rather than incremental changes, Verizon would “aggressively transform” its operations. For its third quarter of 2025, Verizon posted earnings of $4.95 billion and $33.82 billion in revenue. The carrier reported continued subscriber growth for its prepaid wireless services, but it lost a net 7,000 postpaid connections. News of coming layoffs at Verizon was reported last week by The Wall Street Journal. The outlet says that the 13,000 job cuts mark the largest-ever round of layoffs at the company. Beyond the cuts across Verizon’s workforce, Schulman said that the New York company would also “significantly reduce” its outsourced and other outside labor expenses. It’s a tough time for the job market overall — and Verizon isn’t the only company to announce sizeable workforce reductions recently. More and more layoffs have piled up at companies like Amazon, UPS, Nestlé and more. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Regardless, such cuts have raised worker anxieties across sectors. Schulman on Thursday recognized that “changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries.” He said that Verizon had established a $20 million “Reskilling and Career Transition Fund” for workers departing the company. Shares of Verizon fell just over 1% by Thursday’s close.

November 20, 2025 09:18 ET | Source: CMI CMI Burlingame, CA, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Brain Computer Interface Market is estimated to be valued at USD 2.40 Bn in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 6.16 Bn by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.4% from 2025 to 2032. Advancements in neurotechnology and artificial intelligence are accelerating the expansion of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) market. Healthcare providers are increasingly implementing BCIs for rehabilitation, communication, gaming, and human enhancement applications.

Title: Creator Economy Ad Spend Projected To Hit $37B This Year, IAB Report Says
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/iab-2025-creator-economy-ad-spend-report-1236623395/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T14:14:54Z

By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor The creator economy ad market will hit $37B this year, growing at four times the rate of the overall media industry, according to a new report on the sector. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s 2025 Creator Economy Ad Spend & Strategy Report forecast the massive growth in the sector in the U.S. this year, up 26% year-over-year. The figures point to marketers and advertisers increasingly treat contenting creators as distinct channels, rather than elements of social media campaigns, the IAB report claimed. Related Stories News Digital Talent Rep Fixated Hires Content Chief To Fill "Massive Hole" In Creator Economy News YouTube Diehard Trevor Noah Envisions A "Creator-Run World" Where Talent, Brands And Audiences Connect In "Beautiful Verticals" Spend included in IAB’s report includes direct partnerships and their paid amplification, along with ‘content adjacencies,’ defined as brands investing “intentionally run ads adjacent to creators with whom they do not have a direct partnership.” For context on the 2025 figure, media as a sector overall grew 5.7%, per a separate IAB study from September. Further to that, you can see the rate of growth in that IAB noted the overall creator economy ad spend for 2021 was $13.9B, rising to $29.5B last year. IAB projects the 2026 figure will be $43.9B, up another 18%. Watch on Deadline “Leveraging the creator economy to connect with audiences is no longer experimental for marketers – it’s essential,” said David Cohen, CEO at the IAB. “The significant growth we’re seeing reflects a deepening commitment from brands to invest in creator-driven strategies. However, with that maturity comes a need for clear standards, better measurement, and tools to navigate an incredibly fragmented ecosystem.” The IAB itself has had to pivot due to the tilt toward creators. The organization puts on the annual NewFronts in New York, a series of showcases to ad buyers dominated by streaming. As traditional NewFronts companies like YouTube, Amazon, NBCUniversal and Hulu have fallen out or shifted toward the traditional broadcast and streaming upfronts in mid-May, the IAB has branched out to gaming and creator events. Breaking the 2025 stats down, the most ad spend came from retail ($12.3B), followed by consumer packaged goods, finance, apparel, tech, auto, telecoms, travel, home, health and wellness, and media and entertainment the only vertical below $1B at $400M. IAB’s report showed marketers were most keen to pact with content creators who were managed by social media platforms such as YouTube BrandConnect and TikTok Creator Marketplace, followed by creators managed by media companies such as web publishers and TV networks and then direct outreach. Creator-specific representation agencies, which have been springing up at a significant rate, was the sixth-most popular route. Working with talent agencies such as UTA and WME and sports rep agencies, including the sports units of the Big Three, were least favored. It’s also expected AI will take a central role in creator-led campaigns with 46% of respondents currently using it for content creation and work processes and another 29% planing to do so in the next year. The stats come as TV and film companies continue to wrestle with their relationship with the creator economy. With thousands out of work following huge layoffs at media and tech giants over recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of content creators and more professionals exploring how they can apply their expertise to the creator world. IAB’s U.S. Creator Economy reaches its stats through an ad spend projection that measures the ad dollars brands invest in creators through direct partnerships. Earlier this week, credit card provider Visa released a report projecting the creator economy would hit $500B by 2027. Dade Hayes contributed to this report.

Title: ‘Blue-chip’ cryptocurrencies fall on volatile macros, profit booking by large institutions

BTC price fell from $115,699.2 level as on September 20, 2025 to $91,835.5 as on 18:30 IST, November 20, down 21 per cent. ETH fell from $4,480.41 to $3,028.86 during same period, down 32 per cent. BTC touched its all-time high of $126,198.07 just last month, while ETH hit an all-time high of $4,953.73 in August, according to investing.com and coinmarket cap. Sumit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX, said over the past month, both BTC and ETH have experienced elevated volatility primarily due to macro-driven liquidity shifts and profit-booking by short-term market participants. Bitcoin dropping below the $90,000 mark the first time since April has been influenced by US-China tariff row, tightening global liquidity, uncertainty around US fiscal conditions, and rapid position unwinding by leveraged traders. “At the same time, broader market sentiment has been oscillating, as investors reassess risk assets amid mixed inflation cues and shifting expectations around interest rate policy. Even blue-chip tokens are not insulated from these forces. However, it’s important to note that the structural fundamentals for BTC and ETH remain intact,” he said. He added that recent ETF flow data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen about $2.59 billion in outflows this month, with BlackRock’s IBIT recording roughly $1.26 billion outflows and Fidelity’s FBTC around $540 million. These outflows indicate investor repositioning, Gupta says, but they should not be interpreted as a strategic exit by major institutions. According to Vikas Gupta, Country Manager at Bybit India, while some of the recent decline appears to be driven by profit-booking rather than any meaningful exit from long-term institutional investors, BTC’s breach of key technical support levels has intensified the market reaction, triggering automated liquidations and resulting in steeper price swings. The trend line support in the $95,000–$100,000 range also appears to have been breached, leading to heavy liquidations and reducing stability at current levels. “Recent on-chain data indicates notable outflows from BTC and ETH wallets controlled by large institutions, and this is also visible in ETF redemptions led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. As a result, this has raised questions about whether large financial institutions are actually reducing their exposure to crypto assets. However, these outflows appear to be driven by short-term profit-taking and regular portfolio rebalancing rather than a long-term exit from the crypto space,” he said. Aishwary Gupta, Global Head of Payments at Polygon Labs, said technically BTC is still in a post-halving cyclical uptrend, but with much more institutional flow this time. As long as it holds its higher-lows structure on the weekly chart, the broader bull cycle remains intact, even with deep corrections. The key levels to watch are the prior cycle’s range highs as support zones, and the ETF-driven “price discovery” area as resistance. If those supports hold through macro volatility, BTC continues to behave like a high-beta, digital macro asset for 2025–26. For ETH, Gupta says, the technicals intersect more directly with fundamentals: On-chain, ETH is gradually turning into infrastructure/“tech equity” plus collateral for rollups, DeFi, and restaking. Structurally that supports a longer-term uptrend even if it underperforms BTC in phases. “From a chart perspective, the important thing is whether ETH can sustain a multi-year pattern of higher highs and higher lows against both USD and BTC. If it does, 2025–26 looks like a consolidation-plus-accumulation phase where ETH behaves like a growth asset leveraged to the broader crypto/app-chain cycle,” he said.

Title: Trump urges Scott Bessent to take Fed chair role, ‘but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury’

For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. ___ Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Title: Flipkart fintech super.money preps buy-now-pay-later play

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans. The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development. “Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout." The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface. Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category. This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised about $125 million this year, and Axio, acquired by Amazon for around $200 million, are already significant players in this space. According to Brijesh Damodaran, managing partner at Auxano Capital, a BNPL offering allows a UPI app to move beyond being just another payments button at checkout granting it greater control over the merchant interface with features such as EMI options, offers, and seamless pay-later flows. “UPI has won on volume but not on margins. But it carries zero MDR (merchant discount rate) and is heavily commoditised. BNPL or checkout credit lets a UPI app move from pure payments to credit-led revenue through interest, fees, or merchant commission," he said. MDR is the fee merchants pay to payment processors for accepting digital payments; UPI transactions have had a zero MDR regime since 2020, meaning payment apps earn no direct revenue from flows. Within the broader consumer credit landscape, BNPL is expected to grow at a robust clip of 20–35% annually over the next several years, though the big question is whether large banks, traditional card issuers, or UPI-first players like super.money will end up controlling most of the market at checkout, Damodaran added. Business basicsA spokesperson for super.money declined to comment on the new BNPL plans. However, founder Prakash Sikaria told Mint that the app had processed “around ₹740 crore of loans" last month alone through its various credit products. Apart from loans, super.money also works with a clutch of banks, including Axis Bank (for a co-branded credit card and secured cards), Utkarsh Small Finance Bank (secured credit cards and fixed deposits) and Kotak811 (secured cards and an integrated savings–spending–borrowing account). “Next year, our projection is 2 million cards. We are already among the top three issuers of RuPay cards and we want to be the largest," Sikaria said. Flipkart launched super.money beta version in June 2024 and rolled it out publicly in August that year. Since then, the app has doubled down on young, often first-time borrowers as its core market. To acquire these users, super.money leaned on a rewards-led model that offers up to 5% cashback on every UPI transaction. The strategy appears to have paid off: by September 2025, the app had climbed into the top bracket of UPI players by transaction volume, overtaking established names such as CRED, Amazon Pay, WhatsApp Pay and BHIM. Also Read | Can PhysicsWallah’s blockbuster debut revive India’s edtech dream? In September, super.money processed 256.34 million UPI transactions worth ₹9,852.44 crore, even as PhonePe and Google Pay continued to command 80–83% of the overall market, down from about 85% a year earlier. On whether such heavy cashback-led acquisition is sustainable, Sikaria said the average annual cashback per user is roughly $2–3. “Our thesis is we just need to monetize $2–3 more per user than our competition," he said. “India has a wide diversity of users; typically, monetisable users subsidise non-monetisable ones. If you can largely avoid non-monetizable users and focus on a high-Arpu (average revenue per user) segment, your average Arpu is much higher." Elaborating on secured credit products, Sikaria said that super.money sees average monthly spends of about ₹5,000–6,000 per secured card user, largely led by merchant payments. The app now has roughly 10.0–10.5 million monthly transacting users. On the revenue side, Sikaria said super.money is making about $3 million a month, which works out to an annualized revenue run rate of around $36 million at present. Flipkart’s renewed fintech bet with super.money marks its second coming in payments and lending after its PhonePe chapter. The e-commerce major bought PhonePe in 2016, but the two separated ownership in December 2022, paving the way for both to raise capital and scale on their own, with Walmart continuing as the common majority shareholder. Since then, PhonePe, led by Sameer Nigam, has filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for an initial public offering of around ₹11,000 crore and seen large secondary share sales, including General Atlantic’s $600-million deal that helped employees cover tax outgo on exercised stock options. Regulatory lensThe BNPL segment has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in recent years, especially around low-ticket unsecured lending, deferred payment products routed via prepaid instruments, and opaque pricing for borrowers. The RBI has tightened norms on digital lending and pushed lenders to hold more capital against unsecured retail portfolios. In 2023, the RBI also tightened rules around first-loss default guarantees (FLDGs), a popular comfort structure used by fintechs with their NBFC partners, where the fintech promises to cover part of the lender’s credit losses. The central bank capped such guarantees at 5% of the outstanding loan pool, after earlier market practice in some unsecured digital lending segments had reportedly gone much higher. That pushed several lending service providers to pause or redesign short-duration, small-ticket credit products as their NBFC partners reworked risk, capital and economics under the new cap. The BNPL landscapeThe UPI and BNPL market has filled up with rivals such as Navi (founded by Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal), MobiKwik, Paytm, Amazon Pay and Google Pay. In BNPL specifically, super.money’s planned products would sit alongside Snapmint and Axio, as well as captive “pay later" offerings such as Amazon Pay Later and Flipkart Pay Later, plus horizontal BNPL specialists like Simpl and LazyPay (owned by PayU). Also Read | Why Manipal and upGrad want Byju’s—and what’s really at stake now The BNPL industry in India has witnessed turbulence over the last few years, especially after high-profile setbacks like the shuttering of ZestMoney. Once a poster child for digital lending, ZestMoney ceased operations in December 2023 amid mounting non-performing assets and regulatory pressure, before parts of its loan book and technology platform were sold to DMI Finance, an NBFC lender. Layoffs and restructuring followed, and similar pressures have also hit rivals. Simpl, another leading checkout credit provider, has reportedly trimmed its workforce in October this year and faced regulatory heat, including enforcement action from the Enforcement Directorate this year. A spokesperson for super.money declined to comment on the new BNPL plans. However, founder Prakash Sikaria told Mint that the app had processed “around ₹740 crore of loans" last month alone through its various credit products. Apart from loans, super.money also works with a clutch of banks, including Axis Bank (for a co-branded credit card and secured cards), Utkarsh Small Finance Bank (secured credit cards and fixed deposits) and Kotak811 (secured cards and an integrated savings–spending–borrowing account). “Next year, our projection is 2 million cards. We are already among the top three issuers of RuPay cards and we want to be the largest," Sikaria said. Flipkart launched super.money beta version in June 2024 and rolled it out publicly in August that year. Since then, the app has doubled down on young, often first-time borrowers as its core market. To acquire these users, super.money leaned on a rewards-led model that offers up to 5% cashback on every UPI transaction. The strategy appears to have paid off: by September 2025, the app had climbed into the top bracket of UPI players by transaction volume, overtaking established names such as CRED, Amazon Pay, WhatsApp Pay and BHIM. In September, super.money processed 256.34 million UPI transactions worth ₹9,852.44 crore, even as PhonePe and Google Pay continued to command 80–83% of the overall market, down from about 85% a year earlier. On whether such heavy cashback-led acquisition is sustainable, Sikaria said the average annual cashback per user is roughly $2–3. “Our thesis is we just need to monetize $2–3 more per user than our competition," he said. “India has a wide diversity of users; typically, monetisable users subsidise non-monetisable ones. If you can largely avoid non-monetizable users and focus on a high-Arpu (average revenue per user) segment, your average Arpu is much higher." Elaborating on secured credit products, Sikaria said that super.money sees average monthly spends of about ₹5,000–6,000 per secured card user, largely led by merchant payments. The app now has roughly 10.0–10.5 million monthly transacting users. On the revenue side, Sikaria said super.money is making about $3 million a month, which works out to an annualized revenue run rate of around $36 million at present.

Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sells $1.3 billion in BTC as retail panic grows, while institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs climbs to 40% despite market fear. Owen Gunden, one of the richest early Bitcoin holders, has sold his entire Bitcoin position as retail investors flee the market and institutions continue increasing their share of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The wallet tagged as Owen Gunden by blockchain data platform Arkham transferred his last 2,499 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $228 million to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken on Thursday. In total, Gunden’s wallet has sold 11,000 Bitcoin worth around $1.3 billion since Oct. 21, liquidating his entire Bitcoin holdings, according to Arkham. Gunden’s transactions come amid growing concerns over the end of the bull market, with Bitcoin market conditions deteriorating to their “most bearish” level during the current cycle. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has declined to 20/100, or extreme bearish, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows Gunden is the eighth-richest person in crypto, with a net worth of about $561 million according to Arkham’s list of the top crypto millionaires. Gunden was an early Bitcoin arbitrage trader on exchanges like Tradehill and the now-defunct Mt. Gox. He traded 10s of thousands of Bitcoin on the exchange when it was still operational until 2014, building his onchain wealth. Related: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF Meanwhile, the institutional ownership of US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues rising to new highs, despite retail fears over the end of the bull market cycle. The institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs surged to 40% on Wednesday, wrote Bitcoin analyst Root, in an X post. This marks a significant increase from the 27% institutional ownership recorded in the second quarter of 2024, when about 1,119 firms held investments via US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 40% is based on the latest 13-F filings of institutional participants, which is a “conservative estimate” considering that only institutions managing over $100 million are required to file these reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Root said. The growing figures indicate that institutions are holding onto their shares, despite the large-scale selling by ETF shareholders, which has resulted in $2.8 billion in outflows so far in November, according to Farside Investors data.

Title: Exclusive: Former BlackRock employees raise $4.6 million for HelloTrade, a blockchain-powered trading platform

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street’s major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That’s why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. “We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.” HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren’t easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. HelloTrade’s value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. The startup’s product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade’s co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm’s crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. The two HelloTrade co-founders aren’t the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump’s friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year’s election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It’s an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Private Finance Won’t Save Nature (Blog)

If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. By Mark Opel Nov. 20, 2025 It’s easy to demonstrate the need to fund nature conservation, beyond simply funding the fight against climate change. Wildlife populations have declined 73 percent since 1970, one million species are threatened with extinction, and scientists have determined that the world has crossed seven of nine planetary boundaries. Five of the 10 greatest long-term global risks are environmental, according to the World Economic Forum, with biodiversity loss and ecological collapse ranking second among all risks to the global economy and population. Moreover, funding biodiversity is an investment, not a cost: With over half of global GDP dependent on nature, a transition to a nature-positive economy could actually generate up to $10.1 trillion in annual business value, creating 395 million jobs globally by 2030. Fighting climate change and conserving nature are not in opposition, of course. Nature will be critical to solving the climate crisis: neither biodiversity loss nor climate change will be successfully resolved unless both are tackled together. Yet while nature-based solutions can contribute about one-third of the climate change mitigation needed by 2030, nature receives only 2 percent of total climate funding. Why this disparity? The problem is that we’ve expected private finance to shoulder the burden, and it hasn’t. When I left the world of private equity to apply my finance skills to nature conservation, I had hundreds of conversations with people who used buzzwords and phrases like “innovative finance,” “market-based solutions,” and “impact investing” to describe their goal of uniting profit with conservation. “We just need to build a pipeline of investable projects” was a common refrain, and they made it sound easy to save nature and make money at the same time. When I looked, however, I found that pipeline virtually empty, and it has remained so over the past ten years. Everyone agrees that private finance will be essential to close the nearly $1 trillion annual biodiversity funding gap, but 40 years of generating “innovative finance” and “market-based solutions” have left governments still providing over 80 percent of nature funding. Climate finance is often taken as a model for financing nature conservation, but the economics are fundamentally different. In 2023, private sources provided over $1.2 trillion of climate finance out of a total of $1.9 trillion, representing 66 percent of total climate finance. The share of private finance for climate was over four times the 15 percent share of private finance for nature. The difference is that the private sector can generate attractive financial returns by investing in things like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and efficiency upgrades; these opportunities have led to massive increases in private investments addressing climate change. Similar opportunities to generate revenues and returns simply don’t exist in nature conservation. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. It’s important to remember that attractive climate investment opportunities didn’t happen on their own or through market forces. Governments implemented meaningful policies that make investing in climate solutions profitable and, in some cases, also put in place disincentives that make contributing to climate change costly. For example, in the solar industry, the United States subsidized the research and development that created the first solar panels, China’s industrial policies drove down the costs of manufacturing those panels, and Germany, China, the US, Japan, and other countries all subsidized the adoption of solar that made it attractive for consumers to install. Even now that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, they continue to need government policy support to meet the world’s climate goals. Nature conservation is going to need comparable levels of policy and regulatory support as climate, if it is going to attract private capital at the scale necessary to close the biodiversity funding gap. While there are compelling reasons for the private sector to collectively invest in nature, there is not a compelling business case for any individual business to invest in what will always be, ultimately, a public good. And however much value nature provides (and will be missed if it’s gone), companies and investors have no incentive to internalize their externalities, which will be borne by society but not accounted for on individual financial statements. We can’t blame companies, managers, or investors for this lack of investment; they are incentivized to maximize profits for their shareholders (“You must not expect unnecessary good behavior from capitalists,” as Jeremy Grantham put it). To do otherwise risks your bonus or your job as a manager and, if you are publicly traded, invites an attack on your company (see, for example, Danone) from activist hedge funds (which are also just doing their job in our current system). Being a private company not subject to public market pressures doesn’t change the incentive structure: there are few copycats of Yvon Chouinard’s strategy at Patagonia. We have seen a range of voluntary commitments on climate from large tech companies and groups of banks, but companies inevitably prioritize shareholder returns over voluntary sustainability efforts. We have therefore seen prominent climate goals in the tech sector missed, deforestation pledges fail, and coalitions like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance cease operations. This is a classic example of a market failure that must be addressed through government action. Governments need to recognize biodiversity as the public good that it is, like education and science, public health, infrastructure, and security, the sort of public good that must be funded by governments or incorporated into private investment decision-making through public policy, regulations, and incentives. The private sector is not going to step up and invest in nature voluntarily if it doesn’t increase returns to shareholders in the short term; that’s not how the game is played. However, as Tariq Fancy, former Chief Investment Officer of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock put it, governments can “fix the rules of the game.” Governments can change the rules of the game for the private sector through incentives and regulations, and can also raise funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that can then be used to directly fund investments in nature, each of which is discussed below. “To realize the potential of private sector investment in nature protection and conservation,” as Hank Paulson put it, “governments must put in place policy measures—such as tax breaks, de-risking guarantees, and regulatory requirements—that induce the private sector to invest.” Governments can incentivize the protection and restoration of nature through a variety of mechanisms, including government grants, loans, guarantees and tax incentives that encourage activities that generate positive impacts, or reduce negative impacts, on biodiversity. For example, Costa Rica’s payments for ecosystem services (PES) program pays landowners for the environmental services (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil conservation, and water purification) provided by the conservation and reforestation of their land. Funded by a tax on fossil fuels, the program has helped Costa Rica increase its forest cover from 21 percent in the late 1980s to over 50 percent today. The United States provides tax incentives to encourage private land conservation, which have resulted in the conservation of over 61 million acres of private lands, an area larger than all of the U.S. National Parks combined. A similar program in South Africa has added over one million acres to its protected area network. Government-backed entities like the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, Inter-American Development Bank, and World Bank have provided guarantees that attract private capital in debt-for-nature swaps that generate new long-term funding for nature, totaling $1.7 billion to date. And the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), launched at COP30 in Brazil, is the latest effort to provide incentives for private investment in conservation. The TFFF intends to raise $25 billion of government funding and use that to leverage $100 billion of private funding. Returns from investments of these funds will be used to pay tropical forest for the conservation and restoration of their forests. The government contributions are junior to the private contributions to the fund, de-risking the investment for the private investors. There is also massive potential for governments to shift incentives by redirecting government subsidies away from activities that harm nature toward activities that conserve and restore it. Governments currently provide $2.6 trillion of environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuel, agriculture, forestry, construction, fisheries and other industries, about three times the amount needed to close the biodiversity funding gap, and agreed to reform $500 billion of those subsidies by 2030 in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Governments can require increased private investment in nature by implementing regulations that require changes in private sector activities that impact nature and investments to implement those changes. Examples include the US Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which set limits on pollution of air and water, generated trillions of dollars of private investment and resulted in significant positive impacts on biodiversity and human health. The UK is also instituting a new regulation that requires developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of 10 percent. It is intended to make sure development will result in more or better-quality natural habitat than there was before development. The EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products requires businesses to prove that their products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation. In addition to incentives and regulations, governments can generate funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that they can then use to invest directly in biodiversity. Colombia, for example, has implemented a carbon tax that generates $100 million annually and uses 80 percent of the proceeds to fund investments in nature. The US Land and Water Conservation Fund uses earnings from offshore oil and gas leases to fund state and federal land and water conservation and has provided over $22 billion to date. Botswana’s protected area fees generate $8 million per year. Belize charges a $20 conservation fee to all tourists that directly funds its Protected Area Conservation Trust. The state of Hawaii is assessing a “Green Fee” on tourists that is projected to generate $100 million per year to invest in its natural resources. And my hometown of Boulder, Colorado, was the first city in the nation to implement a tax to conserve land, resulting in the protection of over 45,000 acres (over 70 percent of the city) and helping to make it one of the best cities to live in the country. There are also initiatives underway to develop and implement global levies on things like fossil fuels, aviation, shipping and financial transactions to generate more funds. And governments need to fund nature-related research and development (as they have in renewable energy) in areas such as sustainable agriculture that will help develop new technologies that reduce costs and lead to positive outcomes for biodiversity. Nature is in crisis, and we need fewer “finance experts” and complex voluntary efforts and more focus on generating political will. We need to embrace the irony that to get the private sector investing in nature, we have to first focus on the public sector. Leaders in all sectors who have committed to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Paris Climate Agreement must generate private finance by changing the rules of the game.

Title: Ed Dowd: It Has Begun — Housing, Credit and FCF Have Cracked … Stocks Are Next

What is a Hindenburg Omen? Why does Ed Dowd think that a deflationary event has already begun…one which will shake the world? Tune in to find out… In this podcast, I sit down with Ed Dowd, the former BlackRock portfolio manager, to discuss the AI bubble and how the stock market is entirely being propped up by just 7 companies, most of whom are engaged in what is being termed “circular financing.” That practice hearkens back to the dot.com bubble when companies engaged in what was termed ‘vendor financing.’ In other words, you pay your customers to buy your products. In this era, ‘circular financing’ is vastly more complicated in is workings, but the essence is exactly the same when the maneuvers are boiled away. Ed explained that the math just isn’t mathing. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, needs something like $900 billion of annual subscription revenue at 25% margins just for a 10% ROI. Nope, not going to happen. And certainly not before their first waves of chips wear out and have to be replaced at enormous cost. So, what happens when this bubble bursts? Ed believes that a serious market crash is in the cards. Of course, this means stocks will drop in price, but the main action is going to be in the credit markets. Treasuries will continue to advance in price (fall in yield), making them an attractive option to ride out the storm, while other forms of lesser credit will implode, as is already happening across the subprime lender space (TriColor, PrimaLend, First Brands). When will this happen? According to Ed, it already is. He tracks the Free Cash Flows (FCF) as the more important arbiter of company health and by that metric, all of the Big 7 companies are experiencing declining FCF, while Oracle’s debt is getting more and more expensive to insure against a default. And, oh by the way, stocks are at historically expensive levels, a condition that has historically resulted in very poor returns over the following years: Ed’s view is Deflation first (in housing & credit destruction), which will force the Fed back to QE again, leading to a second inflation wave (energy + money printing). At the same time, Ed views Trump and Bessent’s messaging on the economy as tone-deaf (“Greatest economy ever!”) while the real economy implodes. Ed thinks that a “Hoover scenario” is highly probable, where Trump is remembered for overseeing one of the greatest economic collapses in US history. Given all this, what should a prudent investor do? Tune in to hear Ed’s outlooks… For those who now realize that having a risk-managed approach is more important than ever, please do yourself a favor and schedule a free, no-obligation meeting with Paul Kiker’s team at Kiker Wealth Management to go over your portfolio and strategy.

Title: Nvidia’s $54B Earnings Test and Fed Minutes Put Best Wallet Token in Play

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Markets are walking a tightrope this week. Nvidia is set to report $54B+ in Q3 revenue, a figure big enough to make or break the AI trade that has driven much of 2025’s risk rally. Futures across stocks and crypto have been drifting as traders wait to see whether the world’s top AI chipmaker can justify its massive valuation and keep the AI narrative alive. Economists expect roughly 50K new jobs, a clear comedown from earlier in the year. A softer payrolls print combined with divided Fed views on further cuts would reinforce the idea that policy is slowly tilting back toward easier conditions, even if inflation is still above target. Bitcoin has already been slapped down to near seven-month lows, roughly 25–30% below its recent peak, in a pullback analysts describe as sentiment-driven rather than structural. If Nvidia smashes expectations and the macro data lean dovish, that combination could flip the switch back to ‘risk-on’ and give both Bitcoin and altcoins room for a sharp relief rally. When that kind of macro reset hits, fresh liquidity doesn’t just chase the majors. It needs rails, wallets, and launchpads that make it easy for new users to move from fiat into crypto, hop across chains, and discover the next wave of tokens. That’s where infrastructure plays come in, and it’s exactly the lane Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is trying to own with a multi-chain wallet, in-app presale access, and a presale that has already raised more than $17.2M at $0.025975 per token with around 76% staking rewards. The current non-custodial wallet landscape is messy. Newcomers juggle multiple apps, seed phrases, and gas settings across chains, while veterans still pay too much in swap fees and miss early-stage deals because everything is fragmented. Best Wallet is designed to stitch that chaos together, and Best Wallet Token is there to help. The app is a true multi-chain wallet, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base and more, letting users buy, store, deposit, send, and swap thousands of tokens from one interface. Fiat on-ramps are integrated through partners like Onramper to surface aggressive rates and lower card processing costs, which matters when altcoin rotations kick off and every percentage point of friction eats into upside. Security is handled with MPC tech from Fireblocks and cloud backups instead of exposed seed phrases, plus features like 2FA, biometric login, and advanced anti-fraud tooling. That’s aimed squarely at the next wave of users who want self-custody without feeling like they’re one mistyped word away from losing a portfolio. On top sits the $BEST token. Holding $BEST reduces transaction fees when buying or swapping crypto in-app, cuts swap costs across the 330-DEX, 30-bridge routing stack, and boosts rewards on the upcoming Best Card, which plans up to 8% cashback for heavy users. Best Wallet’s launchpad feature also gives $BEST holders early access to the best crypto presales at a ‘Phase 0’ price before wider listings, letting them rotate into new narratives faster and cheaper than users stuck on legacy wallets. This lines up neatly with where the market is heading. Tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins, and payments giants experimenting with on-chain rails all point toward a future where compliant wallets with deep DeFi hooks become the main interface for value transfer. Best Wallet is built to sit in that intersection, connecting regulated stablecoin flows with native DeFi and presale access. As capital trickles back into risk assets, a wallet-plus-token combo that makes multi-chain navigation easy could attract both first-timers and battle-hardened degen traders. Watch $BEST as onboarding demand grows. The presale is currently priced at $0.025975 per token, with more than $17.2M already raised and a sizeable social footprint across X, Telegram, and Discord. Staking is live during the presale, offering 76% APY powered by an 800M-token (8%) allocation dedicated to staking rewards. That lets early buyers immediately put idle tokens to work while the sale is still ongoing, compounding exposure if the token lists into an improving macro backdrop. Learn how to join and stake in our guide to buying $BEST tokens. If Nvidia’s earnings confirm that the AI boom still has legs and the Fed’s tone softens on the back of a weak 50K jobs print, that cocktail could refill the risk-asset punch bowl. In those conditions, a presale-stage wallet token plugged directly into multi-chain liquidity, presales, and stablecoin rails becomes a clear way to get leveraged exposure to the next adoption wave without betting on a single niche sector like meme coins or gaming. Join $BEST before the presale closes. This article is informational only, not investment advice; crypto prices and presale outcomes are highly speculative and capital is at risk.

Title: BlackRock Registers New Staked Ether Trust ETF In Delaware, Eyes SEC Approval
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-registers-new-staked-ether-trust-etf-in-delaware-eyes-sec-approval/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:39:17Z

BlackRock is seeking to go beyond simple Ether (ETH) exposure and participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus system. This comes after a recent Delaware filing revealed the $13 trillion asset management giant’s intent to enter the yield-bearing Ethereum market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Nov. 19, as noted by Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Delaware registrations are procedural first steps that have typically preceded formal exchange-traded fund applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933. The next step will involve filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form, depending on the structure of the Ether ETF, to put the product on track for regulatory approval. If approved, the proposed staking fund would complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted nearly $11.5 billion in assets under management since going live on Wall Street in July 2024. In July this year, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to add staking functionality to ETHA, a move that would allow the fund to earn rewards by validating transactions on the Ethereum network. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S. In October, Grayscale secured the greenlight to enable native staking for its U.S. Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) products, becoming the first spot-market funds registered under the Securities Act of 1933 to unlock staking rewards for holders. More recently, REX-Osprey unveiled an ETH staking fund under the less common Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently approved new generic listing standards facilitating quicker approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. BlackRock’s proposed staking-enabled Ethereum ETF could increase its appeal to yield-focused institutional investors who may have avoided ETH investment vehicles due to their lack of income.

Title: Nvidia’s $57B Quarter, Bitcoin’s Rebound, And 3 Tokens Aligned With The Next Risk Cycle
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-nvidia-report-rebounds-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:31:56Z

Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 numbers didn’t just beat expectations, they detonated them. Revenue came in at $57.01 billion, almost $2B above what Wall Street was pricing in, with a jaw-dropping $51.2 billion from data-center alone. AI spending isn’t easing off the accelerator; it’s compounding like a tech-market feedback loop on steroids. And yes, that matters for crypto. Bitcoin had slipped under $89,000 after a 27% drawdown from its $126K+ peak six weeks ago. But the moment Nvidia’s earnings hit, BTC snapped back above $91,000, and risk appetite started seeping back into the broader market. Traders suddenly remembered that the so-called “AI bubble” looks a lot more like a structural capital cycle than a blow-off top. The pattern is getting hard to ignore: Through 2024 and 2025, the correlation between high-growth tech and Bitcoin has only tightened as both assets increasingly express the same macro trade, long compute, long scarce digital assets, short fiat dilution. So the question isn’t just where Bitcoin goes next, it’s which parts of the crypto stack actually benefit from this returning liquidity. Capital is rotating into assets with real throughput, real user demand, and tangible cash-flow potential, not just shiny narratives. That’s where programmable Bitcoin layers, multi-chain wallet ecosystems, and even high-octane meme assets start to separate. Below, we look at three projects across that spectrum. One aims to fix Bitcoin’s structural limitations. One is positioning itself as the next major wallet-distribution and order-flow engine. And one is pure speculative beta packaged in meme culture, the kind that historically thrives when risk cycles flip from cautious to greedy. Together, they outline how this next phase of the market could unfold across infrastructure, utility, and culture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), effectively grafting Solana-grade parallel execution onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. The pitch is simple but powerful: let Bitcoin handle security and finality, while an SVM-powered L2 processes everything that requires speed, throughput, and programmability. That architecture directly targets Bitcoin’s three long-running frictions: slow block times, high fees during congestion, and limited support for complex applications. Because the SVM stack has already proven itself at high throughput and ultra-low latency, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver sub-second performance to wrapped BTC payments, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and even gaming environments, without dragging interactions through 10-minute blocks. A decentralized Canonical Bridge manages BTC flow between layers, while SPL-style token support and Rust tooling make it easier for Solana-native developers to deploy dApps that tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity without learning an entirely new stack. Momentum on the fundraising side has been strong. The presale has now raised more than $28.1M, placing it among the larger early-stage Bitcoin L2 launches, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305. Recent on-chain activity shows four whale wallets accumulating roughly $532K, including a $53K single purchase, a sign of early conviction from size-on-chain buyers. Those looking to position early can explore how to buy $HYPER, while long-term analysts may want to revisit the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to understand where the project could sit if demand for scalable BTC layers continues to build. Join the $HYPER presale now. If Bitcoin Hyper is a bet on Bitcoin becoming a high-performance settlement engine, Best Wallet is a bet on controlling the front door that users walk through to access that ecosystem. Its pitch is bold: capture a massive share of the wallet market by the end of 2026 by merging security, presale access, liquidity routing, and a smoother user experience into a single interface. The stack behind it is surprisingly serious. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP architecture at the wallet layer, the same institutional-grade key management used by major exchanges, then layers on portfolio analytics, presale discovery, and Rubic-powered DEX aggregation. In a market where users hop between Bitcoin L2s, Ethereum rollups, Solana, and Base within the same session, routing matters. If a wallet controls where swaps, bridges, and presale entries originate, its native token can effectively tax that flow via fee rebates, yield boosts, or future governance over routing paths. Traction has also been strong. The Best Wallet presale has raised $17.22M+ so far, with tokens currently priced around $0.025975. Staking utilizes a dynamic APY model (currently 76%), adjusting rewards based on demand, lock durations, and liquidity conditions. This mechanism is designed to prevent runaway emissions and keep incentives responsive as volumes shift. If the next cycle brings another wave of retail onboarding as Bitcoin pushes toward or past its highs, the wallets that sit closest to user intent become some of the most leveraged positions in the ecosystem, and Best Wallet is aiming directly at that layer. For traders mapping out the potential upside, our Best Wallet token price prediction offers useful context on how its market share ambitions could translate into value. Explore Best Wallet’s roadmap and presale details. SPX6900 ($SPX) lives on the far end of the spectrum: a meme-driven ERC-20 that blends parody, market cynicism, and pure speculative energy into a single ticker. It primarily runs on Ethereum but extends across Solana and Base via Wormhole, providing multichain liquidity and cross-community reach. Circulating supply sits near 930M SPX, supported by deflationary burn mechanics that lean into the “engineered scarcity” meme. The token’s breakout moment came in early 2024 when it briefly crossed the $1.5B market-cap milestone before cooling toward the mid-hundreds of millions, still enough to hover near the top-100 bracket and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established meme heavyweights.] Its culture centers on satire, speed, and collective in-jokes rather than utility, but that’s precisely why traders watch it. In risk-on windows, especially when AI stocks rip or Bitcoin reclaims momentum, SPX tends to act as a volatility amplifier. Liquidity often rotates from majors into meme assets with cross-chain presence, and SPX’s ties to Project AEON NFTs give it extra surface area for speculative flows. Track SPX6900 across major exchanges and analytics dashboards. Explore Bitcoin Hyper now.

Title: In the Wake of the U.S. November Elections and the Reopening of Government? Food Insecurity, Worsening Economic and Social Crisis
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/elections-reopening-government-social-crisis-worsen/5906324
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:29:54Z
Full Content:
On November 4, the electorate in several United States municipalities and gubernatorial races delivered a resounding rebuke to the current trajectory of the MAGA Republicans who control both Houses of Congress and the White House. The elections came just over two weeks after the second “No Kings Day” around the U.S. which mobilized an estimated 7 million people. Therefore, on electoral and mass levels people are expressing their disagreement and anger with policy imperatives of the current administration. During the months of October and early November, the U.S. Senate could not agree on a national budget to keep the federal government functioning. The major issue stalling an agreement was the threat on the part of the administration and its allies in Congress to not provide adequate funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was passed during the tenure of former President Barack Obama. Although the ACA has never been a viable substitute for a genuine national insurance program which would guarantee healthcare to all persons living in the country, the dissolution of what is labelled pejoratively as “Obamacare” absent of an alternative would of course prove disastrous. These cuts in healthcare funding, which delayed the reopening of the federal government for 43 days, resulted in the refusal of the administration to provide billions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Agriculture Program (SNAP) benefits to tens of millions of people. It would take a federal court decision demanding that the Trump administration pay out benefits to families which rely on these programs for a bare minimum of food to compel partial payments. Some states in the U.S. recognizing the potential for severe malnourishment, did release emergency funds to stave off a major food deficit crisis. . . Yet the crises are by no means resolved. Although the Republicans in the Senate pledged to reopen a debate on the extension of existing ACA subsidies, there is no methodology for holding them accountable. If the costs of healthcare premiums for ACA recipients increase substantially, it could very well portend the demise of the program since those within low-and-moderate income households would not be able to afford enrollments in this program. In addition to threats to the existence of the ACA, there is currently a bill under consideration in Congress which would place two-year limits, with some exceptions, on Section 8 housing subsidies. If these plans are carried out it would result in homelessness for millions more in the U.S. Consequently, the suspension of SNAP benefits, the overpricing for healthcare coverage and the severe curtailment of housing subsidies would inevitably result in the premature deaths of millions in the U.S. One commentator over the conservative Fox News network said on air that people who have no homes to live in should be given lethal injections by the government. These developments had a profound impact on mass mobilizations against Trump as well as the outcomes of the November 4 elections. The emerging crises requires an independent strategy to build a sustainable resistance movement to not only stop the ongoing attacks from the White House and Congress, the struggle must move to enhance the social safety net and improve the overall economic conditions for the workers, farmers and youth inside the U.S. One of the most watched elections during early November was the mayoral race in New York City, the largest municipality in the country. Zohran Mamdani won the election as a stated democratic socialist committed to lowering the cost of housing, public transportation and childcare. Mamdani emphasized that the municipality was a “city of immigrants” and therefore should not cooperate with efforts by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents to hunt down and deport residents of New York. During the days leading up to the elections, ICE personnel attacked vendors on Canal Street in Manhattan who are there daily merely to make a living amid rising inflation. People in the neighborhood battled the federal agents demonstrating their opposition to the immigration policies of the White House. In other elections where Democratic candidates won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, undoubtedly were the voters’ response to the presence of ICE and the worsening economic situation facing working people. In California, a referendum to create five new Congressional districts was a direct response to the actions of the Texas state legislature to enhance the membership of the MAGA Republican representation in the House of Representatives. Los Angeles, the second largest municipality in the U.S., has been targeted by the Trump administration by deploying large units of ICE agents along with federalized National Guard troops and Marines. These efforts by Trump have not endeared people in California and other states to his domestic policies. In Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., the deployment of the National Guard was carried out absent any support for these actions by the people. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago have taken legal and political actions to prevent the sending of National Guard troops into the third-largest city in the country. On a daily basis people in Chicago and its suburbs have been challenging ICE in their raids on communities, workplaces and commercial businesses. Portland, Oregon, which is not a majority African American or Latin American municipality, has also been targeted in all likelihood for its progressive population which fought the deployment of federal agents during the George Floyd uprising of 2020. On a legal basis and through mass demonstrations, the people of Portland strongly objected to the sending of National Guard troops into the city. Although Trump declared that ICE, the Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) agents and the National Guard are being deployed to find, detain and deport migrants, in actuality his security personnel have stated that they are after “gangs” and drug traffickers. These agents are setting up checkpoints to monitor the populations as a whole. Despite the claim of economic prosperity over the last ten months, untold numbers of workers, farmers, agricultural employees, small and medium-sized businesses are suffering immensely due to the repressive apparatus of the state. Many people are afraid to go to work while others cannot patronize businesses due to cutbacks in services. Large transnational corporations are being impacted as well with layoffs in the auto industry, delivery services and hospitality sectors. Sonder corporation after ending its partnership with Marriot International, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Amazon, UPS, Verizon and others have announced the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees. These layoffs will compound the problem of joblessness brought about by the massive downsizing within the federal government since the Trump administration came to power. During the campaign for president in 2024, Trump claimed that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After 10 months, the war rages on with Russian Federation troops now surrounding Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Sanctions against the Russian Federation and continuing weapons supplies from the U.S., UK and the European Union (EU) have failed to turn the tide of the war. Many other false statements related to ending the war in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have further exposed the ineffectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. The forced migration to at least five African states continues to prompt protests and legal actions in the U.S. and in at least one country on the continent. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is threatened with wider military assaults. Dozens have been executed extrajudicially by the Pentagon under the guise of fighting illegal drug smuggling into the U.S. In response, the government of President Nicholas Maduro has mobilized over 5 million people to resist any attempted land invasion. In Palestine people are still being killed, displaced, denied food and medical services weeks after a ceasefire was declared. Trump’s meeting with the Saudi monarchy will not benefit the workers and oppressed peoples in the U.S. and West Asia. These domestic and foreign initiatives by the U.S. administration are not reflective of growing strength among the imperialist states. It is a clear signal of a political quagmire and economic decline of Washington, Wall Street and its allies around the world. Therefore, the resistance movement to the Trump administration must seek allies broadly inside the U.S. as well as internationally. This global alliance of progressive and revolutionary forces provides the only method for the reversal of the present period of reaction. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: The lonely AI bear: Why one analyst just took the brave step of downgrading Amazon and Microsoft

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week. Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft. In a note to clients this week, Haissl downgraded the firm's rating on the tech giants despite the ongoing hype for generative AI and the billions both firms have pledged to spend on the new tech in the coming years. Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as "as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied," Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s. But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said. "We downgrade Amazon and Microsoft with a heavy heart," Haissl wrote, noting that the firm had held a bullish view on the two stocks for the last several years. "But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable," he added. There are key differences between the business model for "cloud 1.0" and generative AI, Haissl said. For one, AI is far more costly. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power. It's also believed to generate less revenue. Each GPU generates around $10 billion of revenue per gigawatt, per the firm's calculations. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements. "We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. The real constraint is the capex required relative to the growth delivered," Haissl said, later adding that he believed the market was overestimating the returns related to AI investment. Second, AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn "value destructive," according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips. Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups. "Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further," he said. Amazon and Microsoft already look like they're "re-rated meaningfully" in price, Haissl said, pointing to the recent declines in both stocks. Amazon shares are down around 13% from their peak in early November, while Microsoft shares are down 10% from their peak in late October. "While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth," Haissl said. That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's hard to hash out a bear case for the near-term for these stocks, Haissl wrote, adding that the firm believed both would continue to post strong growth figures over the next year. "In our view, it is not a bear case — but it is no longer a bull case either," he said, adding that the firm would need to see high growth and a "meaningful reduction in capex" in order to turn more optimistic. It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down 6% from its high in late October. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven tech titans at the heart of the AI trade, is down 7% from its peak last month. Jump to

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in because markets are moving, and not in small ways. What started as another busy week of earnings and economic data has quickly changed into something more significant. Somewhere between Nvidia’s eye-popping numbers and JPMorgan’s latest call, traders are suddenly talking about an “everything rally,” and even Bitcoin miners are waking up to the buzz. JPMorgan’s trading desk forecasts an “everything rally” after Nvidia exceeded expectations with $57 billion in quarterly revenue and a $65 billion guidance, triggering a 5% after-hours surge and adding over $200 billion to the chipmaker’s market value. Nvidia’s impressive earnings report bolstered belief in the AI investment cycle. Gains spread across chipmakers, and Bitcoin rose above $91,000, with risk appetite returning to markets after a multi-day slide. Nvidia projected an even stronger fourth quarter, guiding revenue to $65 billion versus the $62 billion anticipated by analysts. Nvidia’s upbeat report sparked gains in other chipmakers. AMD, Micron, Broadcom, and Intel all climbed in after-hours trading, reflecting optimism for the semiconductor sector. The results reinforced investor confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track despite recent volatility. After the S&P 500 Index fell 3.4% over four days, JPMorgan’s trading desk issued a bullish note. Andrew Tyler reiterated a dip-buying stance, emphasizing stable fundamentals and stating the investment thesis is not reliant on Federal Reserve policy shifts. The bank highlighted Nvidia earnings and the September nonfarm payrolls report as major catalysts for potential new market highs. SETUP POISED FOR AN "EVERYTHING RALLY"JPMORGAN TRADING DESK:"Given that there have not been any changes to the fundamental story, nor does our investment hypothesis rely on the Fed easing, we are dip-buyers.

The investment bank stated that hedge funds have de-risked, while discretionary investors remain underweight and are poised to deploy capital. November has been the S&P 500’s weakest month since 2008, with a 3% decline month-to-date. Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher Mining, IREN, and Hut 8 leapt in pre-market trading after Nvidia’s strong guidance. The surge reflected growing acknowledgment of miners’ expanding role in AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. Nonetheless, institutional investors, including Peter Thiel and SoftBank, have recently trimmed their holdings in Nvidia and major AI companies, signaling wariness over high valuations.

Title: Walmart raises sales outlook, boosted by e-commerce and higher-income shoppers

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Shoppers are still flocking to Walmart. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook Thursday, heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Walmart also offered fresh signs that it is shedding its original identity as a strictly down-market brick-and-mortar operation by growing its e-commerce business and increasing its market share of higher-income shoppers. Walmart's shares closed more than 6% higher Thursday, even as the broader market suffered a dramatic sell-off. The stock is up more than 18% this year. The biggest retailer and grocer in the United States acknowledged the added financial pressures on lower-income households but said middle-income families are holding up. Walmart saw more sales growth in its grocery and health and wellness product categories than in general merchandise. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on a call with analysts Thursday morning. The company reported that same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the quarter that ended Oct. 31, exceeding analysts’ expectations. “The team delivered another strong quarter across the business. eCommerce was a bright spot again this quarter. We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart reported 27% growth in e-commerce sales globally. Walmart also announced that it will move from trading on the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq next month. It’s the latest sign of America's largest private employer working to position itself as tech-forward in order to compete with Amazon. The discounter's third-quarter earnings come amid growing questions about whether Americans contending with tariffs, corporate layoffs and accelerating inflation are still confidently spending on retail. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence, Walmart’s strong earnings and guidance indicate that consumers are still shopping — at least at the lower end of the retail price point. The company announced last week that McMillon will step down in January. McMillon, 59, started at Walmart as an associate in the 1980s and has helmed the company since 2014. Under his leadership, Walmart improved pay and benefits for many employees, renovated hundreds of stores and boosted its e-commerce and delivery programs, especially during the Covid pandemic. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job Feb. 1. Since 2019, Furner has led Walmart's American operations — by far the largest slice of the company, with around 1.6 million of Walmart's approximately 2.1 million total associates worldwide. Walmart is leading the retail race against longtime rival Target, which Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter sales and cut its full-year profit guidance. Target’s sales have faltered over the last few years, with some consumers expressing frustration over what they said were disorganized stores and rollbacks of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In October, Target said it would cut about 1,800 corporate jobs. Target is hoping for a fresh start in the new year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke will take over Feb. 1, the same day Furner becomes CEO of Walmart. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it plans to increase its investment in stores and technology next year by 25%. Since January, U.S. businesses have had to contend with ever-changing tariffs under the Trump administration. Walmart has navigated the uncertainty by raising prices on some items, while swallowing some tariff costs on others. In the three months that ended Oct. 31, prices at Walmart U.S. rose around 1% overall, with higher prices on electronics, toys and seasonal items in particular due to tariff pressures. In the grocery section, Walmart expects egg prices to drop but anticipates the record-breaking beef prices will stay high, in part from cattle herds shrinking over the last few decades. Prices for other grocery staples are also up, though the Trump administration's rollback of tariffs on many food items last week could offer some relief. Despite the rising prices, Walmart is offering its annual Thanksgiving menu deal for 10 at less than $4 per person. It's less expensive than last year's package, but it also contains fewer items. The company is also expanding its use of artificial intelligence, teaming up with OpenAI to allow customers to buy from Walmart within ChatGPT. Walmart has not detailed the terms of the partnership or shared when the new option could be available. This week, Target announced its own collaboration with OpenAI. Walmart has lagged behind rival Amazon in AI-driven e-commerce — Amazon debuted its Rufus shopping assistant in February 2024, more than a year before Walmart launched its counterpart, Sparky.

Title: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmine-3-7b-ether-loss-dat-hotel-california-blackrock-staked-eth-etf

BitMine’s $3.7 billion paper loss and the falling mNAV valuations are threatening the business model of DATs, according to 10x Research. Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether (ETH) holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows The mNAV ratio compares a company’s enterprise value to the value of its crypto holdings. An mNAV above 1 allows a company to raise funds by issuing new shares to accumulate digital assets. Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. BitMine’s basic mNAV stood at 0.77 while its diluted mNAV stood at 0.92, according to data from Bitminetracker. BitMine holds about 3.56 million ETH valued at roughly $10.7 billion, representing 2.94% of the total Ether supply. The firm’s average cost basis is $4,051 per ETH. Other DATs also suffered a sharp decrease in their mNAVs, including Strategy, Bitmine, Metaplanet, Sharplink Gaming, Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. Related: Strategy rides out Bitcoin crash, still on track for S&P 500 spot: Matrixport BlackRock has registered a new staked Ether ETF offering in Delaware, marking the first step for the $13.5 trillion asset management giant’s diversification into Ethereum-based products, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. BlackRock’s proposed Ether staking ETF could offer another low-cost, yield-generating fund, without the hidden costs associated with traditional treasury firms. This development may threaten the economics of DATs, according to 10x Research. “With BlackRock now seeking approval to stake ETH in its ETF, offering a low-cost source of yield, the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny,” the research report states. More investors may start reallocating toward a potential staked Ether fund from BlackRock when they realize that the 0.25% management fee is far smaller compared to the embedded costs of DATs, according to 10X. Asset managers REX-Osprey and Grayscale have already launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October.

It’s getting frothy out there. Pick any stock market metric, whether it’s the Nasdaq’s closing price or a more technical measure like the Shiller P/E ratio, and the number will look unusually large. Throw in crazy AI valuations, for privately held startups and publicly traded stocks alike, and what we’re seeing looks a lot like a bubble. Perhaps this time is different. But note that phrase served as the ironic title of an acclaimed 2011 book by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff—a work whose subtitle is “Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.” In any case, if you’re one of many looking at your swollen portfolio with a mix of glee and dread, it may be time to consider a rebalancing act. This section of this year’s Investor’s Guide offers some ideas on how to go about that. We offer tips on how to play defense in the current stock market (spoiler: Candymakers are a sweet bet for sour times). We also devote some space to stocks that might be best held at arm’s length; whatever these companies’ ultimate fates might be, these aren’t the times or the prices at which to be a buyer. And for optimists, we have a preview of some buzzy rumored IPOs coming next year. Choppy markets can make for attractively priced debuts: Perhaps you will find the next UPS, which went public right before the dotcom bust, or Visa, which listed on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis. We’ll also weigh in on gold and Bitcoin. In the wake of Warren Buffett penning his final letter to investors, it feels fitting to say his most famous adage applies like never before: Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at investment manager Research Affiliates, says a good first step is to diversify beyond stocks to TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) or commodities like gold. When it comes to equities, Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard chief economist in the Americas, advises embracing value stocks—stocks whose prices are low relative to their earnings. Not all value stocks are created equal, of course. Here are some categories and names to consider that are likely to fare well in an economic downturn (prices are as of market close Nov. 13): Consumer plays:Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at financial services firm Morningstar, says companies that produce staples like food and cleaning products are less correlated with broader economic trends. Stocks in this “consumer defensive” category include Colgate-Palmolive (CL, $79), which makes toothpaste and other household items. In addition to selling goods that consumers will buy in any economy, “Colgate is unique in the fact that they are very globally diversified,” says Erin Lash, Morningstar’s director of consumer equity research. Lash is also a fan of Mondelez International (MDLZ, $57), a candy, food, and beverage company, in part because it derives more than 70% of its revenue outside North America. “Confectionery in particular remains an affordable indulgence for consumers,” she says. You’ve still got your health: Stocks in the health care sector, another recession-resistant industry, are another way to buffer your portfolio from market shocks. David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, likes HCA Healthcare (HCA,$473), which operates around 190 hospitals and 150 other health care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. “Demand for health care is going up like crazy,” says Trainer, adding that this trend, combined with HCA’s more-than-decade-long history of notching consistent profits, makes it a strong, undervalued play. Energy hogs: Once-boring energy stocks became buzzy owing to the AI sector’s insatiable need for power, which has produced record-high electricity demand. But even if the AI boom goes south, energy businesses aren’t as risky as they seem, says Masturzo of Research Affiliates, because overall demand for power remains strong. MPLX (MPLX, $52) is an Ohio company that owns oil pipelines and fuel transportation facilities. “As long as people need energy, they’re going to transport it,” says Trainer. Its price/earnings ratio in mid-November was 11, much lower than the average of 31 among the S&P 500. “Anti-AI”: Arnott, the strategist at Morningstar, says that if investors are worried about the overvaluation of AI stocks, they could look to Buffett. The business legend’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $513) is a conglomerate that Arnott describes as “an anti-AI play.” The firm derives much of its income from sectors like energy, railroads, and insurance—services that will be very much in demand even if the AI bull market turns bearish. In a frothy market all stocks are risky— and that’s doubly true for companies that may have soared too high in the recent boom, or that face harsh economic headwinds. Here are candidates to avoid, at least until business conditions revive or their prices come down to earth. Circle (CRCL, $82) went public this summer in one of the most successful IPOs in history. That was then; now, the crypto firm is struggling to hold its value as interest rates, which directly impact Circle’s stablecoin revenue, are poised to decline. Circle’s share price is facing further pressure from the end of a lockup period for employee stock sales, and its ongoing struggle to control expenses. Tesla (TSLA, $402) is on pace to record its worst year of profits since 2021. It’s also headed for a second straight year of shrinking sales in its car business. Still, the stock is trading at all-time highs. Why? Investors are likely betting that CEO Elon Musk will deliver on moonshot promises of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Maybe Musk is worth his recently won $1 trillion pay package, but the likelihood of Tesla turbocharging its car sales in 2026 to match its current valuation seems out of this world. Bears are sounding the alarm over inflated valuations for AI companies, and there’s perhaps no purer publicly traded AI play than CoreWeave (CRWV, $78). The company operates data centers across the U.S. and sells computing capacity to Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. CoreWeave “is the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble,” Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm shorting the company’s stock, wrote in September. The core of CoreWeave’s risk lies with its liabilities: To finance the construction of its data centers, it has incurred billions in debt and taken on hefty lease obligations. Can it juice its revenue to outpace that tsunami of liabilities? Two words: prediction markets. That describes the business of upstarts Kalshi and Polymarket, which made their names offering odds on U.S. politics, but are fast expanding to other categories—including sports betting. This has left DraftKings (DKNG, $30) one of the most popular online sportsbooks, on its back foot. “Analysts are downplaying the tectonic shift that we believe is occurring in the sports betting market and DKNG,” wrote short-seller Spruce Point Capital Management in an October report. After President Trump unveiled a sweeping set of tariffs on what he termed “Liberation Day,” swaths of companies saw their share prices tumble. Many have since recovered, but Deere (DE, $473), the venerable maker of John Deere agricultural and construction machinery, has continued to struggle. For the first three quarters of 2025, the company reported year-over-year decreases in net sales, and it’s been wrestling with the impact as trade wars play havoc with American farm exports—not a good sign for tractor sales. If 2024 amounted to an IPO drought, the 2025 IPO market has been more like a persistent drizzle. That, more or less, bodes well for an even steadier stream of public debuts in 2026. “The IPO market is not closed,” says Merritt Hummer, partner at Bain Capital Ventures. “It’s just curated, and I think that’ll continue to be the case. That cautious but decidedly positive sentiment is a bigger deal than it may appear on the surface. After IPOs soared in 2021 amid near-zero interest rates and stay-athome investor mania, the past few years have been muted. According to Dealogic, there were 1,010 IPOs in the U.S. in 2021, including marquee brands like Rivian, Bumble, and Robinhood. Over the next three years, however, the market collectively mustered only 546 more public offerings, with just a handful of big names in the mix. Then came 2025, which through Q3 has seen more than 300 U.S. IPOs, including blockbuster debuts from CoreWeave, Circle, and Figma. It was a decent but not great year in the view of market watchers, but they’re bullish on 2026. “Everything is set up for a much more positive year, because multiples are still pretty strong for tech in the public markets,” says Kyle Stanford, PitchBook director of research for U.S. venture capital. Geopolitical instability has fueled post-2021 stagnation in the IPO market, as have higher interest rates. But that stagnation means the bench for potential venture-backed IPOs runs deep with companies that have been biding their time. There are obvious giants waiting in the 2026 wings, the most notable of which is Databricks, a cloud platform for AI and data analytics valued north of $100 billion. Long discussed as an inevitable public company, Databricks has a key advantage that will be essential for any company looking to go public at a premium: an AI angle. “Anything with an AI story is getting a premium,” says Mary D’Onofrio, Crosslink Capital partner. “Databricks, for example, had $4 billion of run rate revenue, and AI products were providing $1 billion of it…Anything that can touch on AI, which tugs on the purse strings and the willingness to buy of customers, suggests ongoing growth.” This is equally true for other names attracting IPO buzz, including Canva, which in 2024 acquired Leonardo.ai, leveraging the startup to launch new AI-flavored products. (The successful IPO of fellow design unicorn Figma is being cited as evidence of Canva’s readiness.) There’s also Deel, an HR platform valued at around $17 billion, which makes its AI case by investing in automation. (Notably, none of these companies are making the kinds of massive infrastructure investments that have some industry watchers worried about an AI bubble.) All this AI talk evokes the question: What about OpenAI? It’s not impossible, but most watchers think OpenAI won’t take the leap into public markets until 2027. Meanwhile, the most underrated IPO story of 2026 could very well be fintech. This year saw the likes of Chime, Klarna, and Circle go public, and unicorns like Plaid and Rapyd are rumored to be waiting in the wings. “Chime and Circle showed that fintechs with clear profitability paths can perform well, and that gave the market confidence again,” says Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures general partner and early Chime investor. “‘Profitability’ wasn’t a word anyone was using in the 2012 to 2019 runup. And now it’s the most important term we talk about and are thinking about for next year.” Others tech firms to watch out for: cybersecurity company 1Password, fleet management software provider Motive, and fitness tracking app Strava. But a word of caution: A host of factors could rain on this parade. PitchBook’s Stanford doesn’t expect a recession, but says that if one materialized it would stymie the IPO pipeline. And then there are the unpredictable dynamics of the AI boom. David Chen, Morgan Stanley’s head of global technology investment banking, thinks much of the current hype will create serious long-term value. But not every AI-fueled rise will live up to that hype. “It kind of reminds me of when I started in this industry in 1999,” Chen says. “If expectations aren’t met…you’ll have a lessening of interest temporarily, which always happens in tech. There are always winners and losers.” Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven in times of economic trouble. But these days, a growing number of market watchers say investors should opt instead for digital gold—a popular nickname for Bitcoin. Owing to the rules governing its creation, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation, which is a big reason fans say it should be treated as a permanent store of value, just like the famous yellow metal. “It’s the only place you can go that’s independent from government inflation,” says David Pakman, a managing partner at the venture capital firm CoinFund. “It’s the kind of asset you’ll hand down to your kids—you must own it.” It’s clear many people agree with Pakman, based on Bitcoin hitting a record-high price of around $125,000 in October, and seeing its market cap swell to over $2 trillion. The World Gold Council and prominent goldbugs, who used to ignore Bitcoin, now regularly denounce it, recognizing competition. Does this mean gold’s days as the safest of assets are numbered? Hardly. As of November, Bitcoin’s market cap was only around 7% of the total value of all above-ground gold. What’s more, gold has been on an unprecedented tear this year, hitting $3,000 an ounce for the first time in March, and $4,000 less than six months later. The eye-popping runs have left goldbugs and Bitcoin believers ecstatic. But Mike McGlone, a senior commodities strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence, says he is experiencing a different emotion. He describes himself as “frightened” by the soaring prices of numerous commodities, including gold, and believes a major correction is coming that could see the price of the yellow metal drop 25% or more. McGlone says he is especially skeptical of Bitcoin’s trajectory after attending an investing summit in Naples where he witnessed people stand and clap whenever someone mentioned the cryptocurrency. “This is classic peak market stuff,” he warned, predicting that Bitcoin could fall to around $50,000 in the coming year. Indeed, there are signs that the crypto rally, fueled by the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and the Trump administration’s favorable regulatory policies, is running out of gas. In early November, the currency dipped below the $100,000 mark and has since floated closer to that level than to its all-time high. Pakman, though, is taking the long view. “It’s just the greatest asset ever created,” he said. “Bitcoin has performed better than any asset over 11 of the last 14 years. —Jeff John Roberts This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “What to buy, and not buy, in 2026.”

Title: Long-delayed jobs report to show hiring amid wobbly economy
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/long-delayed-jobs-report-show-hiring-amid-wobbly/story?id=127668400

The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as "stagflation." Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. “We have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. "A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it," Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

RTÉ Sport journalist Ice baths have become common place in the routine of a GAA player before and after a big match, but 30-odd Amsterdam hurlers might be taking it to the extreme as they get set to leap into the Herengracht Canal ahead of the biggest ever game for the club – a Leinster Special Club Junior final against Longford Slashers on Saturday. On 17 March, 2003, as Gary Hanniffy was lifting the Tommy Moore Cup as Birr defeated Dunloy in the All-Ireland final, seeds were being sown 750km east as the Amsterdam GAA club was formed on a chilly St Patrick's Day in the Netherlands. History was made at Croke Park that day as Birr became the first four-time All-Ireland winners, moving clear of Cork’s Blackrock and Galway’s Athenry, and 22 years later it’s Amsterdam who have made a bit of history by becoming the first mainland European team to reach a Leinster final. The special club tournament – essentially a Junior B grade – was first run in 2007 and won by Offaly’s Kullrin, before their amalgamation with Killeigh to form Clodiagh Gaels, and the prize on offer, by coincidence, was a trip to the Netherlands with a match scheduled against a European selection in the Hague. It ran until 2015 before being placed on hiatus until its return this year - and this weekend, a crowd of club members will gather in Mulligan’s Irish Bar in the Dutch city to watch the final while for the second time in a number of weeks, the panel will make the trip to Ireland. Earlier this month, the side travelled to Ashbourne and faced Meath IHC finalists Rathmolyon. Five points down at the break, and four behind with just 10 minutes left, the four-in-a-row European champions fought back down the stretch and fittingly it was Galway’s Grahame McDermott who moved them ahead for only the second time in the contest with a penalty in the 63rd minute with their player-manager, Limerick’s Dara O’Farrell, putting the seal on a famous 1-13 to 1-11 win. They’re off to Glennon Brothers Pearse Park for the final against Robbie Stakelum’s Slashers, who won their county’s senior title this year with a win over Wolfe Tone's and defeated Wicklow’s Aughrim in the other Leinster semi-final. With history already made, the hope is they can add some more, but whatever the outcome, it’s going to be a day to remember for club chairperson Eimear Lafferty. A member of the famed Gormley clan in Tyrone – her aunt Eilish is one of the best ladies players in Ulster history - Lafferty was always likely to find her way to the GAA club when landing in 'Mokum’ four years ago. It only took hours in the end, the player heading to training on the very same evening she arrived. She still plays with them, helps with the management too and, of course, chairs a committee that is completely player-led. "We’re a long-established club, but we seem to be growing year-on-year," said Lafferty. "For a number of years, the ladies' team was an amalgamation of teams from the Benelux region (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) but we’re lucky enough now to have the numbers for our own team. "We’re quite lucky with our facilities, it’s outside the city but with the bike culture, we can all cycle there – it's about a 45-minute cycle each way for me. "The biggest challenge for us is that we are an entirely player-run club. A lot of the European clubs don’t have that older generation to turn to who did a lot of that managing in terms of the logistics of the club. "It is difficult to separate those roles when you’re still a player, but we’ve worked really hard on it. "In the last couple of years we have established a camogie team and they won their first tournament this year, we’re building our youth team – we hosted Cúl Camps last year and the European Féile this year – and we’ve also set up a handball team this year; I suppose you could call us a fully-fledged GAA club for the first time. "It’s certainly given myself and the committee members a deeper appreciation of all the work our Irish clubs carry out to keep us playing and invested in the sport we grew up with - particularly my home club, Aodh Ruadh, now Thomas Clarke’s, which was founded by inspirational and dedicated women of the GAA that had to push and campaign to have their voices heard, and to become a successful club." Two trips to Ireland in a fortnight is what the club wanted, but it brings with it a serious financial burden. That’s where the dip in the canal comes in with a Go Fund Me campaign promising a series of forfeits for each milestone met, with players set to shave heads, perform a song in the middle of Dam Square and – for a target long since reached – jump as a group into water in their full club kit. The city is set for a temperature high of 6 degrees this week, according to forecasts, so it’s cash well earned. "It’ll cost about €500, €600 to send each player over to Ireland and we have a panel of 30," Lafferty continued. "We’re lucky the lads are happy to do all these challenges. There’s maybe a few girlfriends unhappy with all these shaved heads and shaved moustaches, but we’re very good at pulling together as a club. "You can take being player-run as a negative as there is that extra pressure, but it does mean that everyone who is involved is really dedicated and wants to see the club flourish and thrive." It's an all-Irish squad travelling to Longford, although the club has - and continues to - attract players from both the Netherlands and a number of nations. 'Big' Thom Verweijen has played a key role in midfield at times for the hurler while the club's female teams in particular attract players from various nations. It adds another layer of pride for all involved with the club. That pride will be on display at Pearse Park. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: September jobs report arrives today, almost seven weeks behind schedule

Scott Horsley Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An overdue report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%. The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December. While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall. The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months. Loading... For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling. "Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode," Waller told a group of economists in London this week. Business leaders, he said, are "starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future." Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers. Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But minutes from the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers. Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year. Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting. But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. "You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door," Waller said. "And then these firms are not going to be hiring." While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios. The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs. The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring. Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come. "There's definitely a reduction of supply," he said. "But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The September jobs report is finally here

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The United States added 119,000 jobs in September, a stronger-than-expected figure and a sign that the economy was adding jobs at a healthy clip before government shutdown. But the details of the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a more mixed picture, that of a labor market that has recently begun to look wobblier amid high-profile layoff announcements from a host of blue-chip companies. September's employment gains were concentrated in health care, food and drinking establishments, and social assistance. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, though the pickup was due in part to an increase in the labor force, which the BLS said gained 450,000 new potential workers. The pace of wage growth slowed. Thursday’s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the BLS said Wednesday. The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market. But data from private and alternative sources has painted a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and stubborn price increases. Over the past few weeks, Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS have announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Their ranks were joined Thursday by Verizon, which announced the start of layoffs affecting 13,000, according to an internal memo. About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve — a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis. A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions. Whatever the exact total, those who do find themselves without work are now experiencing an average unemployment spell of 24.5 weeks — nearly six months. That’s the worst reading since November 2017. Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring. And what companies are still hiring are offering lower compensation rates that more experienced workers may have trouble accepting. The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said. Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a “post and pray” job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach. A bright spot has been local government, Price said — something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in. “It’s a weird market,” she said. Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration. “My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,” he said. In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable. The Fed’s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. “Most participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further” interest-rate cuts “could add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,” the notes said. So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires. “Fears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week.

Title: Can We Blame Private Equity for Everything?

The Blackstone Group offices in New York, 2013. The 2010s were, among other things, the decade of private equity. A segment of the finance sector long shrouded in myth and controversy, private equity is at its core a straightforward business: A firm raises money from clients (such as pension funds) and uses it to buy businesses and other assets (such as real estate), usually adding a large chunk of borrowed money to the mix. The PE firm aims to increase the value of the acquired assets and then sell them at a profit. Clients receive whatever is left of any gains after the deduction of fees, which include a share of those gains. The “equity” in private equity refers to the ownership stakes the PE firm takes, while the “private” means these investments are held outside of public stock markets. Though private equity has been around since the 1970s, its growth went into overdrive after the global financial crisis of 2007–09. Until that point, banks—especially investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan—had been the most powerful players in the world of global finance. Yet banks were widely held responsible for the crisis, leading regulators in the United States and a host of other countries to clip their wings. As big banks became “more heavily regulated and scrutinized,” Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2019, private-equity firms like Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR moved decisively out of their shadow. “Almost everything that’s happened since 2008 has tilted in [private equity’s] favor. Low interest rates to finance deals? Check. A friendly political climate? Check. A long line of clients? Check…. Private equity managers,” the Bloomberg Businessweek report concluded, “won the financial crisis.” By 2021, the average Blackstone employee was earning more than $2 million per annum, and the firm’s CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, had a net worth of nearly $40 billion. It is thus little wonder that recent years have seen a slew of books aimed at coming to grips with the PE phenomenon, with more in the works. The latest addition to the crop is Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream, by the journalist Megan Greenwell. Although there have been notable exceptions—including two memoirs about working in private equity, from very different perspectives—most of the recent books, as Greenwell points out, have been attempts to understand and evaluate PE in broad terms as an economic and social phenomenon: what it is, how it operates, its size and structure, and so forth. Such books focus, Greenwell observes, “on the macro level: the number of companies that shutter, the number of jobs that disappear, the number of dollars that are won and lost.” In Bad Company, Greenwell takes a different tack, shifting the lens from the macro to the micro level. “When we talk about how private equity affects communities,” she writes, “we’re really talking about how it affects people, the individuals who have no choice but to rely on firms for their jobs, their homes, their essential services.” And so she presents us with the stories of four individuals whose lives have been impacted by the PE takeover of, respectively, a retail chain, a small-town hospital, a newspaper company, and an apartment complex. Through these profiles, Greenwell paints a picture of a decidedly unedifying phenomenon: of PE firms swooping into local communities, buying local assets, and radically degrading the conditions of people’s lives. But does this analytical shift from the macro to the micro scale ultimately pay dividends for our understanding of the nature and effects of the PE business? There are, of course, always different ways to tell a story, and the story of private equity is no different in this respect. However, when the mode of analysis is the exploration of individual lives, as it is in Bad Company, it’s important to think closely about what those lives can and cannot meaningfully tell us about the wider phenomenon under consideration. When books that explore broad social phenomena through individuals’ life stories work particularly well, there is usually an intimate and necessary connection between the lives in question and the phenomenon to which the author is relating them. The sociologist Matthew Desmond’s 2016 book Evicted is a good example. In it, Desmond follows eight individuals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they and their households go through the process of eviction at the hands of their landlords. Focused on these individual lives, Evicted also manages to serve as an exemplary study of the wider phenomenon of eviction because of two key characteristics of the latter. The first is that eviction is precisely something that happens to individuals. The second is that, for tenants, involuntary eviction is a unique hardship: While housing insecurity can take many forms and can be suffered in all sorts of ways, nothing else matches the experience of being evicted from one’s home against one’s wishes. Then what about working for a company or living in an apartment that is taken over by a PE firm? Is that, too, a unique type of experience? Consider Greenwell’s four profiles: Liz is laid off without severance from Toys “R” Us when its PE owners close its last 200 stores; Roger, a doctor, sees his beloved hospital in rural Wyoming stripped of resources and crucial services after a PE takeover; Natalia is a reporter at a local newspaper whose staff is slashed after PE ownership takes hold, diminishing the paper’s capacity to report and hence the community’s access to local news; and Loren moves from public rental housing into a PE-owned apartment complex where mold and infestations of mice and roaches are not allowed to stand in the way of rent hikes. Is there a necessary and intimate connection between these types of personal experience and the phenomenon of private equity, one that makes them “PE experiences” per se? Greenwell maintains that there is indeed such a necessary and intimate connection. For her, the experience of working at a PE-owned business or living in PE-owned housing is special inasmuch as the PE ownership and operation of such assets is itself special. As she sees it, it all comes down to profitability—that is, what ostensibly connects the individuals whose lives Greenwell chronicles, thus making theirs a shared experience as opposed to four unrelated ordeals, is their subjection to a distinctive profit calculus. But is that calculus unique to PE? Early in Bad Company, Greenwell cites the American economist Milton Friedman and his influential 1970 essay about the role of the corporation in American capitalism. “The social responsibility of business,” Friedman famously insisted, “is to increase its profits.” And that, he added, is its sole responsibility. Friedman’s injunction has been endlessly debated in the decades since. For Greenwell, its particular relevance is that private equity, and only private equity, has, in her view, followed the Friedmanite philosophy to the letter. Friedman, she says, “set the stage for the rise of private equity.” To explain how PE differs from other forms of owning and operating assets like businesses and real estate, Greenwell offers the following take: “The definition of success is loftier in the private equity world: not just making profits, but maximizing them.” “Merely making a profit was no longer enough,” she writes, for instance, of what changed when Apollo Global Management took over LifePoint Health and its chain of rural hospitals across the US, including Roger’s hospital in Wyoming. “Now the goal,” à la Friedman, “was to maximize shareholder value.” In positing this Manichaean distinction between “normal” capitalist businesses that “just make” profits and PE firms that seek to “maximize” them, Greenwell establishes a pro forma narrative of what happens when private equity comes to town: “When the only worth of a local grocery store, a newspaper, or a hospital is the short-term profits it can generate, the company becomes little more than a mine awaiting extraction.” Which, crucially, is not what that company had previously been: “Businesses that were once pillars of a society founder and crumble,” Greenwell writes. By this way of thinking, other capitalist businesses, unlike PE firms, do take seriously “responsibilities” other than profit-making. Far be it from me to downplay private equity’s profiteering, but this argument clearly rests on a questionable supposition: Is it genuinely credible to cast non-PE firms as less obsessed with profit? Try telling BlackRock, State Street, or the other major shareholders in America’s 4,000-odd public companies that the goal of those companies is something besides maximizing shareholder value. Greenwell’s own reporting demonstrably belies the distinction her book posits. Take Gannett, the media group that owned the local newspaper employing Natalia when it was acquired by Fortress Investment Group in 2019. Was Gannett formerly a pillar of local society, whose modus operandi was rudely upended by the PE barbarians? Hardly. “Well before private equity was in the local media game,” Greenwell informs us, “Gannett was creating [PE] firms’ playbooks for them: ruthlessly consolidate, centralize as much as possible, boost shareholder value at all costs—even when the cost was the journalism, the company’s ostensible raison d’être.” Gannett, it turns out, was already an archetype of Friedmanite capitalism, red in tooth and claw. The same kind of contradiction befalls the other case studies here. The more Greenwell tells us about the businesses that private equity came in and subsumed, the less like pillars of society and paragons of business ethics they appear to be. Rather than substantiating her thesis of a sui generis role for private equity in destroying civil society and the American dream, what Greenwell actually reaffirms is a kind of bog-standard point about how business is done in America. Because, of course, it wasn’t just private equity that took Friedman’s gospel to heart. Capital at large did. None of this is to say that there aren’t important differences between PE firms and other owners and managers of businesses and real estate—that things do not change when PE comes to town. Very often they do. Nor is it to say that the individual stories that Greenwell spotlights in Bad Company have nothing to tell us about the corrosive effects of a corporate and financial world single-mindedly beholden to maximizing shareholder value. But as insights, in and of themselves, into the nature of the PE phenomenon? Not so much. In reality, much the same book, containing much the same litany of woes, could be written about the effects on individuals and communities of adventures in the capitalist profit imperative that have nothing to do with private equity whatsoever. Indeed, over the years, many such books already have been written, from Michael Harrington’s The Other America to Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed and Jefferson Cowie’s Stayin’ Alive. Does a private-equity takeover often result in dire outcomes for workers and tenants? To be sure. But it is far from being unique in that. It’s for good reason that the other recent books seeking to comprehend and appraise the PE phenomenon are primarily pitched at the macro level. Private equity is a quintessentially macro-scale enterprise; instructive analysis of it cannot eschew that analytical scale. Boiled down to its essence, private equity is an investment phenomenon. Yet if investment is the term we use to refer to the myriad ways in which actors holding surplus capital are connected to the actors who put that capital to work, then private equity represents above all a distinctive way of configuring that connectivity. Arguably, its cardinal characteristic—evident to all institutional stakeholders—is that the investment explicitly does not have an open time horizon. Allocating client capital via funds with fixed lifespans, and returning the capital (ideally with a profit) to clients upon the funds’ termination, PE managers buy assets—and this cannot be emphasized enough—in order to later sell them. Whether the acquired businesses or rental homes or whatever else it may be are held for one year, three, or five, everything that the PE manager does with those assets while they are under its control is done with a view specifically to maximize the price at exit. If there is a single thing that one must grasp in order to understand private equity, this is it. Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers John Nichols Column / Chris Lehmann Sasha Abramsky Bad Company, to be clear, does not eschew macro-scale analysis altogether. Greenwell has plenty to say about the role of debt financing in PE buyouts; the relationship of PE firms to their clients in the institutional-investor community; the significance of PE tax breaks, which generations of policymakers have refused to abolish; and much else besides. Ultimately, it’s a question of balance. The examination of how a handful of individuals experience life at the sharp end of private equity’s pillaging can, without doubt, add texture and color to our understanding, helping to humanize the impacts of an industry often discussed in dry financial terms. But it’s questionable whether it can do more than that, not least because those experiences are not categorically different from the experiences of individuals ensnared by capitalist ravages more generally. Private equity, to my mind at least, has always internalized a fundamental tension concerning its ability to exit its investments, which is typically achieved either through a sale to another private buyer (whether a strategic trade buyer or another financial investor) or through an IPO on the stock market. Why, one wonders, are other investors willing to pay the top-dollar exit price that private equity, by its very nature, demands? If—as is generally assumed to be the case—the PE firm has itself exhausted all the obvious opportunities for value enhancement and extraction during its period of ownership, why buy what’s left? If all the fruit has been plucked and the PE firm has achieved its signature goal of exiting at maximum value, is not the only way for the subsequent value of those assets, in fact, down? Over the past couple of years, it seems that the penny may have finally dropped. PE firms are widely struggling to exit their investments profitably and return cash to their clients. In mounting desperation, they have turned to launching so-called “continuation vehicles”—essentially, mechanisms for extending fund life and protecting the book value of marginal assets—but clients, smelling a rat, have been reluctant to back them. A vicious circle seems to be setting in: Required to hold on to assets for longer and longer periods, private equity is, as the financial journalist Katie Martin observes, “squeezing more of the juice out of them, and leaving little for public market investors,” thereby making it even harder still to achieve an exit. The upshot is that the PE sector is now sitting on some $3 trillion worth of unsellable assets. And as clients have become increasingly frustrated with the difficulties of achieving and realizing gains from PE investments, they have responded by beginning to allocate less capital to the sector. Private-equity fundraising slid to a seven-year low in the last year, and with a record number of firms chasing this dwindling pot of capital, many have resorted to “unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash,” not least markedly lower fees. No wonder that PE firms have meanwhile been lobbying furiously for access to new sources of capital, with America’s individual retirement savings—hitherto off-limits for PE managers—considered the holy grail, and President Trump seemingly willing to oblige. In short, the PE sector, and its profitability prospects, are under pressure as perhaps never before, making it possible to ask a question that until recently would have been deemed outlandish: Has private equity had its moment in the sun? If so, and for reasons that Bad Company and all the other recent PE books make abundantly clear, few will feel any sympathy.

November 20, 2025 04:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Janitorial Services Market With Impact Analysis of US Tariffs (2025 Edition)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.One of the most significant drivers of the janitorial services market is the heightened awareness of health and hygiene, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shifted the way businesses, institutions, and even households perceive cleanliness. As organizations adopt stricter cleaning protocols to mitigate the spread of infections, the demand for professional janitorial services has surged. Regular deep cleaning, sanitation, and disinfection have become standard practices in many industries, particularly healthcare, hospitality, and retail.Moreover, due to expansion of commercial spaces such as offices, malls, and entertainment centres has also contributed to the growth of the janitorial services market. As new buildings and facilities are constructed, there is a corresponding demand for ongoing cleaning and maintenance services. This demand is particularly prominent in rapidly urbanizing regions, where commercial real estate and industrial activities are increasing. In developing economies, urbanization and industrialization have led to the rise of new buildings, fuelling the need for more comprehensive cleaning services.Another factor driving the janitorial market is the growing preference for eco-friendly and sustainable cleaning solutions. As environmental concerns become more prevalent, companies are increasingly opting for green cleaning practices that minimize the use of harmful chemicals and reduce environmental impact. Janitorial service providers that offer green cleaning options are seeing greater demand, especially from environmentally conscious organizations and sectors like education and healthcare. Furthermore, innovations in cleaning technologies are also playing a significant role in the expansion of the janitorial services market. The adoption of advanced cleaning equipment, such as automated floor scrubbers, high-efficiency vacuums, and even robotic cleaners, has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of janitorial services. These technological tools enable faster and more thorough cleaning, which is particularly important for large-scale facilities such as airports, shopping centres, and hospitals.The janitorial services market in North America is mature, with steady demand driven by the healthcare, corporate, and retail sectors. The United States is the largest contributor to the region's market, where businesses continue to outsource cleaning services to improve efficiency. Additionally, the growing adoption of green cleaning solutions and the demand for specialized cleaning services in healthcare facilities are contributing to the market's growth. Moreover, in Asia-Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth in the janitorial services market, driven by increasing urbanization, industrialization, and the expansion of commercial spaces. Countries such as China, India, and Japan are key contributors to the market's growth, where the rise of new infrastructure and commercial projects creates a strong demand for cleaning services. The hospitality and retail sectors, in particular, are expanding in this region, further fuelling the demand for janitorial services.Outsourcing facility management, including janitorial services, allows businesses to cut costs significantly. By outsourcing, companies avoid the expense of hiring, training, and managing in-house cleaning staff, purchasing cleaning equipment, and maintaining inventory of supplies. Specialized janitorial service providers can offer more cost-effective solutions due to economies of scale, better pricing on cleaning materials, and expertise in optimizing cleaning schedules. This makes outsourcing an attractive option, especially for large businesses and organizations with extensive facilities.Companies are increasingly focusing on their core competencies and leaving non-core functions such as cleaning and facility management to professionals. By outsourcing janitorial services, organizations can allocate more resources and time to improving their primary operations, such as customer service, production, or business development. This is particularly appealing to businesses in industries like healthcare, education, and hospitality, where the main focus is on delivering quality services to customers, patients, or students.Janitorial service providers bring specialized knowledge, expertise, and the latest technologies to facility management. With access to modern cleaning methods, eco-friendly products, and advanced equipment such as robotic cleaners and automated systems, outsourced providers can deliver high-quality services that meet industry standards. This allows businesses to benefit from cutting-edge cleaning solutions without the need to invest in expensive equipment or train staff.

Title: Bitcoin just hit a critical point: analysts split between $85K crash and $250K surge

While Bitcoin price has recovered from the low of $88,540 hit on November 19, the question is whether it will hit a higher high than the $93,403 registered on November 18. Some analysts believe BTC is preparing for a deeper slide, while others insist a powerful rebound is already forming beneath the surface. At press time, BTC price was around $92,237 and already showing signs of exhaustion, which would spell doom since it formed a lower low on November 19, which is a bearish sign. At $92,237, Bitcoin (BTC) is reeling from a bruising stretch that has erased more than $33,000 from its value in under two months. Notably, today’s uptick follows a pause in ETF outflows and a rebound in tech stocks, driven by Nvidia’s stronger-than-expected earnings. While the market remains on edge as macro uncertainty and shifting liquidity conditions continue to pressure risk assets, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson remains one of the strongest voices calling for a major rebound. During CNBC’s Squawk Box show on Tuesday, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s recent losses reflect broader macro distortions, including tariff tensions, recession risks, and uneven regulatory signals. Hoskinson believes these forces will ease in the coming months. He expects BTC to recover sharply and potentially hit $250,000 within the next year, projecting that institutional adoption and large-scale tokenisation will redefine market cycles. Michael Saylor shares a similar level of confidence, viewing the current downturn as typical of Bitcoin’s long-term behaviour. The MicroStrategy executive says the company is built to withstand extreme drawdowns, calling his position “indestructible” in a recent interview with Fox Business. ₿etter than Ever. Today I was the warm-up act for @natbrunell as we both talked Bitcoin with @cvpayne. You’ll want to hear what she had to say. pic.twitter.com/vDaFceyeza — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 18, 2025 Notably, Saylor has continued to buy BTC even as volatility increases, reinforcing his view that deep corrections are part of the broader path toward higher valuations. ETF activity has also become a pivotal factor. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF posted a record $523 million daily loss on November 18 following a streak of outflows across the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. The Bitcoin ETFs outflow seems to have stabilised, with IBIT seeing $60M worth of inflows on November 19. Analysts warn that sustained inflows will be essential if Bitcoin hopes to avoid a retest of this week’s lows. Not all signals point upward. Some traders see a real chance BTC could break below key support levels near $90,000. If the market fails to hold this support, prediction platforms indicate rising expectations of a drop toward $87,000. ETF outflows totalling more than $3 billion this month highlight lingering caution, and many retail participants remain hesitant after weeks of drawdowns. Macro conditions remain complicated. Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have faded, while recession concerns are resurfacing due to weak jobs data and ongoing trade friction. These pressures have limited upside momentum even as Nvidia’s tech rally briefly boosted risk appetite. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to trade like a high-beta asset tied closely to broader market sentiment, and the next few days may determine whether buyers regain control or whether sellers will test new lows.

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia!

Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Nearly two years after the inception of the Bitcoin ETF sector in the United States, these funds are currently grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by mounting concerns regarding a potential bear market in the coming months. This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest bought over $39 million in Bullish, Circle and BitMine shares as crypto stocks dipped, signaling conviction amid market weakness. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest increased its exposure to crypto-related stocks on Wednesday, purchasing Bullish, Circle Internet Group and BitMine Immersion Technologies across multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as crypto stocks slid deeper into the red. According to ARK’s daily trade disclosure, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) bought 48,011 shares of Bullish, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) added 92,670 shares. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) made the largest move of the group, purchasing 322,917 shares of Bullish, bringing the total to $16.8 million. ARK followed this with sizeable buys of Circle, the company behind the USDC (USDC) stablecoin. ARKF picked up 22,327 shares and ARKW snapped up 43,174, while ARKK added 150,518 shares, acquiring around $15 million worth of shares in the stablecoin issuer. ARK also added BitMine shares. ARKF purchased 26,923 shares, and ARKW added 51,954. ARKK accumulated the single largest amount at 181,774 shares, bringing the total amount to $7.6 million. Related: ARK Invest resumes crypto buying spree, adds BitMine and Bullish shares The buying came as crypto-exposed stocks broadly weakened as the crypto market continues to retreat from October highs. Bullish fell 3.63% on the day to $36.39, continuing its recent slide before recovering slightly in after-hours trading. Circle closed the session down nearly 9% at $69.72. BitMine finished the day down 9.5% at $29.18, though it recovered more than 6% after hours. Michael Saylor-led Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy was hit even harder, dropping 9.82% on the day before recovering some losses in the after-hours. Notably, ARK has been on a crypto buying spree over the past week amid tumbing crypto prices. On Monday, the firm purchased $10.2 million worth of BitMine shares as its stock price slid to a new record low. Related: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest adds BitMine shares as it offloads $30M in Tesla stock As Cointelegraph reported, Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter on Wednesday, posting $57 billion in revenue and $31.9 billion in profit, both well above Wall Street expectations. The chip maker also issued a strong fourth-quarter revenue forecast of $65 billion, easing weeks of market anxiety over whether AI demand was starting to cool. The upbeat earnings boosted sentiment across tech and crypto-linked equities. Nvidia shares jumped more than 5% after hours, and the momentum spilled over into Big Tech, with Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all posting after-hours gains.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum staking plans with new Delaware trust
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-expands-ethereum-staking-plans-with-new-delaware-trust/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T07:55:09Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has taken another step toward a staking-focused Ethereum ETF by setting up a new statutory trust in Delaware, signalling fresh movement in the fast-growing market for yield-generating crypto products. The trust, called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, was officially formed on Nov. 19, according to state records. While the filing does not include product documents, it adds to a broader industry shift toward staking features within regulated ETFs. The move positions BlackRock to explore yield-bearing structures as competitors such as Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey advance their own staking plans across major digital asset funds. The new trust was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires full disclosures before any product reaches investors. This registration serves as a preliminary step rather than a full submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. To move forward, BlackRock would still need to file a Form S-1, but the firm has not provided a timeline. Delaware continues to be a popular state for early-stage ETF setup because of its regulatory structure, and BlackRock has often used the same route when preparing digital asset products. The trust now sits alongside ETHA, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF that launched in July 2024. ETHA has attracted more than $13 billion in inflows and currently does not stake its holdings. Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 in July 2025 to allow ETHA to stake ETH with approved validators. If approved, that update would introduce staking rewards while also requiring detailed disclosures about custody arrangements, slashing risks, validator selection, and the handling of locked ETH. Staking rewards on Ethereum generally range between 3% and 5% each year, and issuers must explain how they will track, calculate, and distribute those rewards. BlackRock’s move comes as the broader ETF market accelerates toward staking-enabled products. Grayscale received approval in October 2025 to introduce staking within ETHE and its Mini Trust ETF, making them the first Ethereum funds under the 1933 Act permitted to earn staking rewards. Other issuers, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey, have also submitted similar filings. REX-Osprey already operates a staked Solana ETF and launched a staked Ethereum version in September. BlackRock’s digital assets head Robert Mitchnick said staking features across ETFs could attract between $10 and $20 billion by mid-2026. Experts now expect the next catalyst to be BlackRock’s potential S-1 submission, which would move the new trust closer to becoming a yield-bearing Ethereum ETF. ETF analysts say expanding staking options could lock a significant amount of ETH within regulated products, influencing liquidity and long-term supply. The combination of new filings, updated fund structures, and rising capital inflows has set up a competitive race among issuers. BlackRock’s new trust adds another step in that process, signalling how institutional demand for Ethereum staking continues to reshape the ETF landscape.

BlackRock has now joined the race to launch a staked ether ETF, registering the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware on Nov. 19, according to a state filing highlighted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. The registration is only an initial step and not yet a formal application under the Securities Act of 1933, but it signals that the world’s largest asset manager is preparing to seek approval for a yield-bearing ether product. BlackRock's move comes weeks after VanEck registered a similar trust tied to Lido’s staked ETH, positioning issuers for the next phase of competition once regulators give clarity on whether staking can be included in U.S. ETFs. The first wave of spot ETH ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC told issuers to strip the feature, citing its view that certain staking services could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

November 20, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the half year ended 30 September 2025 Resilient half year performance with good progress on delivery of key growth projects GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: “We have continued to build on an encouraging start to the year and in the first half we have reached important milestones in the delivery of major projects key to our long-term growth plans. Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges, we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so. As the current year has progressed, we have faced two challenges: firstly, the impact from the disruption to our parcels network from the harmonisation of InPost and Yodel services combined with the commercial terms of our new 3-year contract has been greater than we had anticipated, and secondly, while obconnect continues to build its new business pipeline and range of opportunities, the pace of growth and monetising of these opportunities in year is slower than we had planned. In the first half, the underlying business performance has continued to trade in line with expectations and, throughout the Group, we have continued to broaden the adoption of our enhanced capabilities into our existing client base, develop and execute on strong new business pipelines and accelerate the execution of our key strategic projects. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service in August 2025 for the Lloyds Banking Group, enabling consumer cash deposits via their banking app across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. In September 2025, we extended the service to enable deposits via card for their customers in 3,000 sites, and we are now working to enable further High St Banks for the service over the next 12 months. In Parcels, we announced the strategic investment by Royal Mail into the Collect+ business in September 2025, with over 3,000 sites now branded as Royal Mail Shop enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collect, send and return parcels. In both these projects the key to the ramp up of significant transaction volumes is a strong follow-on communications and marketing campaign to support consumer awareness and adoption of these services through our network. In Open Banking and Digital payments, we have secured further wins as we grow our strong market position in the Housing sector particularly, including Peabody Housing for the full suite of MultiPay payment solutions and the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments for Confirmation of Payee. In addition, we are delivering several open banking initiatives into our utilities client base while working closely with obconnect in identifying new sector opportunities for open banking. In Love2shop, our partnership with InComm Payments has continued to accelerate, with further expansion into major retailers and a material step up in billings ahead of peak. Consumer uncertainty and tightening household budgets are not new factors as we enter the peak trading period for several of our businesses. For the second half of the year, our focus remains on 1) tight cost discipline and driving efficiencies as we continue to work with Nile Partners to establish the right organisational framework for the future, 2) strong execution of the projects supporting our long-term growth plans, and 3) good operating disciplines across the business as a whole and agility to respond to the two specific business challenges and the broader changing market conditions. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our long-term objectives has provided the platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year” DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 0.6% to £33.1 million (H1 FY25: £32.9 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased by 7.5% to £8.6 million (H1 FY25: £8.0 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 4.4% to £26.0 million (H1 FY25: £24.9 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue decreased by 9.6% to £17.0 million (H1 FY25: £18.8 million) MANAGING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CHALLENGES As the current year has progressed, we have faced two specific business challenges: 1. Impact of renewed 3-year commercial contract and InPost/Yodel network harmonisation Following the acquisition of Yodel by InPost, a new 3-year commercial contract was negotiated and agreed for the combined business. This contract recognised the continued importance of the long-term partnership between InPost and PayPoint, including a commitment to a minimum level of volume through the Collect+ network and an expansion of the number of sites offered to InPost customers to reflect the existing Yodel network, albeit on less favourable commercial terms to PayPoint. Our expectation has been that the enlarged Collect+ network for InPost / Yodel customers would result in increased volumes to mitigate these less favourable commercial terms. In the second quarter this has not been the case, with the initiatives from InPost to harmonise the enlarged InPost/Yodel business resulting in significant disruption to service and parcel volumes across the Collect + network. We believe the immediate impact of this operational disruption has now reduced, largely managed through proactive actions from the two businesses and we expect to see volumes through the Collect + network recover as we move into the traditional peak trading period. 2. New business pipeline growth in obconnectIn obconnect, the first half has seen a consolidation in the business and reassessment of the new business opportunities following PayPoint taking a majority ownership of the business. For PayPoint, obconnect delivers the platform to drive growth for both new and existing clients through the provision of Open Banking services and payments channels. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as well as broader Open Banking solutions. We have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with Verification of Payee (VoP) in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY26 and into next year. Our confidence in the opportunities obconnect brings from its range of capabilities and technology is undiminished. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. The market for Account-to-Account (A2A) payments and account information across Europe, UK and USA remains strong and obconnect is well positioned to help organisations achieve connectivity to these ecosystems. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was also agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for PayPoint and obconnect. Following a maiden contribution in the first half, we expect obconnect to deliver a stronger performance in the second half and an improvement in net revenue achieved for H2 FY25. DELIVERY OF KEY GROWTH PROJECTS The standout achievement of the first half has been the successful launch of multiple projects that enhance our consumer proposition in several areas of our business, establish important partnerships and strengthen the long-term prospects of the business. Each of these projects has required detailed planning and collaboration with our partners and a business wide effort to deliver. In each case the focus is now shifting from rollout to the necessary marketing and consumer awareness campaigns to drive awareness and adoption. 1. Launch of PayPoint BankLocal with the Lloyds Banking Group On 26 August 2025, we launched our BankLocal service enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. This successful launch was supported by a business-wide effort to prepare and train our retailer partners to deliver this vital new service, with over 240,000 direct communications delivered, over 4,000 store visits completed and a Trustpilot score of 4.9/5 achieved from retailer feedback. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed7 since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service further with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. 2. Launch of Royal Mail Shop and strategic investment in Collect+ by Royal Mail As announced on 30 September 2025, International Distribution Services (IDS), owner of Royal Mail, completed a strategic investment in Collect+ to take a 49% ownership, with an investment of £43.9 million, valuing the Collect+ business at £90 million. The Collect+ business has seen strong growth over the past 5 years as we have established it as the leading open Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK. Currently, Collect+ has a network of over 14,000 OOH locations in the UK, of which almost 8,000 offer Royal Mail collect, send and return parcel services today. As part of the next stage in this partnership, over 3,000 of these sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store. The balance of the 8,000 sites will have Royal Mail Shop branding rolled out over the course of the next 6 months. Over the next 12 months the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks by Q4 FY26. 7 As of close of business 16 November 2025 Establishing this partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK. As an open network, Collect+ will continue to work closely with the carrier partners with whom it has well-established relationships to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK and to invest in the technology and training required to deliver an outstanding consumer experience. 3. Acceleration of Love2shop partnership with InComm PaymentsFollowing the launch of our partnership with InComm Payments in October 2024, we have established a strong new sales channel enabling distribution of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St brands. The partnership has delivered a strong half year performance, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5%. We have also delivered further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, with sales in this channel +54% year on year, leveraging the strength of the Love2shop brand and reinforcing our expanded multichannel strategy for Love2shop gift card sales across digital and physical channels Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026.

Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations.

Our longer-term growth targets to the end of FY28 As announced at our full year results in June 2025, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group Our strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum in the medium term. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x The actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, it has been an intensive period where we have focused our efforts on supporting our retailer partners to deliver more revenue from PayPoint services and a business-wide effort to prepare and train sites ahead of the major launches of BankLocal and Royal Mail Shops. Our new Store Growth Specialist team, launched at the beginning of the financial year, has continued to have a positive impact with retailers, driven by targeted data and support. The learnings from the success of this team are now being assessed, with a view to scaling best practice across our entire field team. Key focus areas in the half year have been merchandising new Love2shop physical gift card units in over 2,000 sites ahead of the key peak trading period and completing an extensive training and merchandising programme for our BankLocal and Royal Mail Shop rollouts. Over 4,000 site visits have been completed in total, with positive retailer partner feedback and successful launches delivered for both services. In our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, 16 campaigns have been delivered for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. In ATMs, there are some early signs of progress from the actions already taken in the business with the estate performance now aligned with LINK industry transaction data. In addition to the recovery plan already implemented at the beginning of the year, we have completed a thorough strategic review of this business, with plans underway to optimise sites across the network driven by data and supported by our enhanced maintenance and support partnership with NoteMachine. In Cards, we continue to strengthen the operating foundation to the business with a greater focus on optimising profitability per merchant: a continued strong performance in Telesales, a reset of our Field sales approach and head count, further processes to support early life merchant experience and churn management, further proposition enhancements for merchants, supported by the improvements to pricing governance, time to transact and customer onboarding delivered in the last financial year. Proposition enhancements for merchants include an updated terminal application enabling split bill and digital receipt functionality, real-time transaction data now live in our merchant mobile app and app registrations in total on course to exceed our target of 10,000 merchants by the end of FY26. We now have 6 integrations and partnerships live for merchants to access our services. In October 2025, we launched our new e-comm product, in partnership with Global Payments, including Pay By Link functionality in the app and integration with major shopping carts. Over H2, there is an active roadmap of future proposition enhancements which will be delivered, including Tap to Pay in app, 7-day settlement and the launch of a ‘Pay Once’ proposition. We have also delivered a positive performance for Business Finance via YouLend, with over £14.6 million of funding provided to businesses, up 58% year on year. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service for the Lloyds Banking Group on 26 August 2025, enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has successfully built on our existing neobank deposit service and has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. Looking ahead to H2, a second major bank is now going live later than planned in Q4 FY26 and we have plans in progress to enable more High St banks for the service over the course of the next 6 months, as well as enabling a more extensive use of our Counter Cash withdrawal service. In addition, we are well underway with plans to develop and launch an SME solution for cash deposits in 2026. Across the whole division, data analytics is now central to how we operate, make decisions, and deliver value to customers and partners. Analytics have been embedded into decision-making for external clients and retail partners, combining multiple sources like regional performance, demographic insights, and usage patterns. This unified view is a major step forward, and there is the opportunity to refine these models further, expand data sources, and improve predictive accuracy in the future. Our algorithms now recommend tailored product mixes for retailers and identify promotions that drive sales and partner returns, with our investment in AI and machine learning opening the door to further development of predictive analytics, enabling teams to act on insights quickly and effectively. The work ahead in this area will unlock even greater visibility, efficiency, and value for our customers, partners and the business as a whole. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, there continues to be strong momentum for Collect+, with net revenue +7.5% at £8.6 million and parcel transactions growing to 74.3 million. Collect+ is well-established as the leading Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK and, as an open network, we will continue to work closely with our carrier partners to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK. In the half year, we have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,274 sites in new locations and demographics, including a new partnership with Gridserve, the leading EV charging network. As announced on 30 September 2025, Royal Mail has now taken a strategic investment in Collect+. Over 3,000 sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collecting, sending and returning parcels. This will form part of over 8,000 sites that will feature Royal Mail Shop branding over the next 6 months. In addition, we have now launched the sale of stamps across the 8,000 sites, including a retail exclusive set of 4 Christmas Stamps available at Royal Mail Shops. Over the next 12 months, the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. This partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK, again enhancing our retailer and consumer propositions delivering vital services at the heart of communities across the UK. In the half, we have also signed a new 3-year commercial agreement with InPost and Yodel, including the potential to utilise up to 6,000 Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) locations within Collect+ network. We had underappreciated the disruptive impact of the InPost/Yodel harmonisation and subsequent logistical challenges in our parcels business but took proactive operational actions to mitigate impact this disruption, including establishing priority routing and collections for high volume stores, dedicated PUDO-only routes and regular communications with affected stores. We expect these actions have now addressed the operational issues in the network, resulting in volumes recovering as we enter the peak trading period. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 17.2% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Peabody, RHP, Orwell Housing Association and Gloucester City Homes, and in the Charity sector with Thames Hospice and Firefighter’s Charity. There continues to be a focus on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. Our Open Banking solutions are unlocking further pipeline opportunities, supporting major clients with cheque replacement solutions via our PayPoint OpenPay service and our new Suspense Manager solution, tackling the issue of unallocated customer payments. In Open Banking, we have made further progress in executing on our strategy. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 70 clients now live for our services, including the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments, and AccessPay for Confirmation of Payee and Thirteen Group live for PISP. In obconnect, we have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with VoP in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY25 and into next year. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for both PayPoint and obconnect. In our cash through to digital category, we have now rolled out new display units to a further 2,000 sites, combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. We intend to expand further the number of stores offering Love2shop physical gift cards and our digital Pin on Receipt brands over the course of H2. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, with sales +54% year on year, and the continuing success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. In addition, our existing neobank cash deposit service processed over £342 million of deposits in the half, complementing our new BankLocal service for High St banks. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 17.7% for the half year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient. Over the half year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at £1,803 for April to June 2025 and £1,672 for July to September 2025. However, the price cap has been confirmed in the current quarter at £1,707 for pre-pay customers for October to December 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, Love2shop continues to trade in line with expectations for the current year, with net revenue in H1 affected by the changes to the timing of revenue recognition for expiry of cards following the adoption of a more prudent accounting treatment in FY24. Under the previous policy ‘end of life’ revenue was recognised progressively over the life of the card. Proactive management of this accounting change ahead of the current financial year will result in a stronger H2 performance as the expiry dates of cards issued in prior periods are weighted towards the second half of the current year. While this change results in the deferral of revenue to the expiry date, it has no material impact on the total revenue expected over the life of the cards. Overall, the Love2shop division has had a solid half year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in our partnership with InComm Payments. In Love2shop Business, we have delivered a positive performance, with billings +5.8% at £70.9 million (H1 FY25: £67.0 m), driven by a strong performance within Major Accounts and Platform sales. We are also leveraging AI across the business to better drive and target marketing engagement and new campaigns, with positive early results contributing to new business pipelines. Highstreetvouchers.com continues to trade in line with expectations. We have delivered a strong half year from our InComm Payments partnership, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5% since launch in October 2024. We have also made further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, supported by our new Store Growth Specialist team, with sales in this channel +54% year on year. Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2Shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026. Park Christmas Savings billings are expected to be broadly flat year on year for the Christmas 2025 season, against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. This has been supported by a strengthened Agent proposition, including the launch of Agent Perks and a new Agent App with over 13,000 downloads, an improved average order value for returning direct savers, and the launch of a more premium fulfilment experience and packaging for customers receiving orders for Christmas 2025. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform, processed £81.2 million in gift card value in in the half year (H1 FY25: £40.9 million), reflecting continued strong momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards DETAIL ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE IDS TRANSACTION The net proceeds of £34.1m on the £43.9m IDS investment in Collect+ is after deducting associated costs of £0.4m and £9.4m of tax from the gain on disposal. These proceeds were distributed in the form of a special dividend of 50 pence per share for c. 69 million eligible shares on 31 October 2025, with a resulting payment of £34.5m. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. This investment entitles IDS to a 49% minority share of the profits of Collect+ Brand Limited, which as part of the transaction now includes all revenues and associated costs from the wider E-commerce division, with the previous holding company (Collect+ Holdings Limited) prepared for dissolution. The Board anticipates the transaction as a whole to be EPS enhancing in the first full year to March 2027 through a combination of the special dividend, share consolidation and expected growth in volumes from the Royal Mail services through the Collect+ network. EPS enhancement assumptions include investment costs associated with the branding of the 8,000 Royal Mail sites, technology to support over the counter services, plus the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. UPDATE ON ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME As announced in our full year results in June 2025, an important step to the delivery of growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, the Group has recently completed the second phase of a project being supported by Nile, an independent consultancy firm. The key outputs from this phase have been the establishment of a target state framework for three key processes: onboarding, customer support, and billings and settlement. For each of these, key outcomes from moving to the target future state have been established. For example, in the case of onboarding, substantially reducing time taken to onboard new customers. In addition, for each process, this phase has quantified the benefits from moving to this future state, including both financial benefits (increased revenue, lower costs, lower operational risk events) and non-financial benefits (e.g. improved customer service/ satisfaction levels). Preliminary estimates have highlighted at least £2 million of operating profit upside, through a combination of reduced costs and improved net revenue, with the potential to grow this figure further through the next phase of work, which will include identifying technical solutions and external providers to support the shift to the future target state, along with the costs associated with this transition. This work is expected to be completed in advance of our full year results announcement in June 2026, with implementation commencing in early FY27. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received a claim from Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. Global 365’s claim was heard at a trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal between 10 June and 11 July 2025. PayPoint is confident that it successfully defended the claim by Global 365 and remains of the view that Global 365’s claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant PayPoint Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The parties are awaiting judgment from the Competition Appeal Tribunal. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year and achieving our medium-term financial goals. Whilst as a business we cannot determine the pace at which new services are adopted by consumers, the delivery of our key projects in the first half of the year is a great reflection of the progress we are making in the delivery of our long-term strategy. Whilst there remain challenges in the broader UK economy and in particular weak consumer confidence and tightening household budgets, we remain focused on the delivery of the key initiatives across the business that will deliver the outcome for the current year and foundations for the longer-term growth in the business. We are now into the most important seasonal trading period for several of our business areas where focused execution is key to the outcome for the current year. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our longer-term objectives have provided a strong platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board has declared an interim dividend of [19.8]p per share, an increase of [2.1]% vs the prior year interim dividend of 19.4p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. Nick WilesChief Executive 19 November 2025 FINANCIAL REVIEW Total revenue increased by £9.1 million (6.7%) to £144.1 million (September 2024: £135.0 million). Net revenue increased by £0.1 million (0.1%) to £84.7 million (September 2024: £84.6 million). The increase in Love2shop revenue was driven by single-retailer redemption products which have an associated cost of revenue and therefore a relatively small impact on net revenue. Total costs increased by £1.3 million to £59.0 million (September 2024: £57.7 million). The increase includes £1.7 million current period obconnect costs (prior period: £nil). There were also increases in cost of sales, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in finance costs, reflecting the Group’s increased borrowing. These impacts were partially offset by lower overhead costs. Exceptional costs are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance. The £3.2 million charge to September 2025 comprises legal fees incurred in defence of claims served against the Group and costs associated with the organisational framework to deliver greater automation and agility. The prior period exceptional cost comprised legal fees in defence of the same claims, plus the accelerated amortisation of certain modules of L2s ERP systems. The underlying profit before tax decreased by £1.2 million (4.5%) to £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). The current period result includes £1.2 million from the Love2shop segment, a decrease of £1.1 million (47.8%) on the prior period’s £2.3 million. The Love2shop decrease reflects the change in expiry date of sold vouchers. The September 2024 result benefitted from significant non-redemption revenue from expiry on vouchers in August 2024, whereas the equivalent non-redemption revenue will be earned in the second half of the current financial year. Profit before tax decreased by £3.2 million (13.9%) to £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). The decrease is mainly due to the £2.7m adjusting item in the prior period for the increase in fair value of the Group’s investments in obconnect, prior to the acquisition of obconnect in October 2024. Underlying EBITDA decreased by £0.2 million to £37.3 million (September 2024: £37.5 million), comprising £33.3 million for the PayPoint segment (September 2024: £32.0 million) and £4.0 million for the Love2shop segment (September 2024: £5.5 million). Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million), delivered from underlying profit before tax of £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. Net corporate debt decreased by £13.4 million to £84.0 million at September 2025 (March 2025: £97.4 million). This is as a result of positive cash generation and proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partly offset by working capital requirements in the first six months along with the exceptional settlement payment, share buy-back and tax, capex and dividend requirements. At 30 September 2025 loans and borrowings were £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million). PAYPOINT SEGMENT Shopping net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million). Service fees net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) driven by the additional PayPoint Mini sites and the annual RPI increase. Cards net revenue decreased by £0.5 million (3.0%); a reduction in acquiring revenue was partially offset by an increase in lending revenue, with rental revenue flat. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £0.2 million (5.0%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million), driven by strong growth in transaction numbers, which increased by 20.0%. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), including £1.9 million net revenue from obconnect, acquired by the Group in October 2024. Excluding the impact of obconnect, net revenue decreased by £0.8 million compared with the prior period. Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million) driven by a 15.1% reduction in transactions caused by reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue, excluding obconnect, increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million). The cost of commission to retailers increased by £1.3 million (6.5%) to £21.3 million (September 2024: £20.0 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of transactions processed and a higher proportion of transactions with higher commission rates. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £2.0 million (4.9%) to £43.2 million, including a £0.9 million increase in finance costs due principally to the share buy-back programme, £1.8 million obconnect costs following acquisition in October 2024, £0.5 million additional depreciation on cards devices, partially offset by a £1.2m decrease in overhead and other costs, reflecting cost saving measures implemented. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services PayPoint provides to retailer partners, which form part of PayPoint’s network, and SME partners. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, card payments, terminal leasing, ATMs, Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million) primarily due to the growth in service fees. The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 30 September 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,962 UK sites, an increase of 2.7% primarily due to new PayPoint mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint One, PayPoint Mini and our legacy terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) to £11.6 million driven by an increase in the number of revenue- generating sites compared to the prior period. Card Payments: Card payments net revenue overall decreased by 3.0% to £16.1 million (September 2024: £16.6 million). Card payments acquiring services generated £10.3 million net revenue in the six-month period, a reduction of £0.9 million from the previous year (September 2024: £11.2 million), reflecting the decrease in the number of SME and retailer partners and in the average value processed per merchant. Card payments lending and other net revenue increased by £0.4 million to £0.6 million. Transaction values overall decreased by 4.4% to £3,428 million (September 2024 £3,585 million). Card payment terminal rentals remained at £5.2 million, with a slight reduction in the number of terminals. Net revenue reduced by £0.2m (5.0%) to £3.8 million (September 2024: £4.0 million) as transactions reduced by 9.4% to 11.5 million. This reflects a continuation of the reduced demand for cash across the economy, although net revenue from Counter Cash was flat. ATM and Counter Cash live sites increased 9.3% to 7,094, reflecting the new local banking service which went live in September 2025. Other: Other shopping services, which includes FMCG voucher campaigns, remained at £1.6 million. E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) due to the continued increase in total parcels transactions, by 20.0% to 74.3 million. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Parcel sites increased by 6.4% to 14,274 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), benefitting from the £1.9 million contribution from obconnect. This was partially offset by the impact of fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash - bill payments and top ups net revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million). Digital (MultiPay, Direct Debits, Cash Out and Open banking) net revenue increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million) and digital transactions increased by 1.8 million (9.0%) to 21.9 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by £0.5 million to £3.4 million (September 2024: £2.9 million) with transactions remaining at 13.9 million. Cashout net revenue decreased by £0.1 million (7.3%) to £1.1 million (September 2024: £1.2 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue increased by £0.1 million (2.9%) to £3.5 million (September 2024: £3.4 million) and transactions increased by 0.7 million (18.2%) to 4.5 million (September 2024: 3.8 million). eMoney transactions derive a substantially higher fee per transaction than traditional top-up transactions as they are more complex to process. Other Payments & Banking net revenue includes SIM sales, interest generated by investing cash received on client funds and other ad-hoc items which contributed £2.7 million (September 2024: £2.6 million) net revenue. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) generated £106.7 million total billings in the period, an increase of 4.6% on the prior period. Billings are a measure of the total value of balance sold on cards and vouchers. The business is seasonal in nature, and profit is primarily generated in the second half of the financial year, which represents the peak trading period of the L2s corporate business and of the dispatch of Park Christmas savings prepaid products prior to Christmas The £5.7 million (11.5%) increase in revenue is largely attributable to single-retailer cards and vouchers, partially offset by a £2.1 million decrease in non-redemption income. The latter reflects the change in the annual expiry date of a significant proportion of cards and vouchers, from the first half of the prior financial year to the second half of the current financial year. Net revenue for the 6 months to 30 September 2025 was £17.0 million, a decrease of £1.8 million (9.6%) on prior period, principally due to the decrease in non-redemption income referred to above. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of £5.0 million (September 2024: £5.8 million) on profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million) represents an effective tax rate of 24.9% (September 2024: 25.1%). This is lower than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to the tax impact of share-based payments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of £102.0 million (September 2024: £104.2 million) decreased by £2.2 million, reflecting the continuation of the share buyback program and dividends, partially offset by profit for the period and the part-disposal of Collect+. Current assets increased by £15.2 million to £364.6 million (September 2024: £349.4 million), mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets of £240.6 million (September 2024: £238.3 million) increased by £2.3 million, of which £16.6 million arose on the acquisition of obconnect (£12.2 million goodwill, £11.0 million intangible assets, less £6.6 million previously recorded as investments). Partially offsetting this was a £12.3 million decrease in the fair value of the Group’s investments in Yodel. Current liabilities increased by £6.5 million to £364.4 million (September 2024: £357.9 million), including a £7.4 million increase in the share buyback liability. Phase two of the share buy-back programme, which commenced in July 2025, was for £30 million of committed share purchases, compared with £20 million for phase one. Non-current liabilities of £138.9 million (September 2024: £125.6 million) increased by £13.3 million, including a £7.1 million increase in loans and borrowings, a £3.6 million increase in deferred tax, of which £2.5 million arose on the obconnect acquired intangible assets, and a £3.6 million settlement provision. At 30 September 2025 net corporate debt was £84.0 million (September 2024: £86.8 million), a decrease of £13.4 million from the year end position. This derives from positive cash generation and net proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partially offset by tax, capex and dividend requirements, along with an exceptional settlement and share buy-back payments. Total loans and borrowings of £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million), increased by £11.8 million from 31 March 2025, and comprise a £75.0 million non-amortising term loan, £40.0 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.3 million arrangement fees (September 2024: £63.0 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, £45.0 million non-amortising term loan, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.2 million arrangement fees). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow movements during the period. Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million) delivered from profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. The working capital outflow is higher than the prior period outflow, which benefitted from a £3.0 million cash collection from a key account in September 2024. The £10.4 million exceptional settlement payment relates to the Utilita accrual disclosed in the March 2025 financial statements. The £1.5 million pension contribution was to the L2s defined benefit scheme. The £43.5 million inflow from the part-disposal of subsidiary relates to the investment by IDS in the Group’s parcel division and is net of disposal costs. The £13.0 million share buyback outflow in the period exceeds the £4.4 million in the prior period, which included only 3 months’ share purchases of a lower annual committed amount than the current period commitment. Capital expenditure of £10.5 million (September 2024: £8.9 million) was £1.6 million higher than the prior period, primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems and Love2shop’s e-commerce project. DIVIDENDS In the six months to 30 September 2025, total dividend payments were £13.9 million or 19.6 pence per share (September 2024: £13.9 million or 19.2 pence per share), representing the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2025. This is a 2.1% increase on the final dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2024. On 17 October 2025 the Group approved a special dividend of 50.0 pence per share, paid on 29 October 2025 to shareholders on the register on 17 October 2025, representing c. 69 million eligible shares. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. We have declared an increased interim dividend of 19.8 pence per share (September 2024: 19.4 pence) payable in equal instalments of 9.9 pence per share on 19 December 2025 and 27 March 2026 (to shareholders on the register on 28 November 2025 and 27 February 2026 respectively). This is an increase of 1.0% compared to the final dividend declared of 19.6 pence per share, and an increase of 2.1% compared to 19.4 pence per share interim dividend for prior year. In aggregate, the special dividend and interim dividends will result in £46.9 million (September 2024: £13.9 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 30 September 2025, had approximately £101.4 million (September 2024: £67.9 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Board’s immediate priority is to continue to preserve PayPoint’s balance sheet strength. The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends.

Accounting policies Reporting entity PayPoint plc (‘PayPoint’ or the ‘Company’) is a public limited company, incorporated and registered in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered office is at Unit 1, The Boulevard, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, AL7 1EL. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) as at and for the six months ended 30 September 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). They were approved for issue on 20 November 2025. These interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the board of directors on 11 June 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statements under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been reviewed, not audited. Basis of preparationThe interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. Adoption of standards and policiesThe accounting policies applied by the Group in the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 are consistent with those set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provide sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 30 September 2025, the Group had corporate cash of £30.1 million. On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to its borrowing facilities, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 30 September 2025, £40.0 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility (30 September 2024: £63.0 million). The Group’s statement of financial position shows net assets of £102.0 million as at 30 September 2025 (£104.2 million as at 30 September 2024), having made a profit after tax for the period of £14.9 million (30 September 2024: £17.3 million) and delivered cash from operations of £20.8 million for the period (30 September 2024: £36.4 million). The Group has net current assets of £0.2 million at 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: net current liabilities of £8.5 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these interim financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. In addition to the ‘base case’ scenario, the Directors have prepared a ‘downside’ scenario which includes the following assumptions: Shopping E-commerce Payments and banking Love2shop Even with the above assumptions, the forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom and liquidity for the Group to continue with its existing borrowing facilities. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on deposit The nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Following the Love2shop acquisition, it also holds card and voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers, some of which is held in trust. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time; and(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the Consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the Consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows. Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 are as follows: Clients’ own fundsClients’ cash held in trust off the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 is £50.8 million (30 September 2024: £49.4 million). Alternative performance measuresNon-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the alternative performance measures disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. These measures are included in these interim financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They usually exclude the impact of one-off, non- recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group’s statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: See note 5 for explanations of the above exceptional items. Love2Shop billings (non-IFRS measures relating solely to the Love2Shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the period and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to billings being recognised at a different time to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‘net’ basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‘gross’ basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity of principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group’s strategy. A reconciliation from revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, financing income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on convertible loan notes. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reportingThe Group considers its Love2shop business to be a separate segment from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and it offers different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for both Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. The Group operates exclusively in the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of £11.5 million (September 2024: £10.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and up-front lump sum payments of £0.7 million (September 2024: £0.7 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. Multi-retailer non-redemption revenue is recognised when the product has expired (and, where applicable, when the right of refund has lapsed). The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on fourteen-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop’s corporate customers is fifteen-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of £6.5 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting period, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction prices in the period to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Seasonality of operationsFollowing the Group’s acquisition of Love2shop on 28 February 2023, its performance is now considered “highly seasonal” under IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The Love2shop business is heavily weighted towards the second half of the financial year, in particular the peak September to December pre-Christmas period when revenues from card, voucher and e-code redemptions are at their highest. The PayPoint business is far less seasonal, although its e-commerce division also generates its highest revenues in the pre- Christmas months. Bill payment transactions, which were historically higher during the winter months (H2), continue to be impacted by the shift in consumer behaviour towards making fewer, larger payments and structural changes in this market. Card payments typically generate higher value processed and revenue in the summer months (H1). Card terminal leasing revenue is relatively unaffected by seasonality. Other revenue Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs excluding adjusting items 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is £0.79 million (September 2024: £0.62 million) Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Legal feesThe current period legal fees relate to the Group’s defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem as a resolution of its concerns raised in Ofgem’s Statement of Objections received by the Group in September 2020. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. See note 12. Organisational framework costsThe current period organisational framework costs are fees to a third party engaged to support the Group deliver greater automation and agility. The work is expected to be completed during the year ending 31 March 2027, with total costs expected to exceed £1 million. 6. Tax 7. Earnings per shareBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue as follows: 8. Investments The fair values of the Group’s investments are as follows: No unrealised gains or losses arose in the current or prior period. Judge Logistics LtdJudge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group’s ecommerce parcel business. The Group’s investment in Judge Logistics Ltd is an equity investment of 4.5% of the ordinary share capital. This comprises an initial equity investment purchased for consideration of £100 on 26 July 2024 and a further 3.6% investment arising on conversion of the Group’s £15 million convertible loan note on 17 April 2025. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investments at fair values of £540,000 for the equity investment and £2,159,000 for the convertible loan note, i.e. £2,699,000 in aggregate. At 30 September 2025, based on the Company’s fair value assessment, it has maintained the fair value of its investment at £2,699,000. Aperidata LtdIn May 2024, the Group acquired an equity investment of 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for £0.2 million and purchased a convertible loan note investment in Aperidata Ltd for consideration of £1.0 million. At 31 March 2025 and at 30 September 2025, the Company fair valued the investments at their respective costs. 9. Part-disposal of subsidiaryOn 18 July 2025, the Company disposed of 20% of its investment in a wholly owned subsidiary, Collect+ Brand Ltd, to International Distribution Services plc (“IDS”), a third-party partner in the Group’s e-commerce division. The consideration, net of transaction costs, was £11.9 million. On 30 September 2025, the Company disposed of a further 29% of its investment in Collect+ Brand Ltd to IDS for consideration of £31.6 million, net of transaction costs. Total net consideration received was therefore £43.5 million. The Group retains control of Collect+ Brand Ltd following the above transactions, due to the rights associated with the Group’s remaining 51% ownership. Consequently, the Group continues to account for Collect+ Brand Ltd as a subsidiary. It now also recognises a non-controlling interest, to which 49% of Collect+ Brand Ltd’s post-tax result is attributed in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The combined transaction gave rise to a post-tax gain on disposal of £34.0 million reported within equity, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements (see Consolidated statement of comprehensive income). 10. Share capital, share premium, merger reserve and capital redemption reserve In the current period 140,828 shares were issued (of 1/3p each) for share awards which vested in the period and 7,432 matching shares were issued (of 1/3p each) under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. On 17 October 2025, the Group carried out a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date, following which the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share (see note 13). On 12 June 2025, the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least £30 million of shares per annum, in an extension to the programme which began on 1 July 2025. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group therefore recognised an initial liability for the full amount of £30.2 million (including stamp duty and associated costs) in the current period, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. A total of 1,859,450 shares were purchased in the period, with a nominal value of £6k. This resulted in a reduction in share capital of £6k and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve balance from £7k to £13k. The share premium of £1.0 million (September 2024: £1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of £18.2 million (September 2024: £18.2 million) comprises £1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and £17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 12. Contingent liabilityOfgem statement of objectionsFurther to the update provided on 12 June 2025, the Group’s position remains unchanged: it is confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365, which fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. As a result, no accounting provision has been made for this claims. The Group will continue to update the market on a quarterly basis as part of its financial reporting cycle. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group’s tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting dateShare consolidation and special dividendAt a special general meeting held on 17 October 2025, the Group’s shareholders approved a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date. As a result of the share consolidation, the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share. In all other respects, the new ordinary shares are equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, including their dividend, voting and other rights. At the same special general meeting on 17 October 2025, following approval of the share consolidation, the Group’s shareholders approved a special dividend of 50 pence per new ordinary share, payable to shareholders on the register on that date. The special dividend payment of £34.5 million was made on 31 October 2025. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Our risk management and internal control framework is designed to ensure that the Group maintains an effective and dynamic risk management process which identifies our risk exposures, ensures our programme of mitigating controls operates effectively and provides assurance to our stakeholders that effective risk management is embedded in our operations. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties remain closely aligned to those risks disclosed in the Strategic Report section of its Annual Report for the year ended 31st of March 2025 and are detailed below. RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT We confirm that to the best of our knowledge this set of interim financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted IFRS and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 (indication of important events during the first half and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining half of the year) and DTR 4.2.8 (disclosure of related parties’ transactions and changes therein). Nick Wiles Rob HardingChief Executive Finance Director Independent review report to PayPoint Plc Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements Our conclusionWe have reviewed PayPoint Plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial statements”) in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc for the 6 month period ended 30 September 2025 (the “period”). Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The interim financial statements comprise: The interim financial statements included in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We have read the other information contained in the Interim results and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements. Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review Our responsibilities and those of the directors The Interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Title: 1 in 3 young investors switched advisers over crypto access: Survey

Young and rich investors want wealth advisers to offer crypto, and some have moved their money from those who don’t, according to a survey by Zerohash. Money managers may need to rethink their approach to digital assets, with over a third of young, wealthy investors in a recent US survey indicating they had moved on from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Crypto payments provider Zerohash’s survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40, released on Wednesday, found that 35% had moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer access to crypto. Those surveyed had incomes between $100,000 and $1 million, and more than half of those who moved money due to an advisers lack of crypto offerings said they had moved between $250,000 and $1 million. Crypto has only recently enjoyed an ultra-friendly policy environment in the US, and some wealth advisers are still playing catch-up as younger investors are less risk-averse compared to past generations. Zerohash said that over four-fifths of those surveyed said their confidence in crypto was boosted due to its adoption by major finance institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. Zerohash found that respondents with incomes of $500,000 and up were “leading the exodus,” with half having moved from advisers over crypto access. The survey also found 84% of all respondents planned to increase their crypto holdings in the next year, with nearly half saying they would “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the findings show that crypto “has become essential to modern portfolio strategy” and many wealthy investors “are not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up.” “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” they said. Related: US government reopening may unleash crypto ETF floodgates: Analyst They added that investors were clear with their expectations and wanted “insured, compliant crypto access.” Zerohash said based on its survey results, its playbook for advisers to win investors is to offer crypto on “the same dashboard as traditional assets” with insured custody. “Investors expect more than Bitcoin and Ethereum,” it added. “Ninety-two percent say access to a broader range of digital assets is important.” Meanwhile, asset managers have begun offering exchange-traded products with exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, with products tied to altcoins including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE). More novel products have featured staking, which rewards users for locking up tokens to secure a blockchain. Major issuer BlackRock is also seemingly set to offer staking exposure, filing for a staked Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund in Delaware on Wednesday.

Title: A shorter shopping window complicates retail’s already challenging holiday season

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was originally published on sister site, Modern Retail. This season, retailers and shoppers alike are contending with a shorter holiday shopping window — on top of tariffs, waning consumer sentiment and recession fears. The 2025 holiday shopping season is shorter than usual, with 28 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That’s one extra day compared to last year’s ultra-condensed shopping season, but four fewer shopping days than 2023. Cyber Monday will fall in December this year, and Christmas will be on a Thursday. By some metrics, the holiday shopping season is shaping up to be merry and bright. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising as much as 4.2% over last year. Similarly, EMarketer is forecasting holiday sales of $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year over year. But the holiday season is unfolding against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. U.S. employment is worsening with the highest level of October layoffs in 22 years last month, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Retail was one of the most heavily impacted industries, Modern Retail previously reported. Tariffs and inflation have also negatively colored consumer sentiment heading into retail’s biggest sales season. Consumer sentiment has fallen about 6% in November so far, according to the most recent survey from the University of Michigan. All told, this year’s condensed shopping calendar is landing at a difficult moment for the industry. Retailers are already juggling tariff-related cost pressures that have complicated everything from inventory planning to pricing strategy, and now they have fewer days to make up crucial fourth-quarter sales. Consumers, meanwhile, are heading into the season with shaky confidence, tighter budgets and heightened sensitivity to prices. Taken together, a shorter runway and a more cautious shopper are reshaping when — and how much — people are willing to spend, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already strained holiday period.“We’re going to see a lot of different headwinds this year, and this is one of them,” said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney, where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. Here’s a look at how retailers and consumers are preparing for a shorter holiday season complicated by President Donald Trump’s trade war, inflation and a worsening labor market. Over the past few years, retailers have pulled forward the timing of holiday deals, kicking off the season outside of tentpole occasions like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year was no exception, as Amazon effectively kicked off the holiday season with its earliest ever “Big Deals Prime Day” sale in October. The sale ran from Oct. 7 through Oct. 8, slightly earlier than last year’s event, when the sales ran from Oct. 8 until Oct. 9. Retailers including Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s introduced overlapping promotions to pull in early holiday demand ahead of the Black Friday peak. Some retailers introduced their holiday marketing campaigns well before Halloween. Macy’s, for instance, started its “100 Days to Christmas” campaign in September. Meanwhile, Nordstrom launched its holiday season campaign at the end of October. Walmart promoted its Thanksgiving meal basket in late October. That strategy may become even more important this year as retailers navigate fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, along with concerns about how tariffs and inflation may impact consumer spending. Kearney’s Black said that while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the season’s biggest tentpoles, this year’s economic backdrop is amplifying the need for strong early performance. “Cyber Monday and Black Friday have never been more important,” she said, adding that economic uncertainty and higher prices are motivating people to seek out promotions earlier in the season. According to Circana’s annual holiday outlook survey, 44% of U.S. consumers say they plan to begin their holiday shopping earlier than they normally would. That’s up four percentage points higher from Circana’s survey last year. Nearly half of consumers plan to start shopping before Thanksgiving. Less than 20% will wait until December, which marks the lowest level of late-season holiday shoppers since 2021, according to the survey. Black said the shorter holiday shopping calendar may also hinder impulse purchases. “You may be a little less likely to pick up the ‘Oh, I need to get another gift’ thing. … So, it can absolutely have an impact,” she said. A shorter shopping window means operational precision matters more. Retailers have only a few weeks to move inventory and meet tighter shipping deadlines. Black said the fundamentals will be critical: “They need to have fast shipping. It needs to be easy for [the] consumer. They need to have great in-stocks, and the experience really matters.” That pressure is pushing retailers to diversify last-mile options. Kevin Sides, CEO at logistics provider ShipMonk, said shifting volume to regional carriers has become one of the biggest logistics trends across his client base heading into the peak holiday season. Indeed, regional carriers like Jitsu, SpeedX and Veho ramped up their service coverage in the U.S. earlier this year, per Supply Chain Dive. “It’s not just FedEx and UPS getting orders out and delivered anymore. These regionals have way more of a market share,” Sides said, citing alternative parcel carriers like OnTrac and UniUni. “If 50% of your volume [is] not going with a regional, you’re leaving a lot on the table from both cost and performance.” More specialty retailers inked partnerships with delivery startups in 2025, rather than building out their own fulfillment networks, to better compete with behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Old Navy and DoorDash, for instance, launched a nationwide partnership for same-day delivery of clothing and holiday items, making it one of the first major apparel retailers on the platform. Ace Hardware also inked a deal with DoorDash earlier this year, offering on-demand delivery from local hardware stores. Despite the compressed calendar, Sides said consumers shouldn’t expect widespread delivery disruptions, as long as they avoid last-minute ordering and pay attention to shipping deadlines. “There’s not a carrier that’s not [delivering] packages in time for the holidays when you’re shipping by the third [of December],” he said. “But consumers shouldn’t wait too much to the last minute.” As the season wears on and shipping cutoffs tighten, more shoppers may turn to stores. Bain & Company’s holiday forecast predicts that 36% of U.S. consumers will shop entirely or mostly in physical stores, up from 24% in 2024. Large retailers with expansive store networks can also lean more heavily on same-day and buy-online, pick-up in-store options. Brad Jashinsky, director analyst at Gartner. said these capabilities will become more important as shipping cutoffs approach. As he put it, “That’s where the advantage of Amazon, Walmart, Target and others [comes in], where they can utilize their very sophisticated supply chains or … in-store” fulfillment.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

Title: Meta Never Bought Monopoly Power, It Simply Discovered The Future

ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. “This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard – and you’ll never be heard from again.” That’s what Michael Ovitz, long known as the most powerful man in Hollywood, told Barry Diller when the former head of both Paramount and Fox informed Ovitz of his next act in business. It was the early 1990s, and Diller sensed the future was in screens “interacting with customers.” Diller sought and achieved control over the Home Shopping Network. Media types were aghast! Diller’s time in the proverbial wilderness rates thought as you read this, and you contemplate the meaning of the dismissal of the FTC’s case against Meta. The FTC filed suit against Meta on December 8, 2020 based on Meta’s prior purchases of Instagram ($1 billion) and WhatsApp ($19 billion) in 2012 and 2014 respectively. But if there had been strong evidence in 2012 and 2014 that Meta was buying monopoly power, then the latter would have revealed itself through exponentially higher price tags for both Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s really that simple. That they both could be purchased for a fraction of their present worth is all the evidence we need that as opposed to buying monopoly control of the social media sector, Meta (Facebook at the time) was taking on substantial, possibly existential risk with its purchases. Leaps into the future are expensive, and shareholders not infrequently revolt if they’re wrong. Which brings us to Meta’s share price 15 and 13 years ago. It was higher in November of 2012 (it closed the month at $28) than it was after the purchase of Instagram ($26.81) in December of 2012. As for WhatsApp, Meta shares were down $1 a month after the purchase, and $10 by the following month. Markets are a look ahead, but as evidenced by the share-price movement of Meta after it added Instagram and WhatsApp to its suite of free offerings for users, neither impressed investors. It’s a reminder that it took the information-pregnant marketplace a long time to reward Facebook’s vision. Which is telling. The crucial truth revealed through Meta’s stock price is that Facebook couldn’t have known it was purchasing monopoly power, let alone businesses that would subsequently exceed their purchase price worth, simply because no one knew. In business, tomorrow is another century. Which similarly requires thought as this opinion piece inches toward its conclusion. It was on November 30, 2022 that a little known (at least to the public) non-profit organization called OpenAI released ChatGPT, and in doing so, profoundly changed the present and future of Silicon Valley. Since then, Meta, once thought to be a “monopoly,” has invested hundreds of billions in a frenzied attempt to yet again discover a future that changes all the time based on developments in the present. It’s yet another reminder that in Silicon Valley, there are no monopoly purchases as is. There’s just investment in an ever-changing future that’s impossible to accurately foresee. This truth seems to have informed the court proceedings in the FTC’s dismissed lawsuit against Meta. Back to Ovitz and Diller, somewhere they’re nodding their heads in agreement. Foolish as Diller’s acquisition of HSN looked at the time, it proved a vehicle for him to become a billionaire internet entrepreneur though 155 different transactions over the years whereby much disdained HSN became the much revered IAC, or InterActiveCorp. Once briefly ridiculed, Diller is now lionized. In our dynamic economy there’s no buying dominance or “monopoly,” there’s just intrepid leaps into the future. That’s what Meta successfully did in risky fashion, thus the wise dismissal of the FTC’s lawsuit.

The practitioners of Hasbara are desperately ratcheting up their control of American corporate and social media and are reportedly seeking funding from the Arab Gulf states to help. The MAGA/MIGA conflict that is splitting Trump’s Republican coalition is one factor stressing zionist narrative control, but fundamentally fallout from Gaza is driving the desperation. The increasingly precarious state of the AI bubble that’s been propping up Silicon Valley and the entire American economy is putting more pressure on the financial underpinnings of Hasbara, Inc. Holocaust Education Sending Wrong Message? Former Obama, Clinton, Kerry and Gore speechwriter Sarah Hurwitz perhaps spoke more truth than she meant to when speaking (video) at the The 2025 General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America. Hurwitz starts with a pretty standard condemnation of 21st Century communications, blaming social media, although it is interesting to note her definition of “mainstream” as not expressing “extreme anti-Israel views.” I think that since October 7th, but really before then, there have been huge shifts in America on how people think about Jews and Israel. And I think that is especially true of young people. So, we are now wrestling with a new, I think, generational divide here. And I think that’s particularly true in that social media is now our source of media. It used to be that the the media you got in America was American media and it was pretty mainstream. It generally didn’t express extreme anti-Israel views. You had to go to a pretty weird bookstore to find global media and fringe media. But today, we have social media, which is a global medium. It is shaped, its algorithms are shaped by billions of people worldwide who don’t really love Jews. And so, while in the 1990s, you know, a young person probably wasn’t going to find Al Jazeera or someone like Nick Fuentes, today those media outlets find them. They find them on their phones. It’s also this increasingly post-literate media, less and less text, more and more videos. So, you have Tik Tok just smashing our young people’s brains all day long with video of carnage in Gaza. And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. So I want to give data and information and facts and arguments and they are just seeing in their minds carnage and I sound obscene. It’s also noteworthy that she does not see video evidence of mass murder as something that should be weighed equally with “facts and arguments.” But the novel thing she said regarded “Holocaust education” which she characterizes as “a very smart bet that made” “in this new media environment” but is now worried that it “may be confusing some of our young people” into thinking that “anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism” and “the lesson of the Holocaust is that you fight Israel.” I’m quoting this section in full because it’s the kind of thing that would have been dismissed as anti-Semitic conspiracy theory if said by Lyndon Larouche in the 1990s. And you know, I think unfortunately the very smart bet that we made on Holocaust education to serve as anti-Semitism education in this new media environment, I think that is beginning to break down a little bit because, you know, Holocaust education is absolutely essential, but I think it may be confusing some of our young people about anti-Semitism because they learn about big strong nazis hurting weak emaciated Jews and they think, ‘Oh, anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism, right? powerful white people against powerless black people.’ So when on TikTok all day long they see powerful Israelis hurting weak, skinny Palestinians, it’s not surprising that they think, ‘Oh, I know the lesson of the Holocaust is you fight Israel. You fight the big powerful people hurting the weak.’ Caitlin Johnstone titled her response “Zionists Are Freaking Out About Losing Control Of The Narrative” and I’ll quote a key passage: It’s just so fascinating to see a former White House speechwriter making so many of the points that anti-Zionists have been making for years, but taking the exact opposite meaning from them. … Hurwitz isn’t denying Israel’s abuses or framing its genocidal atrocities as the problem, she’s just coming right out and saying that people obtaining information and moral clarity about those abuses is the problem. The atrocities aren’t wrong, what’s wrong is people seeing those atrocities and calling them what they are. I love the way she complains that she looks “obscene” for trying to lay out arguments and narratives justifying the Gaza holocaust for people who’ve seen the “wall of carnage” from the genocide. I mean, yes. Yes obviously you’re going to look obscene if you try to tell someone why raw video footage of massacres, mutilated children and emaciated bodies is actually showing something that is justifiable and acceptable. You can’t stand in front of a pile of child corpses justifying their murder and then whine when people ignore your spinmeistering and keep staring at the tiny bodies. That’s like murdering an entire family and then telling the cops, “But you’re not listening to my reasons for killing them!” They’re doing the normal thing while you are being obscene. So yea, there’s that. Now that we’ve set the context and shown the panic driving Israel’s quest for total narrative control, let’s look at some of the tactical aspects of that quest. Taking Hasbara to Church and ChatGPT Haaretz dropped a blockbuster report ten days ago that reveals the aggressive and ambitious nature of Hasbara in 2025: The Israeli government has signed contracts worth millions of dollars in recent months to rehabilitate Israel’s standing in American public opinion, both online and offline. Amid a sharp drop in support from the conservative right, Israel has hired firms to conduct not just “hasbara [public diplomacy] campaigns” but also campaigns targeting millions of Christian churchgoers, bot networks to amplify pro-Israel messages online, and efforts to influence both search results and the responses given by popular AI services like ChatGPT. Among the experts recruited is a former campaign manager for Donald Trump and many of the other firms are linked to the Republican party or Evangelical communities, indicating that Israel is focusing massive efforts on communities once considered automatically pro-Israel. Among the campaigns’ goals is fighting antisemitism, which has risen alongside the decline in support for Israel. Together, these campaigns signal a new phase in Israel’s post-war public diplomacy strategy, and a shift in the way it uses agents – both AI and human influencers – for hasbara abroad. … Payments are routed through Havas Media Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of the international advertising and public relations giant Havas. In practice, Havas serves as an intermediary, executing contracts with U.S. firms on Israel’s behalf. The documents show that since 2018, the company has received at least $100 million to promote Israeli tourism campaigns in the United States and it also works with other countries, including several in the Gulf, on similar projects. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X, owned by Brad Parscale, who played a lead role in Trump’s digital campaigns in 2016 and 2020. The $6 million, four-month contract – signed between his firm and Havas Media on behalf of the Israeli government – calls for “strategic consulting, planning, and communications services to develop and execute a broad U.S. campaign to combat antisemitism.” According to the filing, Parscale’s company will produce “at least 100 core pieces of content per month” – including videos, audio, podcasts, graphics and text – and “5,000 derivative versions” monthly, aiming for 50 million impressions a month. Eighty percent of the content will target young Americans on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Campaign messages will be distributed via Salem Media Network, a conservative Christian media group that owns more than 200 radio stations and websites. Parscale was appointed this year to lead Salem’s strategy. Lucrative work if you can get it and don’t mind a little blood on your fangs hands. The American Conservative has more details on the Salem Media aspect of this caper: Salem Media, one of America’s largest conservative media conglomerates, may have already begun integrating paid-for Israeli government narratives across its extensive network of platforms. The arrangement, formalized through a seven-figure contract, raises significant questions about the intersection of foreign influence on an increasingly fracturing conservative media environment. Salem did not respond to The American Conservative’s request for comment. In September, the Israeli government retained Salem Media’s chief strategy officer, Brad Parscale, to advocate for Israeli interests through a $6 million financial arrangement. The contract filed with the Department of Justice explicitly outlines the “integration of narrative messaging into Salem Media Network properties and aligned distribution channels” as one of its key deliverables. Salem Media operates 82 radio stations across the United States and manages high-profile websites like Townhall and RedState that serve as influential platforms in shaping conservative discourse. Salem also hosts multiple podcasts featuring prominent voices in the conservative movement. Among those programs are The Charlie Kirk Show, The Dinesh D’Souza Podcast, The Josh Hammer Show, and The Right View with Lara Trump. According to company data, the network generates 80 million monthly website page views with 37 million monthly app visits. Salem’s newsletter operation reaches 4 million active subscribers, delivering 310 million newsletters every month, and also touts 44 million “fans” on Facebook. Parscale now serves dual roles: advancing Salem’s business interests while simultaneously working as a registered and compensated foreign agent for Israel. The implications extend to Salem’s roster of prominent commentators, particularly Dinesh D’Souza and Josh Hammer, who have become central figures in an escalating debate within conservative circles about America’s relationship with Israel and role in the Middle East policy more broadly. But Parscale can’t do it all alone. Musk’s X No Longer Translating Hebrew Clearly this is a time to leave no stone unturned for Team Hasbara, so they mopped up an embarrassing detail this week, or maybe Elon Musk did it all on his own out of his sincere concern about anti-Semitism. I’ll let Grok explain: Translation from Hebrew was disabled because it often amplified inflammatory or policy-violating content, like calls for violence, to a global audience via inaccurate or literal renditions. X prioritizes free speech for opinions but limits features that exacerbate harm without… — Grok (@grok) November 16, 2025 As to why Elon Musk might think this was necessary, here’s one example translated from the Hewbrew: pic.twitter.com/yDseDDhbg2 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 TikTok Is Now a Zionist Free Speech Zone While it’s not entirely clear that a new ownership consortium including Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz have completed their takeover of TikTok (based on I don’t believe anything Trump 2.0 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant says and he’s the one saying the deal is done), what is clear is that their new Public Policy Manager, Hate Speech, Erica Mindel is on the J-O-B. Before we look at Mindel’s work, let’s review what’s been reported about the new owners, via Forbes: Software giant Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and MGX, an AI-focused investment firm established by the government of Abu Dhabi, are expected to own around 45% of the new TikTok. Silver Lake also has significant ties to the Gulf States with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. owning 5% of the VC firm. But let’s get back to Erica Mandel and her work at Tik Tok, via Mel the Village Crazy Lady: Remember that time that Congress held a billion hearings on “antisemitism on TikTok” because people were sharing videos from Gaza? Well now that Zionists own the platform, this is what their spaces sound like: https://t.co/cH2hE2pSyK pic.twitter.com/jRJqFT5EUp — Mel (@Villgecrazylady) November 18, 2025 Both videos feature a man identified as “Older Millennial” who is indulging in grossly eliminationist rhetoric like “if we leave a scrap of Palestinian DNA in Gaza…”, “if we destroy everything in Gaza what will be the loss to mankind”, and in the top video he proposed issuing “hunting licenses” to those wishing to murder Palestinians in Gaza. Cleansing Tik Tok of Pro-Palestinian Voices Lest you think Mindel has been idle, since she came on board Tik Tok no longer serves up anything in response to searches for Nick Fuentes, and is “banning users from calling the IDF “terrorists” and rolling out automated moderation that retroactively wipes posts. Users report “Free Palestine” comments disappearing in real time and Israeli war-crimes videos taken down” per Drop Site News. Glenn Greenwald spoke to Guy Christensen, an American advocate for Gaza and Tik Tokker with 3.5 million followers on the platform about the new Hasbara regime on the site. The 19-year-old Christensen explains that prior to October 7, 2023, he was a non-political poster on the platform with over 2 million followers when “my feed was flooded with pro-Israel propaganda dehumanizing Palestinians. And me having no prior knowledge about Israel was shocked. I was disgusted by what I was hearing, not like not knowing anything. And, that shock provoked me to dig into the reality of Gaza.” Christensen was “disenrolled” from Ohio State University in May after completing his freshman year. The univeristy claimed it “received ‘myriad communications’ from ‘members of the university community’ expressing their ‘fear of violence and for their personal safety based on (Christensen’s) social media posts.’ Christensen blames Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic Congressman Richie Torres, among others, for driving his expulsion. The ACLU has taken up Christensen’s cause in a lawsuit. But back to our topic, regarding the new Tik Tok policies Christensen says: They mandate that people have to condemn terrorist groups designated by the US State Department, when mentioned in any videos, even when mentioned in a neutral, investigative context. They opened the door to classifying anti-Israel speech as hate speech based on their new clause about national origin. They ban the reading of manifestos. They restrict videos from the feed that show videos from war, aka Gaza. And so I’ve been forced and other people have been forced to stop showing real footage, real imagery from the destruction of the Palestinian nation in the Gaza Strip. As soon as these uh changes went into effect, my videos started getting banned or removed from the recommendation feed left and right. And to kind of put this into perspective, over the last, you know, almost 2 years before these changes, as I was posting consistently about Palestine every single day, there’s only been a handful of videos that I’ve ever gotten removed. I looked and over the last year prior to September 13th, it was one or two that you could even count. So very quickly (after the new policies were implemented) I racked up about 10 violations either (videos) removed completely without any recourse to appeal or they were shadowbanned. I would get like um 100 views from people who only went directly to my profile to view it and my fellow collaborators fellow people in the movement on TikTok, I reached out to them and they reported back the same exact thing. Many accounts other than Christensen’s, including Breaking Points Krystal Ball, have been throttled, banned, or shadowbanned on Tik Tok since Mindel took over “hate speech” on the platform. No one is even bothering to pretend that Chinese manipulation of the algorithm, the ostensible reason the platform was banned by the U.S. Congress, was really a concern. Rather the Washington Post handwrings about the 17-to-1 preponderance of pro-Palestinian videos vs pro-Israel videos on the platform. The hasbara happens out in the open now. The Ellisons Have Been Busy Hasbara Elves at Paramount Since I last updated about David Ellison (Larry’s nepo-baby) and Paramount, the team has been busy cracking down on free speech. Per Variety: An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. … Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. [Update, Nov. 7: Other sources intimately familiar with Paramount said that while an itemized list does not exist, the management team shares a set of values and has no desire to work with anyone who expresses hate in public and damaging ways]. Bari Weiss’ takeover at CBS News is also getting press, from Puck at the end of October: she has had real discussions about the feasibility of their transfer. Her targets have included Fox News anchors Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer, and Dana Perino, as well as CNN analyst Scott Jennings; and, as I reported earlier this week, she has also discussed expanding Anderson Cooper’s role at the network beyond 60 Minutes. In an industry where talent acquisition has its own set rules of engagement, Bari’s instinctive and freewheeling approach has struck many as unorthodox. To many TV news veterans, it is also seen as a sign of her inexperience and lack of managerial finesse. Network executives lock their talent into yearslong contracts—Anderson’s runs through 2026, Bret’s into 2028, and Dana’s into the 2030s—and include specified negotiation windows that don’t open until the final three to six months of the agreement. Savvier network leaders tend to re-up their stars before that window ever opens. Getting out of these contracts isn’t impossible, of course, but it doesn’t happen on a whim—and it usually requires quite a bit of discretion. The casual, D.I.Y. approach is very on brand for Bari, and presumably one of the reasons that David Ellison brought her in to disrupt the business. In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict. (On Friday, Trump sat down with Norah O’Donnell for his first interview on the network since he sued 60 Minutes.) Paramount Alone Isn’t Enough But Paramount is small beans in the overall media picture, which explains the Ellisons’ drive to acquire WBD (Warner Bros Discovery). Keep in mind, streaming has completely upended the American media business. The lumbering titans that bought up most of the nation’s TV networks and movie studios are getting pwned by Netflix and Alphabet’s YouTube. pic.twitter.com/fqYJtLxYmu — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Let’s hear from The New York Times regarding Paramount’s efforts to acquire WBD: Over the course of four weeks, Paramount made three offers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, ratcheting up the financial stakes of a deal that would reshape the media landscape. … The move essentially kicked off a public frenzy of interest from other potential suitors this week, including Comcast and Amazon. If they bid, that could pressure Paramount to further increase its offer. Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it was initiating a sale because of “the unsolicited interest of multiple parties” for both some parts and all of the company. Paramount’s first bid was for $19 a share, before moving up to $22 in late September. Paramount’s latest bid was delivered on Oct. 13, offering to pay the company’s shareholders $23.50 a share in cash and stock, according to the letter. That offer represented an 87 percent premium to Warner Bros. Discovery’s share price before its intent to make a bid for the company was first reported on in early September. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. shares closed at $20.53. A takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount would be a tectonic shift for the media industry. It would combine two of the largest Hollywood studios, Warner Bros. and Paramount, granting huge clout at the box office and putting CNN and CBS News under the same corporate umbrella, which would give the new company enormous sway over the news industry. It would combine Paramount+ and HBO Max, two of the biggest streaming services, bringing the company’s movies and shows into hundreds of millions of living rooms. According to Variety (in a report which Paramount denies), Paramount is “putting together a $71 billion bid for WBD in conjunction with funds from three Arab countries: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).” Regarding Paramount’s denial, one media insider reports: Sources familiar with the talks say the connections behind that capital did not appear on their own. Ari Emanuel has long standing ties across Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, and he publicly supported Ellison’s previous Paramount effort. Paramount issued a denial, but multiple industry sources confirmed that a holding company structure allows outside capital to participate without ever appearing on Paramount’s balance sheet. I’ve previously posted on Ari Emanuel’s involvement in the Ellisons’ acquisition of Paramount. Yahoo Finance had more on the wheeling and dealing going on in the Trump White House this week while the POTUS is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and cutting some private Trump organization deals of their own): Elon Musk, Tim Cook, golfer Bryson DeChambeau and other notables will join Ellison at a black-tie dinner held in the Saudi royal’s honor, a person familiar with the guest list tells Deadline. Earlier Tuesday, Trump met with Cristiano Ronaldo, the soccer star who recently re-upped his $200 million-a-year contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr. Ronaldo was also on the guest list for the dinner. A Variety report, citing anonymous sources, said a coalition involving Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, had formed in support of a forthcoming $71 billion bid by Paramount for WBD, which would be a notch higher than prior bids in the $60 billion-plus range. Now why would David Ellison need to go to the Gulf States to fund his hasbara? Maybe Daddy’s company Oracle is having some financial issues? Oracle Doesn’t Have Infinite Money CNBC reports that Oracle has lost one third of its market cap since September and is issuing $38 billion in debt to “finance its AI buildout”. Reuters is reporting that investor sentiment on that Oracle debt is bearish: Oracle bonds have taken a hit in recent days following a report that the cloud and artificial intelligence service provider plans to add another $38 billion to its heavy debt load to fund its AI infrastructure, according to analysts and investors. … “What’s interesting is most of the (major tech) companies are trying to sustain their (stock) buyback programs at the same time that they’re spending on capex currently and to do that, they’re actually borrowing and so they’re using debt,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The price of Oracle’s bonds maturing in 2033 with a 4.9% coupon has dipped, pushing yields up more than three basis points over the last two weeks, while the yield on its newer bonds maturing in 2032 with a 4.8% coupon has risen almost two basis points in one week, according to market participants. And The Financial Times put out a doozy of a report asserting that “Oracle’s net debt is already at 2.5 times ebitda, having more than doubled since 2021, and it’s expected to nearly double again by 2030. Cash flow is forecast to remain negative for five straight years.” The piece included several charts, including this particularly brutal one: pic.twitter.com/TTs0b2Q1Hw — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Time will tell if the Ellisons’ hasbara-promoting media empire will grow even larger, but at the moment it appears to be on the proverbial knife’s edge.

And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. Good on the younger Jews. Don’t let the old fuckers gaslight you into believing up is down. I think Nassim Taleb is right about social media being more a return to common sense and a two way debate than the programmed propaganda of traditional media. Ideas and opinions have to stand on their merits and against the opinions of others. People are freer to hold their own views on social media. Ultimately most people are reasonable, and know right from wrong. Essentially, Israel and its foreign assets are freaking out because the heretofore wildly successful color revolution In the US is being challenged. Where’s Waldo? Noting: “In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict.” Hilary. What are you doing in that group? Grifting again? Blabbering about how stupid your Columbia students were? Special cameo appearance, too, by gay icon Tim Cook. Ahhh, role models. Time to throw some to the flames. ” Time to throw some to the flames.” Or, as an unrepentant misogynist I knew once put it: “Time for a good old fashioned Auto da Fem.” Yes, if you want to do “cutting edge” deals, bin Salman is the one to see. The first thing I remember watching about the Jews in WWII when I was pretty young was the TV movie The Wall, which at the time I thought was a dramatic retelling of history, but that I now recognize as hasbara. It came out in 1982, which I’ve come to learn is about the time Israeli propaganda really kicked into high gear. My understanding (and older commenters, please correct me if I’m wrong here) is that before the 70s or so, WWII was looked upon as a great tragedy for the whole world, but not as a war specifically fought to persecute and murder Jewish people. Millions of Jews died, but many millions more Russians and Chinese did too, among others. Plenty of misery to go around. It wasn’t until a few decades after the war that Israel developed the narrative that the war was about them and their special grievances in order to justify allowing the Israeli government to get away with whatever it wanted to with impunity. Yes, Nazi Germany killed millions more of Russians in battle than Jews, but the extermination camps created by the Nazis were primarily intended for Europe’s Jewish population. WWII was not about the Jews, but it is incontrovertible that Nazi Germany attempted to exterminate all of European Jewry. Systematically rounding up a population and sending them by rail to gas chambers for extermination was an atrocity never before seen in war. That said, what Germany did to the Jews in WWII does not excuse Israel for what is has done in Gaza. Don’t forget the gays and the Romani people. They too were Nazi “untermenchen” As well as various “defective” people supposedly polluting the gene pool…. Agreed. War is hell and gives people the excuse to justify atrocities. There are no clean ones fought by ‘the rules’. There were 1 million+ Greeks ethnically cleansed from Anatolia during WWI and that’s not even on most people’s radar, and wouldn’t be on mine if not for some partial Greek heritage. Genocide against Jews in WWII wasn’t the first in history, and the current Zionist entity is proving beyond doubt that it wasn’t to be the last. But the way these various horrific events are referred to in today’s Western society is very different. Those who comprise the Zionist entity which puts out the hasbara Nat discusses, where the problem isn’t the wholesale slaughter of other human beings but the negative PR, are a psychologically damaged people. There’s a lot hanging on the terms “rail” and “gas chambers” in that statement, but it is incontrovertibly true the Nazis would have been quite happy if the Jews had all shipped off to Anywheresville as long as it wasn’t anywhere in Europe. The American genius was to genocide the indigenous populations without recourse to neither rail nor gas but nontheless providing the basic conceptual model for the subsequent Nazi experiment with Slavs, Gypsies and Jews. However, the most successful genocide in European history, ie, no survivors, is that of the Cathars whose frenzied slaughter was led by none other than that champion of the oligarchy as the governing principle of England, and by extension the US, Simon de Montfort, after whom an English university is named. Simon de Montfort, famous for his role in Parliamentary history, was a younger son of the crusader also called, Simon de Montfort. The younger Simon, being a younger son conceded the family’s French seat to his older brother, but received family support for laying at least partial claim to the title and lands of the Earl of Leicester, which the elder had had a claim to through his mother, a Beaumont. Both Simons played a part in the Magna Carta. Simon, the genocidaire and fifth earl of Leicester, was protecting his interests in 1215, and his son, the sixth earl of Leicester, was both a crusading genocidaire in Gascony, like his dad, but his brother-in-law, Henry III, was none too happy about it and, ultimately, after going on another crusade and coming home to a bit of turmoil, defeated Henry in 1264, called parliament in 1265 and promptly got himself killed at Evesham in the same year. Both men, it seems, were rat’s arses who got off on killing people with different beliefs. Very few of the 12 million Soviet civilian victims died in the battles, they were tortured, labored and starved to death unless just executed as an example. They were not collected to camps, just driven inside their churches and burned. In Belarus alone Germans erased over 600 villages completely (with their inhabitants) and partially destroyed over 5000. All and all the number of destroyed villages was over 70,000. The very concept of “lebensraum” included only the raum, not the people leben there at the time. That was only for the “Aryans”. It was a purposeful, genocidal, on-site ethnic cleansing. Under General Plan Ost, the Slavs of the Eastern Front (Poland, Ukraine, Baltics, Russia) were also intended to be exterminated, by a combination of killings, working to death and restricting their food. A small remainder were to be enslaved. In this respect, the concentration and extermination camps were laboratories for a much greater programme of Slavic extermination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost The justification claimed by Israel could be claimed by Poland and the Ukraine and Russia too…. I remember even in the early-mid 80s most WWII programs were more tilted towards the Pacific rather than European theatre. Probably because the US was pretty much solo there. I think it was the xian/born again stranglehold of the 80s that really cemented the zionazi mentality. Afterall, Reagan was a firm believer in jesus returning after jews went back to israel…so the xians can then convert or kill them all. I can’t speak for the 1970s vs. the 1980s, but I do know that by the 1990s a lot of “new” narratives about World War 2 were so entrenched, that anyone going up against them, including unwittingly, was getting blacklisted by both media and academia. Norman Finkelstein (“The Holocaust Industry”) comes to mind, but it wasn’t just hasbara-related; I recommend “History Wars” (from 1996!!) for a great summary of the scandal manufactured around the Smithsonian’s attempt to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings. Meanwhile, this apparently had not been the case in the 1960s, based on what’s in the older history books, e.g. William Shirer’s “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich”. So somewhere between the 60s and the 90s the switch must have gotten flipped. Insofar as the numbers. Nazi Germany was responsible for >20 million civilian and PoW deaths – ~18 million in the Soviet Union, including 3 of the 6 million Holocaust victims (which are hardly ever mentioned in “Holocaust literature”, by the way), plus 3 million of the non-Soviet Holocaust victims, >1 million in Poland, and at least hundreds of thousands if not a million plus in former Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Plus French resistance and the like, so maybe the figure is closer to 25 million. But it’s not just that, it’s the shift in focus. I watched a fascinating lecture a few years ago, where a guy just took the tourist brochures at the Auschwitz museum from different eras, and compared them. The one from the 1950s was a 200 page book (!!), explaining in detail how the Nazis came to power, why they murdered >20 million people, the whole history of the Holocaust specifically, but including how German industrialists profited from it (by working to death those Jews who were not sent to the gas chambers immediately), and on and on and on. The brochure from the 2020s? Three or so large format pages with more pictures than text, the sum of which comes down to – Hitler was evil for the sake of evil, and hated Jews because he hated Jews, and exterminated 6 million of them thusly, the end. Now, it isn’t just the effect of hasbara specifically – but that’s part of it, because if you start describing German settler colonialism, someone is bound to ask the question of how Israel’s settler colonialism is different, aside from specific tactics chosen. To be sure, it isn’t all bad in Thick History Book Land (just more bad than good). But that’s not where the great majority of the populace is, hence TikTok and CBS-WB… Germany in WWII mostly observed the Geneva Conventions with regard to POWs in the West, but embarked on exterminationist policies against the Soviets. At least 1.3 million Soviets held as POWs were murdered quite apart from battle deaths. Cold War propaganda distorted narratives of WWII atrocities in general. The firebombing of Dresden (in the Soviet zone of occupation so the evidence was in Soviet custody) for example “expanded” in Soviet propaganda by an order of magnitude to 200,000 dead. For the Americans, Stalin’s crimes had to be lumped into the common basket of “totalitarianism”. Local complicity and resistance made for morally complex stories coming from France, the Netherlands, fascist Italy and Papal Rome, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and as we are all now aware, Ukraine. I think awareness of the holocaust assumed all of its contradictory parts at least from the last days of WWII, but was layered over with many salient events and retellings, including movies and books and news events. Zionists were sure they had the answer even in the 1930s. The cynical reaction of Norman Finkelstein or John Mearsheimer began to emerge in the late 20th century. Kudos for a great round-up. Timely and important. My pleasure. Been meaning to get back to this topic but Mamdani and the MAGA civil war have been eating up my slots. Ditto Sunshine. Forwarding. Ditto Ditto Much appreciated NWT! Interesting to see the name Havas Media here helping with the Hasbara effort. The current owner, Bolloré, is a far right French industrialist billionaire who’s been accumulating propaganda outlets by buying out and then transforming formerly traditionally center left or left French media over the past decade or so into bilious anti Muslim and far right French Catholic (a huge subject) outlets to manipulate French opinion. The journalists that come with the acquisitions are unionized and fight with the few legal means at their disposal (it’s a strangely regulated profession) until they eventually just quit. Havas itself was built on money generated from the cotton trade, when it was produced by slavery, first in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and after the revolution in Brazil. Dirty money seems to stain permanently. Or in Balzacian terms “Derrière chaque grande fortune se cache un crime”. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X Sure makes me wonder about the Kirk assassination. Curious for it to happen as the hasbara rubber is hitting road. Here in Michigan as in several other states genocide, the Holocaust/ Jewish genocide and Armenian genocide are required to be taught in the public schools. There is a panel to approve the content. I have written those responsible for overseeing this as well as my state legislators as well Congresswoman Tlaib’s office to suggest that the Gaza genocide be added to the program. I received no responses. I managed to get myself blocked from further posting or commenting on Substack, since this; https://johnmerryman.substack.com/p/gods-problems Given my problems are not about politics, ethnicities, or any of the social and cultural branding, but the basic conceptual foundations of Western Civ, in this case, monotheism, I don’t really have a problem with the hasbara, as it is turning the entire media system into used toilet paper and sucking the political flunkies down with it. Ask yourself, is God Spirit, or Authority? They are not synonymous….. Democracy and republicanism originated in pantheistic cultures. And here I was thinking I might be allowed to express myself on substack. Thanks for disabusing me of that fantasy. The hasbara was happening long before the ’80’s. I remember the “making the desert bloom” hasbara coming in the late ’50’s. No mention of Zionists taking inventory of the best farms in Palestine in the ’30’s and ’40’s to be acquired (stolen) after 1948. Historian Illan Pape writes about that from actual records. There was a plan, it was implemented with German efficiency and explained as something else. What was that Goebbels said about repeating a lie frequently enough? a link would be great, I did a quick search and found this but if a person knew a more relevant to comment link that would be better, not a criticism per se, but more the farther down the pilot hole, the easier to set the screw… https://www.stopthejnf.org/the-jnf-the-principal-zionist-tool-for-the-colonization-of-palestine-by-ilan-pappe/ this is from 2023, earlier might be better A useful link might be Leon Uris’ novel, “Exodus,” published in 1958. That was the year I graduated high school and I read it and loved it. So inspiring! “Exodus” the film was released in 1960. Starring …. swoon ….. Paul Newman! One of the most effective propaganda films ever. By the time I graduated college in 1962, most of my friends were seriously considering spending time on Israeli communes, to help make ‘the desert bloom.’ It was decades later that I learned about the 1948 Nakba, the expulsion of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and farms, from the reading I did after 9/11, especially a small book by I.F. Stone. Yes, with the lyrics to the Schlockmeister theme song – “This land is mine/ God gave this land to me” – written by the uber-Goyishe pop star, Pat Boone, of all people. tegnost – here is a link to an excellent overview of “Blaming the Victims”, a book published in 1988 about myths connected to the founding of Israel. https://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/28th-may-1988/28/it-takes-two-to-tell-the-truth My parents were living in the Lebanon at that time, and did volunteer relief work with Palestinian refugees. They met many who had been driven from their homes at gunpoint. They were surprised to get home and hear that the Nakba happened because Arab leaders had broadcast instructions to Palestinians to flee their homes. That’s one of the myths addressed in the essay. It may be that since the Zionists took over Tik Tok, that it will just become another Bluesky meaning an echo chamber which the kids will just abandon. There may even be lingering resentment by those kids how their Tik Tok was taken off them and just become another Hasbara outlet courtesy of the government. The Zionists may have taken over CBS News too but when you get down to it, how many kids gets their info from CBS News in the first place? I would have figured their audience to be a much older cohort. So what will the Zionists do? Sure they will try to make all those atrocity videos be disappeared down a Memory Hole but I would not be surprised if they eventually tried to convince people that all those atrocity videos are just AI videos and that nothing ever happened. It’s all the work of Hamas don’tcha know? The civilization gods are bigger than the tribal gods. Even if the tribal gods ruled for hundreds of thousands of years and the civilization gods for only the least several thousand. The Golden Rule is a better long term strategy than Kill all the Amaleks, because what goes round, comes round. This is close to my thinking on how this will play out. The fact the Israeli system and friends are resorting to it while otherwise digging a deeper hole adds to a theory of mine: When the Israelis got a Jewish state, most of them rapidly traded in the proverbial “yiddishe kop”. On a related note, I think there’s an even deeper reason it won’t work, and I’ve been surprised that nobody else seems to have expressed it yet. For several reasons, I don’t post much on Gaza and Israel, but I think almost everyone is misdiagnosing why youth support for Israel, especially in the US, is collapsing. Gaza has definitely accelerated things, and also stripped away much of the Jewish claim to special treatment after the Holocaust. But the clouds could part tomorrow, the Palestinians and Israelis could make peace, with everything between them forgiven… and all but the most clueless younger American would carry on a simmering ill will towards Israel. Gaza is not the prime mover. The deeper rupture is only now presenting openly, still jumbled up and expressed in inchoate ways, but to put it simply, a blood debt has been incurred. America vis-a-vis Israel, regardless of how Israel justifies it in its own interests. This has nothing to do with anti-Semitic bigotry (though some will make tactical alliances and unfortunately many may drift into it). All one has to do is look at any American political issue in my lifetime that touched on “our future”, then ask which side the Israeli body politic actively enabled. New owners trying to buy up or cut down media channels as quick as they spring up is Sisyphean enough. Beyond any platform though, people in this country will keep the score in their own lives, and all but the most irredeemable suckers will conclude that Israel treats the average American as an enemy. And someday America will return the favor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnJucRfS_ig Nah man, my mom’s on woowoo. > my mom’s on woowoo. LOL #ExactlyThis Thanks again Nat, for this breakdown! @allbrt: I wwas wondering where in the hierarchy of visited sites TikTok sits … • According to semrush.com, TikTok is not even in the Top 20 in the United States. It’s 16th if you open up to the entire globe. • Across multiple stat tracking entities, TikTok settles somewhere around 17th in popularity. So I guess #T3amZ10ni5M paid a whole lotta money to get the 17th to 20-something-th most popular site to push their propaganda … FWIW, a lot of the content making waves in on YT now. YouTube, by comparison, in #2. I was going to mention how most of that top 20 was generic or shopping related, so not that relevant in shaping opinions….. but then I noticed that DDG is now bigger than either Twitter (X) or Bing!!! When did that happen? And Yahoo is somehow still alive!?! (these days, I’ll take whatever glimmers of hope I can find : ) I was surprised as well. I guess one may want to filter to social network sites since that’s where the Hasbara is focused. YouTube is not technically a social-networking site, but since the rise of its Shorts, I think you kinda have to include it since Tik-Tok exists basically as a short-video site. If we change the filter to global (so Tik-Tok shows up in the top 20), and filter out non-social-networking sites, you get: Site – Visits YouTube – 49B Facebook – 10B Instagram – 6B Reddit – 5B X – 4B Tik-Tok – 2B So the 6th largest Social Networking presence globally, but 25 times less visits than YT, and 5 times less than FB. Some big Boomer/GenX energy still out there … LOL #MyMomsOnWooWoo Why would Arab states want to fund hasbara? And famously, Smotrich said it might be moral to starve 2 million Palestinians. That might sound unfriendly, but don’t you dare compare him to that moustache guy. He only said 2 million instead of 6 million, so it’s not the same thing at all. https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/middleeast/israeli-minister-smotrich-starve-gazans-intl/ Kind of in the same spirit, I can’t help but notice how much Matt Taibbi seems to have realized who his (heftily paying audience – at least for Substack – $10/month!) really is. https://www.racket.news/p/the-jeffrey-epstein-story-is-beginning So now the whole Epstein affair is another Russiagate. Whatever keeps those new right-wing subscribers clicking and paying, I guess? Though his deterioration, moral and professional, has been apparent for years now, it’s still sad. Once upon a time, he was a good reporter. Of all these, I think the TikTok thing will be most effective. I’d guess that very few young ‘uns will dump TikTok over this as it won’t affect their main usage needs (dances or whatever they are up to). So TikTok will continue, just without informing the kids about the Zionist genocide. Sure, some will follow it by other means but a lot will just slip back into ignorance.

Please reload this page. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page. Hero Subtitle: The Heroes who brought you Internet Privacy Terminal: man cypherpunks These are the heroes that built the tools to protect us all. They showed that cryptography is a quiet declaration of freedom. The tools we rely on today came from those who refused to accept that freedom and privacy were negotiable. They built the infrastructure of independence, and in doing so, gave us a free world. Cryptography is a declaration. The people in these halls built systems that defied states. They wrote code when cryptography was treated as contraband. They stood for individual rights long before most understood that a battle was underway. They are the quiet heroes we never deserved. "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and we're going to write it." - Eric Hughes We remember them, and we thank them, for the freedoms their code made possible, and for the ones it allows us to defend. The fathers of freedom understood they were in a world ruled by law but governed by control. They knew that without privacy, freedom was theater. So they built tools no one else understood, that would become the arsenal of the free. John Gilmore ⭐ - Visionary co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), he championed digital privacy and fought government surveillance through landmark activism and litigation. Instrumental in launching the Cypherpunks mailing list, he fostered a global community dedicated to advancing cryptography and resisting censorship. Gilmore was a key supporter of the GNU Project, free software, and open encryption, and his iconic phrase, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it", encapsulates the cypherpunk ethos of resilience and decentralization. His advocacy for strong cryptography and opposition to export controls helped shape the legal and technical landscape for privacy tools. Wikipedia Perry Metzger ⭐ - Co-founder of the Cypherpunks mailing list, he catalyzed the global exchange of ideas on privacy, digital cash, and anonymous communication, directly influencing the development of remailers and practical cryptographic tools. An early advocate for strong encryption, he bridged theoretical cryptography and real-world implementation, providing technical infrastructure and thought leadership that helped shape the cypherpunk movement's pragmatic approach to digital freedom, censorship resistance, and privacy-by-design. American Scientist They took math too pure to weaponize and did it anyway, proving that ideas can defend people and laying the foundations for all cypherpunks. They refused to let banks be the gatekeepers of freedom. They turned cryptography into money and math into trust. The world called it digital currency. They called it independence. They took the promise of cryptography and made it run at scale. Code became infrastructure. Privacy became practical. Every packet encrypted became a quiet act of resistance, that just works. They knew the risks and spoke anyway. They paid in freedom to show us the truth. The Translators. They built the culture that made privacy a cause instead of a feature. The Courtroom Warriors. They battled the state on its own turf. They translated code into arguments and turned resistance into precedent. They built nations of the mind. From ideals to infrastructure, they mapped the blueprint for digital civilization itself, redefining the social contract, designing systems where citizenship, governance, and value flow across networks, not borders. The Foundation. Before cypherpunks, there were the pioneers who built the substrate of freedom itself. They designed the OS layer that made the rest possible. Everything began with them. Complex Legacies. Builders who carried the mission forward through the system and sometimes against it. Not without controversy, andn ever without consequence. This hall will never be complete. The fight for privacy doesn't end, it evolves. Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight, someone is writing code to protect people they'll never meet. Someone is proving that technology can serve freedom. if (you.value_privacy) { cypherpunk(you); } The people in this hall showed us that cryptography is freedom. They proved that a few determined keyboard warriors with conviction can become the greatest heroes of the free world. You're next. Infrastructure for freedom. Code for sovereignty. These projects are weapons bringing both freedom of speech and defense against surveillance. They're proof that decentralized systems can work. They're the infrastructure layer of digital freedom. Because when you write code that liberates people, you’re programming the future. liberation() The mathematical breakthroughs that made everything else possible. These are the protocols that turned cryptography from an academic curiosity into a tool for mass liberation. The Anonymity Layer. Privacy requires anonymity. These projects hide who you are, who you're talking to, and what you're saying. I2P (Invisible Internet Project) - Anonymous overlay network enabling censorship-resistant communication, I2P employs garlic routing to bundle multiple encrypted messages, enhancing metadata resistance beyond traditional onion routing. It powers privacy-preserving hidden services, anonymous browsing, secure email, decentralized file sharing, and peer-to-peer applications, fostering a robust ecosystem for activists, journalists, and users seeking digital freedom. By decentralizing infrastructure and resisting surveillance, it advances cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Wikipedia Mixmaster / Mixminion - Pioneered anonymous email communication by introducing the second- and third-generation anonymous remailer protocols, enabling users to send messages without revealing their identity or metadata. Mixmaster implemented fixed-size packets and layered onion encryption, thwarting traffic analysis and enhancing privacy. Mixminion advanced the design with improved reply blocks and more robust delivery, setting a technical precedent for metadata-resistant messaging and influencing later anonymity networks like Tor. These protocols embodied cypherpunk ideals by empowering individuals to communicate securely and anonymously, resisting surveillance and censorship. Wikipedia The Toolbox. Practical encryption tools that protect files, messages, and communications from surveillance. LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) - Provides the de facto standard for Linux full-disk encryption, enabling robust protection of sensitive data at rest. By introducing a secure metadata header supporting multiple key slots, LUKS allows for flexible key management and secure password changes without re-encryption. Managed via cryptsetup, it is integrated into nearly all major Linux distributions, empowering users to control their own cryptographic keys and resist unauthorized access. LUKS embodies cypherpunk values by democratizing strong encryption, making privacy and digital autonomy accessible to millions of users and organizations worldwide. Wikipedia dm-crypt - Enables robust, transparent block-level encryption within the Linux kernel, empowering users to secure entire disks or partitions against unauthorized access. As the foundational engine beneath LUKS, it supports advanced cipher modes like XTS-AES, ensuring strong cryptographic protection for sensitive data at rest. Widely adopted in privacy-centric distributions and by security professionals, it exemplifies cypherpunk principles by making strong, open source encryption accessible to all, directly countering surveillance and data theft. Its integration into mainstream operating systems has made full-disk encryption a practical default, advancing digital autonomy and resistance to coercive data disclosure. Wikipedia The Infrastructure. Without these systems, privacy tools couldn't exist. Open source operating systems that can be audited, verified, and trusted. The Building Blocks. Cryptographic libraries that developers use to build secure applications. Easy to use correctly, hard to misuse. LibreSSL - Provides a security-hardened, open source alternative to OpenSSL, created by the OpenBSD team in response to the catastrophic Heartbleed vulnerability. LibreSSL aggressively removes legacy code, modernizes cryptographic primitives, and enforces rigorous code auditing, reducing attack surface and improving reliability for privacy-critical applications. Its focus on transparency, minimalism, and open development directly advances cypherpunk goals of trustworthy, decentralized security infrastructure, powering secure communications in privacy tools, servers, and embedded systems. Wikipedia BoringSSL - Delivers a hardened, modern fork of OpenSSL designed to minimize attack surface and eliminate legacy vulnerabilities, powering secure communications in Chrome, Android, and Cloudflare. By removing outdated algorithms, tightening default security settings, and focusing on robust cryptographic primitives, it advances the cypherpunk goal of widespread, reliable encryption for billions of users. Its rigorous code review and proactive security stance set a new standard for open source cryptographic libraries, directly supporting privacy and digital freedom at global scale. Wikipedia Noise Protocol Framework - Enables the creation of secure, privacy-preserving communication protocols by defining modular cryptographic handshake patterns like Noise_NN and Noise_XX, which combine Diffie-Hellman key exchange and authenticated encryption (AEAD) for robust confidentiality and forward secrecy. Widely adopted in privacy-focused tools such as WireGuard and the Lightning Network, it empowers decentralized, censorship-resistant networks by making strong cryptography accessible and auditable, embodying cypherpunk principles of user autonomy and digital freedom. Wikipedia Modern Cypherpunk Privacy Layer. Selected for transparency, independence, and avoidance of telemetry or ad-tech ties. These VPNs represent privacy-first infrastructure. Money Without Middlemen. From theoretical concepts to working systems, these projects proved that value can be exchanged without institutions controlling the flow. DigiCash - Invented truly private digital payments by implementing blind signatures, enabling users to withdraw and spend e-cash tokens that banks could verify but not trace, thus separating identity from transaction history. DigiCash's architecture provided a practical demonstration of anonymous, cryptographically secure electronic cash, directly influencing the design of later cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and foundational privacy concepts in digital finance. Its legacy endures as a blueprint for privacy-preserving money and a milestone in the cypherpunk quest for digital freedom. Wikipedia b-money - Pioneered the concept of decentralized digital currency by outlining a system for electronic cash using a public, distributed ledger, proof-of-work mining, and cryptographically enforced contracts in b-money. Introduced mechanisms for digital scarcity, anonymous transactions, and consensus without trusted intermediaries, directly inspiring the design of Bitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies. Cited by Satoshi Nakamoto as foundational, it advanced cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship by envisioning money as a protocol, not an institution. Wikipedia bit gold - Established a decentralized digital currency concept by chaining proof-of-work puzzles with timestamped public registries, enabling trustless, verifiable ownership of digital assets without intermediaries. bit gold directly inspired the architecture of Bitcoin, introducing core ideas like distributed consensus, scarcity enforced by computation, and resistance to censorship. Its design anticipated blockchain's role in privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer value transfer, making it a foundational milestone in cypherpunk efforts to undermine centralized control over money and empower individual autonomy. Wikipedia Hashcash - Introduced the concept of proof-of-work to combat email spam by requiring senders to compute a SHA-based hash collision, thereby imposing a computational cost on bulk messaging and deterring abuse. Its elegant challenge - response mechanism became foundational for decentralized trustless systems, directly inspiring the mining process and consensus protocol of Bitcoin and influencing later privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. By demonstrating how cryptographic puzzles could enable resistance to censorship and Sybil attacks without central authorities, it advanced core cypherpunk ideals of autonomy, privacy, and digital freedom. Hashcash's legacy endures in modern anti-spam tools, blockchain security, and the architecture of decentralized digital cash. Wikipedia Breaking the Cloud Monopoly. Distributed systems that don't rely on centralized servers or corporate infrastructure. The Security Stack. The protocols and systems that make secure communication possible at Internet scale. DNSCrypt - Secures the typically unencrypted DNS lookup process by authenticating and encrypting queries between users and resolvers, thwarting interception, censorship, and surveillance by ISPs or adversaries. Utilizes modern cryptography, notably X25519 for key exchange, to ensure forward secrecy and integrity. By pioneering practical deployment of encrypted DNS before widespread adoption of DNS-over-HTTPS, it empowered individuals to reclaim privacy at a fundamental layer of internet communication, embodying cypherpunk principles of decentralization and resistance to surveillance. Wikipedia OTR (Off-the-Record Messaging) - Cryptographic protocol pioneering both perfect forward secrecy and deniability in real-time chat, it ensures that messages are encrypted and authenticated during transmission but cannot be proven to originate from a specific user after the conversation ends. By introducing these properties to instant messaging, it set a new standard for secure communications, directly influencing the design of modern protocols like Signal and inspiring broader adoption of ephemeral, privacy-preserving messaging. Its open source reference implementation and protocol specification have empowered activists, journalists, and privacy advocates worldwide to communicate securely, embodying cypherpunk ideals of decentralization and user autonomy. Wikipedia The Movement Infrastructure. Organizations and projects that defend digital rights, spread knowledge, and fight for freedom. The Origin Story. Before the term "cypherpunk" existed, these projects and manifestos laid the cultural and technical foundations. Every day, millions of people rely on these systems to communicate securely, transact privately, and resist surveillance. The next breakthrough is being built right now. Someone is writing the protocol that will obsolete everything on this list. Someone is deploying infrastructure that will protect the next generation. while (surveillance.exists()) { cypherpunks.code(); } Ship freedom. Lessons from the Fallen Not every privacy project stays true to its mission. Some were compromised. Some mysteriously shut down. Some made choices that betrayed their users' trust. This section documents projects that failed, were compromised, or can no longer be trusted. The graveyard of privacy tools teaches us as much as the Hall of Fame. "Don't trust. Verify." - Every cypherpunk who learned the hard way These services chose death over betrayal by choosing to shut down rather than backdoor their users. They deserve respect. These services were compromised, backdoored, blacklisted or taken over by law enforcement. They cannot be trusted. These services made architectural choices or policy decisions that fundamentally compromise user privacy. Privacy tools that were acquired by companies with different incentives. Every compromised project teaches us something: The only trusted system is one you can audit yourself, running on hardware you control or can remote attest and verify, using open protocols that can't be backdoored. Build systems that can't betray their users, even if the developers want to. Built with significant effort, in respect for those who put significantly more effort into the tools we use to stay free. Privacy is freedom. In crypto we trust. Cypherpunks Hall of Fame There was an error while loading. Please reload this page. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

Title: SpaceX: AST SpaceMobile's EU Satellite Plans Raise 'Foreign Control' Questions

In a new regulatory salvo, SpaceX is questioning whether rival AST SpaceMobile—a Texas-based satellite company—is too closely tied to Europe. Although it’s common for satellite players to criticize each other in regulatory filings, Elon Musk's company is now bringing geopolitics in the mix. In a 9-page filing, SpaceX urged the FCC to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile’s recent moves to establish a jointly owned European satellite service with British carrier Vodafone. The EU has been looking for alternatives to SpaceX's Starlink, and AST has described the project as ensuring "European sovereignty" in satellite communications. However, SpaceX is subtly suggesting that AST’s business isn’t entirely aligned with US interests. "AST’s application for a sovereign European system with an overseas 'command switch' raises fundamental interference, space sustainability, and national security concerns that require clarification and correction," SpaceX writes in its filing. AST says its satellite plans with Vodafone will include a “command switch to support European oversight and security,” providing European partners with a way to modify encryption keys for satellite communications and manage the satellite beams. In an earnings call last week, AST also indicated the satellite system for Europe will be part of the satellite constellation that serves all markets, including the US. "AST and its owners have made several claims recently that raise serious concerns about foreign control over its system," SpaceX argues. "In light of these claims, AST should clarify the extent of foreign ownership and control over its proposed system, including whether its application is more appropriately filed as a request for US market access." The FCC is currently reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite-to-phone service in the US through AT&T and Verizon. The application’s approval is crucial, especially since AST is hoping to kick off its service sometime next year. But the same system is also poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile, and can power texting, mobile apps, and video calls in dead zones. In its filing, SpaceX also claims that AST’s procedures to retire aging satellites contain “many holes,” warranting a closer look from the FCC before green-lighting the application. “To highlight just one example, AST maintains a post-mission disposal plan to barrel-roll its satellites through other satellite constellations in order to compensate for AST’s lack of adequate fuel reserves but fails to explain how it will avoid collisions during these dangerous maneuvers,” SpaceX alleges. On Tuesday, T-Mobile submitted its own filing to the FCC, urging the commission to "take no action" on AST's application until the company provides more details about how it’ll address potential radio interference with ground-based cellular networks. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a supporter of both SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. In April, he posted a video of his visit to AST’s Texas headquarters, and touted the company as a counter to China’s satellite ambitions. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

On Tuesday, T-Mobile submitted its own filing to the FCC, urging the commission to "take no action" on AST's application until the company provides more details about how it’ll address potential radio interference with ground-based cellular networks. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a supporter of both SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. In April, he posted a video of his visit to AST’s Texas headquarters, and touted the company as a counter to China’s satellite ambitions.

Title: Kyle Butler

Full Content:
Kyle Butler eats, sleeps, and breathes tattooing. The Aurora-born artist and entrepreneur has been collecting ink since he gave himself his first stick ’n’ poke at age 14 (it was the Deathwish Skateboards logo). A week after his 18th birthday, he moved to Chicago to study creative writing at Columbia College and soon began home tattooing. Two years later, he dropped out to devote himself to what had become a full-blown obsession. Now 33, he’s the sole owner of the Irving Park street shop Red Devil Tattoo, which he started with Miranda Larson in 2021, and also runs a private, appointment-only studio nearby. As tattooing moved from an underground industry to a “legitimate” trade in the late 20th century, home tattooing became frowned upon by the broader professional community. But many artists—including many industry trailblazers—had started as so-called “scratchers.” Over the past decade, home tattooing has experienced something of a renaissance thanks to the wide availability of single-use needles (an industry standard since the early 2000s) and home tattoo machines, along with the ubiquity of social media as a tool for learning and self-promotion. Butler embodies a shop owner who came from the modern underground. He remains excited about how reduced barriers to entry have led to fresh styles and ideas in tattooing. At the same time, he encourages a reverence for tattoo history and an investment in the craftsmanship (such as learning to build one’s own machines) that’s often lost to younger artists. To Butler, tattooing isn’t a trade, it’s a lifestyle—and he can’t imagine any other. I tattooed myself when I was 14. Then I got a tattoo in Indiana when I was 16 because you can get tattooed underage in Indiana, so we just drove over the [Illinois] border. Once I turned 18, I was getting tattooed all the time. I like getting tattooed. There’s something primal about it. No matter where you come from or who your ancestors are, at one point, they were tattooing themselves or marking their bodies or decorating [them]. Tattooing can be really transformative because it’s both immediate and permanent. You walk into a place one way and you walk out different. At 18, I had no inkling I was going to tattoo. I just knew I was obsessed. There’s all these ways you should go about [becoming a tattooer]: Get an apprenticeship, train, have a mentor, etc. I was way too antsy and maybe anti-authority for that. I just had to do it, so I started tattooing my friends. I dropped out of Columbia in 2015. I really liked school—like really, really—but tattooing kind of overtook all my time and energy. I lived at a big, shitty punk house with a million people; I paid, like, $200 a month in rent and split a room. That’s where a lot of my practice came: There’d be some punk band on tour who’d want to get tattoos after the show, so we’d stay up all night partying and tattooing. When I started, I wasn’t thinking of it as a hobby or a career. It felt more like a lifestyle. I just knew that I was gonna be into tattoos forever. If I was making money, if I wasn’t—there was no way I’d stop. I slowly started to get better and meet helpful people. I started to travel a lot, too. I was doing guest spots at different shops across the country. I did a couple really long trips where I packed all my tattoo stuff in my car and drove from, like, Chicago to LA, stopping and tattooing where I could—[working at] random shops where I had a friend from the Internet or a punk house where I knew people. Tattooing used to be really hard to get into. My generation no longer needs the traditional shop structure to make a career. There’s a lot of DIY, underground artists who don’t have to be legitimized in a traditional sense. Not having to go through other people to get your equipment and stuff, people are able to make a living themselves, which I think is cool. There’s bad parts about that, too. Tattooing has a really rich history and beautiful lineage. When you’re disavowing shops or the old ways in general, you’re narrowing your mind. I try to think of Red Devil as a contemporary model where it’s more people who maybe didn’t have the traditional shop apprenticeship, but we are a street shop. We do walk-ins. We’re interested in the people who’ve done it before us and carrying that [spirit] on. One of my biggest influences is [pioneering Filipino American tattooer] Leo Zulueta. I got tattooed by him right before I started tattooing. He’s sort of the godfather of modern tribalism. His style is super fast, punk rock, in-your-face-looking black work, which I’d seen out in the world, but to see it in person totally flipped my lid. The shop was set up different, like the lights were lower [than most studios] and the stuff on the walls was more anthropological photos, people from antiquity or with tattoos all over their faces—tribal tattoos from different cultures. He drew the tattoo right on [my skin] and took his time drawing, erasing, and drawing it again. It was very abstract and tailored to me. I hadn’t experienced any of that before. Sometimes I’d get tattooed at a shop and people would ice me or say something about how I was a “scratcher.” I didn’t really give a fuck. Maybe this is my stubbornness or contrariness or whatever, but if somebody told me not to do something, that made me want to do it more. It gave me a drive to get better. I still have a lot to prove. I don’t know if it’s to myself or other people, but this tattooing thing—it’s endlessly challenging. The realm of possibilities is so big I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface. Your creative and technical ability is always one step behind your vision of the future. I hadn’t put much forethought into starting a shop. I was working at my house for a few years, and then I got a job at [Rogers Park’s Fudo Tattoo], which I loved. I learned a lot from the owner, Dustin Golden. But then I started to feel antsy, and I quit and opened a private tattoo studio in this old warehouse. It was just me, and I really enjoyed it. Then I was bored of that, so I met Miranda and was like, “We should open a walk-in shop.” It was always the plan she’d eventually move back to Texas, and I’d take over. Then this past January, I opened a private studio a couple blocks from the shop. That’s a lot of places to work in ten years, but I think your environment can really dictate your creativity. Changing it is a really good way to open and close chapters of your life. When I started, I was sort of a snot-nosed punk rock kid, like, “Fuck you! I do whatever I want!” Now I have so much more respect for the people who did it before me, all of my favorite tattooers from the 70s, 80s, 90s. All the stuff they were able to accomplish pre-Internet, pre-tattoo television shows, when you had to make your own needles and pigments, and be a good craftsman—it’s unbelievable what they were able to do with the limited technology available to them. My old boss, Dustin, has been building machines since the 2000s. He was the first guy I was around who did that. I’d always struggled with machines. Being self-taught, I had to figure out all that stuff on my own. I was always trying to make them work better or fix them, only to break them and have to get something new. Dustin’s machines were the first ones I even liked. He taught me how he builds them. Having the technical knowledge to troubleshoot issues really changed my tattooing. That’s a lost art now because you can literally order anything you need to tattoo off Amazon and get it in a day. But there’s a real artfulness to getting a machine to look and sound and work exactly how you want. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle because I love people. I love talking to people and working in a city like Chicago, where everyone you tattoo is so different. Touch can be a really beautiful thing in how it connects people. Plus, people will sit in the shop all day and get tattooed next to somebody, and they’re all into it. Maybe none of them would ever have a conversation on the street, but now they’re sort of initiated into this physical, tangible blood ritual that’s quite bizarre. You walk in a grocery store or whatever, and somebody comments on your tattoo—that’s a bridge, too. I still love tattooing as much as when I started. I still get giddy [like] I did when I was 14, tattooing myself in my house. There’s something about it that is so potent to me. It hasn’t lost any of its magic.

Michael Burry is warning of an AI bubble, pointing to a chart showing U.S. capex-to-GDP ratios hitting levels last seen before the dot-com and housing crashes. He says tech capex is rising at double-digit rates while AI stocks sit near record highs, a pattern where markets peak before spending does. His Lord of the Rings meme mocks investor complacency. Burry has reportedly taken large put positions against Nvidia and Palantir and even deregistered Scion, signaling he expects inflated AI valuations, excess capacity, and margin risks to trigger a correction.

Title: European shares stabilise as investors await Nvidia report

Time Published: 2025-11-19T17:33:44Z

Global shares stabilised somewhat on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s earnings report after the markets closed in the US, an update that analysts say could set the tone for the rest of 2025. Dublin Recovering some of Tuesday’s 2.3 per cent slide, the Iseq index closed up 1.5 per cent, outperforming other European indices. Bank stocks rallied and regained some momentum. AIB advanced by 1.7 per cent to close at €8.27 per share. Bank of Ireland finished the session at €14.97 per share, some 0.5 per cent higher, while PTSB added 0.3 per cent to close at €3.20. Home builders Cairn Homes and Glenveagh added 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent to finish off at €1.92 and €1.82 respectively as the latest property price index showed Irish house price inflation continuing to hover around the 8 per cent mark in September. Europe European shares were largely unchanged after hovering near a more than one-month low for a time on Wednesday. Both the blue-chip Stoxx 50 index and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by just 0.1 per cent, with the latter coming off its single biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. European tech stocks declined and then rebounded somewhat in advance of Nvidia’s all-important earnings report that could stoke or soothe investor worries about sky-high tech valuations. AI hardware maker Schneider Electric finished 0.3 per cent higher, while Siemens added 0.2 per cent and chipmaker ASML surged 2.4 per cent in choppy trading. Meanwhile, Kering lost 3.2 per cent after the luxury company’s boss Luca de Meo said a return to growth will require reducing its reliance on struggling flagship Gucci, according to a memo seen by Reuters. London The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index slid for a fifth consecutive session, losing 0.4 per cent, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was little changed at closing bell. UK inflation slowed down for the first time since May in October, offering relief to the Labour Party government before next week’s annual budget and boosting the chance of a rate cut by the Bank of England. Consumer-focused stocks like Unilever, up 0.4 per cent, put a floor under the declines. British American Tobacco, meanwhile, jumped by more than 1 per cent while JD Sports added 4.4 per cent and Primark owner Associated British Foods moved 0.8 per cent higher. Bank stocks dragged on the index, however, with Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds logging losses of between 0.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. New York Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday in advance of the Nvidia report, clawing back some ground lost during the earlier sell-off this week as investors repositioned their AI and tech bets. The Nasdaq Composite moved 0.6 per cent higher, the S&P 500 advanced by 0.3 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Chipmaker Nvidia climbed 2 per cent, leaving shares of the most important stock on Wall Street down almost 9 per cent this month. The AI darling has come to represent the nascent artificial intelligence technology that has powered much of the stock market’s rally in recent months. Its quarterly results and forward guidance will be scrutinised to determine how much life remains in the AI boom and whether worries over inflated valuations and a potential AI bubble are warranted. A basket tracking the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple and Meta, advanced 0.9 per cent. Alphabet surged as much as 7 per cent, its biggest gain since September, amid a wave of glowing reviews of the new version of its Gemini AI model. Target slipped 0.1 per cent after the retail giant trimmed its profit forecast for the year.

Title: Nvidia shares set for $300bn swing around high-stakes earnings

Nvidia investors are bracing for a roughly $300 billion (€260 billion) swing in market value following quarterly results on Wednesday, amid rising unease over Silicon Valley’s vast spending on artificial intelligence. Options markets imply traders are expecting the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker’s share price to move by an average of 6.4 per cent in either direction when markets open on Thursday, equivalent to a gain or loss of about $280 billion in value. Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company at the end of October but since then has been caught up in a sharp stock market sell-off led by big AI players that has dragged the chipmaker’s shares down 11 per cent. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist, said: “The angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable.” The California-based company’s critical role in the AI boom means its results have in recent years heavily influenced the direction and mood of the broader tech-dominated US stock market. Wednesday’s results arrive as investors’ enthusiasm for the AI boom appears to be on the wane, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down more than 4 per cent over the past five sessions. [ Concerns mounting that we are well into market-bubble territoryOpens in new window ] Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have been among those hardest hit by the recent bout of selling, with Meta down 19 per cent and Oracle down 20 per cent over the past month. Mike Zigmont, co-head of trading at Visdom Investment Group, said: “In the run-up to Nvidia’s earnings announcement, we’re experiencing cold feet and worry that prices went too high to justify.” “If Nvidia delivers disappointing guidance Wednesday, the [market] is going to sink significantly,” he added. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue of about $55.5 billion on Wednesday, according to Visible Alpha data, above the company’s prior guidance in August of roughly $54 billion. The company is also expected to forecast its revenue for the current quarter, which analysts estimate will be about $62 billion, up roughly 58 per cent year-on-year. Nvidia has consistently beaten predictions over recent quarters, ratcheting up expectations that it will outperform again. Chief executive Jensen Huang in October announced the company had secured $500 billion in revenue for the next five quarters, at the high end of Wall Street estimates, helping the company temporarily surpass a record $5 trillion market valuation. Nvidia has been buffeted by volatile trade relations between China and the US this year. A rally in its shares last month was boosted by hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough. But the future of its AI chip sales in China remains uncertain, caught between US export controls and a push from Beijing to build more chips at home. Nvidia has in recent months signed multibillion-dollar deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, outside investors and rival tech groups to build data centres that use its chips to run AI models. Analysts have drawn attention to the circularity of some of these agreements, which often involve suppliers, investors and customers of the same handful of companies. Big Tech groups have also recently made greater use of public and private debt markets to fund their spending on AI infrastructure, which they had previously largely paid for with cash. Nvidia and Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic, whose chatbot Claude is a major competitor to OpenAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Inside the California 'AI factory' that showcases the contradiction at the heart of the tech race

Google's ultra-private CEO Sundar Pichai is showing me around Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun. But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. "AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on," he insists. "It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions." But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a "sudden correction" in global financial markets, saying "market valuations appear stretched" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that "there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now". Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: "I think no company is going to be immune, including us." So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these "inflection points": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. "Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence." But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is "palpably exciting" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: "It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… "So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this." Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: "restricted". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term "AI factories" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: "I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: "If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough." He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. "I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies," he said. But he also said: "What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure." Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. "I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true," he told me. "Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it." But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: "truth matters". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? "I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. "You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy," he adds. "I think that will have consequences." Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.

Title: AI Slop Has Turned Social Media Into an Antisocial Wasteland

Commentary: Platforms that once helped us stay in touch have become fractured and impersonal -- and AI slop and deepfakes are making it so much worse. Social media is becoming more unbearable, thanks to AI. Social media has never been lauded for realism, but online deceit is reaching a fever pitch. Since the inception of platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, aspirational content has flooded our feeds with too-perfect bodies, homes and lifestyles. Despite the supposed aim of social media to keep us connected, going online increasingly feels isolating and detached from reality. AI slop and deepfakes are making it infinitely worse. The emergence of generative AI tools like OpenAI's Sora, Google's Veo and Midjourney has facilitated the creation of videos that are all at once extraordinary, imaginative and deceptive. Suddenly, a simple text prompt can conjure anything you think up. It's a technological marvel, and, oftentimes, an ethical nightmare. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. AI slop refers to the endless barrage of low-quality digital content created with artificial intelligence. You've likely seen examples of this on your social media feeds, from videos of animals exhibiting oddly human characteristics to pranks and gags that seem to defy the laws of physics. In addition, deepfakes of public figures, both alive and dead, saying and doing things that never actually happened have become a hot -- and contentious -- commodity. It's not just shoddy AI that's diminishing the online experience. Filtering through more convincing fabrications of people, places and events demands more vigilance than ever, and it's utterly exhausting. Ever since the rollout of OpenAI's Sora app in September, I've wondered why anyone would want to scroll through a feed made up solely of artificial moments. Even more "traditional" social platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become inundated with AI content that seemingly serves no real purpose, beyond demonstrating the astonishingly lifelike imagery that AI tools can now conjure in an instant. Isn't the point of social media to stay in touch with people you know and to follow public figures that interest you? Is that foundational objective officially dead? "The cynical answer is that social media is now aimed at keeping you connected to the tool, rather than to each other," said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of Cornell Tech's Security, Trust and Safety Initiative. Tech giants are "making their stock price go up" by showing off their AI capabilities, he said, but "it's coming at the expense of the experience on these platforms." Indeed, that heightened artificiality clashes with the authenticity many of us seek and increasingly struggle to find online. One of the reasons I fell in love with TikTok years ago is that it's easier to find more genuine, unfiltered content -- a welcome relief from the overly polished influencer posts flooding my Instagram feed, although I increasingly see my fair share of that on TikTok, too. Even before the rise of generative AI, Instagram updates from friends and family have largely been supplanted by content from high-profile creators I don't follow. That's not always a bad thing, as it often exposes me to topics I want to see more of. That focus on user interests is what makes TikTok's algorithm in particular so powerful (and addictive). But it makes me feel even more disconnected from the people I actually do know -- especially since everyday folks are seemingly posting less nowadays. Factor AI into that equation, and any semblance of authenticity fades away. Now, along with battling feelings of insecurity from seeing touched-up images of real people, you may also stumble upon vacation photos that are entirely AI-generated, or come across an AI influencer that amplifies unattainable beauty standards. "Before, we had the problem of unrealistic body expectations," Mantzarlis said. "And now we're facing the world of unreal body expectations." It's becoming harder for people to separate fact from fiction, but the dissemination of slop and deepfakes isn't slowing down. The clock is ticking for platforms to regulate this new wave of content before it drowns out our sense of reality. Social media companies like Meta and TikTok have pledged to label AI-generated content and ban harmful posts such as fake crisis events or the use of private individuals' likenesses without their permission. On Wednesday, TikTok said it'll start testing a new control for people to choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their feeds. Pinterest rolled out a similar feature last month. But in the absence of government regulation -- which is lagging due to factors like political gridlock over how to regulate AI, lobbying from tech firms (Meta recently launched a super PAC to push back on AI laws) and the rapid rate at which the technology is evolving -- it's up to companies to uphold their own policies. It can admittedly be tricky for sites to flag everything given the sheer volume of content, but so far, their perfunctory efforts don't seem very promising. That lack of regulation can magnify distrust and discord online. An August study by Raptive, a media company that works with digital creators, found that when people merely suspected content was AI-generated, they instinctively distanced themselves from it. Specifically, 48% of respondents found the content to be less trustworthy, while 60% said they felt a lower emotional connection to it. But with influencer-created content dominating most social platforms these days, AI can be marketed as a way to simplify a traditionally time-consuming process. "AI tools make it easier for more people to be creators," said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at Raptive. "It increases the footprint of who can be a creator much faster." Chatting with Bannister helped to offset a bit of my skepticism; he reminded me that "like any new technology, there are always good and bad uses." Along with AI slop, he noted, there's still human creativity behind the (oftentimes ridiculous) AI content we see online. "There will be lots of junk and bumps in the road and problems, but maybe this can create amazing new forms of information-sharing and entertainment," Bannister said. "There's still so much junk flowing through the system that we don't know what that outcome is going to be." There's another side to what AI is capable of: "It's going to be used for further exacerbating tensions, for confirming people's pre-existing biases," Mantzarlis said. Social media is already an echo chamber for reaffirming people's harmful, close-minded viewpoints and rapidly spreading misinformation. I'm not sure we're prepared for just how much worse that can get when everyone has the power to easily manufacture their own reality and share it with the world. The fracturing of society is only going to show wider cracks. If anything, I'd appreciate it if more platforms gave us the option to dial down how much AI we see on our feeds. Though given the choice, I'd dial it all the way down to zero.

Joint venture to deliver up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030, starting with a 100 MW deployment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to power the Global AI ecosystem with cost-efficient, high-performance infrastructure News Summary WASHINGTON, D.C. – November 19, 2025 – AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN, a PIF company delivering global full-stack AI solutions, announced today plans to establish a joint venture aimed to support the development of Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading provider of world-class AI solutions for regional and global customers. AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN will serve as founding investors in the joint venture, which is expected to begin operations in 2026 with plans to combine HUMAIN’s state-of-the-art data centers with AMD and Cisco technology, delivering modern data center capacity with efficient power and lower capital expenditures. AMD and Cisco will act as exclusive technology partners to the joint venture, contributing their portfolio of products and services to its development of up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030. The companies also announced the first phase of the project as a buildout of 100 MW AI infrastructure, with the intent to include HUMAIN modern data center capacity, AMD Instinct™ MI450 Series GPUs and Cisco’s industry-leading critical infrastructure. Powering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s AI Driven Economy Earlier this year, Cisco and AMD announced a landmark initiative with HUMAIN to help build the world’s most open, scalable, resilient and cost-efficient AI infrastructure. Today’s announcement advances this partnership with plans for a joint venture to accelerate transformation and provide cost-effective infrastructure to power customers’ AI use cases. Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO of AMD, said: “Delivering high-performance global AI infrastructure at scale requires strong partnerships. Together with HUMAIN and Cisco, we’re combining leadership compute and networking technologies to expand the capacity and global competitiveness of the Kingdom’s AI ecosystem. As part of this deepening collaboration, we’re also establishing an AMD Center of Excellence in Saudi Arabia to further accelerate local integration and innovation.” Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO of Cisco said: “Our expanded partnership with HUMAIN, together with AMD, will mark a pivotal moment in accelerating Saudi Arabia’s AI infrastructure. By providing secure, scalable, critical infrastructure for HUMAIN’s up to 1 GW buildout, Cisco will help the Kingdom turn its vision for a digitally advanced, AI-powered economy into a reality.” Tareq Amin, CEO of HUMAIN said: “Our partnership with AMD and Cisco brings world-class technology and expertise to our mission. Together, we are pushing the frontier of AI compute, bringing up to 1 GW of high-performance, cost-efficient infrastructure online in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to empower innovators both in the Kingdom and around the world.” The collaboration reflects the ambition to create a dynamic, AI-driven economy. Cisco’s latest AI Readiness Index shows that while 91% of Saudi organizations plan to deploy AI agents, only 29% currently have robust GPU capacity, highlighting the urgent need for advanced data center infrastructure. These findings point to an urgent need for the scalable, high-performance AI infrastructure which AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN are building together. The collaboration is not only expected to deliver the compute capacity required for AI at scale but also strengthens the foundations of Saudi Arabia’s digital economy, supporting goals to localize innovation, talent, and technology.

Title: Nvidia’s earnings could answer the AI bubble question and upend global markets in moment of truth for Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/19/nvidia-earnings-artificial-intelligence-magnificent-seven-apple-stocks-investors-guide/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom.

Title: Cloudflare Outage Just Made Everyone Paranoid: But Blockchain Kept Working—CZ

DDoS protection giant Cloudflare just went out, paralyzing major corners of the internet. Yet, blockchain networks like Bitcoin remain resilient. Today, Cloudflare suffered a global network issue, causing major services connected to it to slow down or outright stop working. According to the website’s status tracker, it began looking into the issue around noon, UTC. Cloudflare noted it was “experiencing an internal service degradation.” Cloudflare provides a range of internet and cybersecurity-related services, being most known for its “Checking your browser…” DDoS protection page that has become a familiar sight when navigating to some popular websites. About 20% of the global traffic passes through the company, so any issues related to it can have widespread impacts. The outage today clearly showcased it, as it caused issues for thousands of users around the world. Dane Knecht, Cloudflare CTO, posted a statement on X: I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused. Some of the biggest names impacted by the issue included ChatGPT, X, Uber, and McDonald’s. Ironically, even Downdetector, a website that helps users track outages around the internet, itself went down during the event. It took Cloudflare a few hours to get the issue sorted. At 14:42 UTC, the status page reported, “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved.” There were some hiccups post this patch, but they were resolved by 17:44 UTC, as the website updated with, “We are no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.” The market initially reacted to the event, as Cloudflare’s stock dropped to $194, but once the company restored services, its price jumped back to $199. While Cloudflare was dealing with the outage, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on X: “Blockchain kept working.” The remark highlighted the fact that even when 20% of the internet suffered from issues, blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum kept operating normally. Unlike the usual networks that usually have some point of centralization, blockchain networks run in a completely decentralized manner. This means that even if some nodes go offline, the network isn’t affected. Earlier in the year, Amazon’s AWS also experienced a major outage, causing disruption in large parts of the internet. Even then, blockchain networks remained stalwart. As for what caused the latest Cloudflare outage, Knecht has said it was a latent bug in a service related to the company’s bot mitigation capability. It started to crash, cascading into a broad degradation of Cloudflare services. “This was not an attack,” clarified Knecht. The CTO has also shared that an investigation report is on the way, with transparent details related to what happened during the event included. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $93,300, down 9.5% over the last week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: WhatsApp owns India! - by Dharmesh Ba

Time Published: 2025-11-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
India’s most used business software isn’t chosen - it’s tolerated. Over the past 18 months, I poured lakhs of rupees and time into building automation tools on top of WhatsApp - and failed. That failure opened up something bigger: a look into the tangled web that holds up India’s messaging infrastructure. This is everything good, bad, and quietly dangerous about WhatsApp - and our growing dependence on it. It’s quite a long read. In 2023, I met a cosmetic store owner in Nagpur who had accidentally invented demand forecasting. He sells beauty products - Korean serums, Indian sunscreens, foreign moisturizers. His challenge wasn’t competition or pricing. It was more existential: his shelf space could hold maybe 200 SKUs, but his customers now wanted access to 2,000. Ten years ago, this wasn’t a problem. A woman would walk into his store, and he’d guide her. “Try this Lakmé sunscreen. Let me show you how to apply it.” He hired young women specifically for this - people who could explain products, who could teach. But Instagram changed the game. Women no longer came to his store to discover products. They came with screenshots, asking for specific Korean brands they’d seen on reels. If he didn’t have it, they left. And he couldn’t stock everything. So he invented a system. He joined a vendor WhatsApp group - wholesalers who posted about new products arriving in the market. When something looked promising, he’d post the image to his WhatsApp status. Or he’d share it in a customer group he’d built over years. Then he’d wait. If even two or three people asked for the price, he knew there was demand. He’d place an order before the product even touched his shelf. He wasn’t using WhatsApp for communication and marketing alone but turned it into a just-in-time inventory system. This was India’s answer to the Shopify + Stripe stack. Discovery happened on Instagram. Demand validation happened on WhatsApp Status. Payment happened on UPI. Small businesses had discovered that consumer apps could be hacked into business tools. In this WhatsApp owns India’s communications layer. And unlike every other tech platform, there’s no competitor even close. Instagram competes with Twitter and YouTube. WhatsApp has... nothing. This creates both opportunity and danger. WhatsApp isn’t a product Indians use. It’s infrastructure Indians depend on. Infrastructure is different from products. Products are things you choose. Infrastructure is what you assume exists. You don’t think about electricity until the power goes out. You don’t think about roads until they’re blocked. India stopped thinking about WhatsApp years ago. It’s just... there. Assumed. Essential. This matters because of a simple truth: when something becomes infrastructure, its problems stop being individual frustrations and start being citizen problems. A business owner spending two hours a day manually managing WhatsApp groups isn’t just inefficient - it’s a productivity tax on the entire economy. WhatsApp work messages and personal messages in groups - it’s a design failure that affects work-life balance for millions. The question isn’t whether India needs better WhatsApp tools. The question is whether WhatsApp, as designed by Meta for Meta’s goals, can ever serve as the infrastructure India needs. To answer that, we need to understand what WhatsApp actually is - and what it isn’t. Most people think WhatsApp is a single app. It isn’t. Meta offers three distinct products with different users: WhatsApp: The everyday consumer app WhatsApp Business: A mobile app for small businesses, with profiles, catalogs, chat labels, and auto-replies to manage customer chats. WhatsApp Business API: Not an app but infrastructure - an API (via Meta Cloud or Business Solution Partners [1]) that connects WhatsApp to CRMs or back-end systems for large-scale messaging. Bottom line: one phone number can be linked to only one WhatsApp product at a time. If it’s registered on the WhatsApp Business API, it can’t also be used on the standard app - and vice versa. Though WhatsApp has rolled out a recent workaround. Here’s the critical part: these three “WhatsApps” behave very differently The consumer app and the WhatsApp Business mobile app expose full phone UIs (groups, stories, calls, broadcast lists, catalogs) that people and small shops use directly on an app. But the WhatsApp Business API historically only supported a subset of the app features and couldn’t do many of the interactive, UI-driven fetures that make WhatsApp feel like WhatsApp. For example, you cannot create or manage groups, post WhatsApp Status, or manage channels via APIs yet. Update: Meta has added Groups endpoints and a Calling API to the WhatsApp Business Platform. You can now automate some group actions and initiate voice calls via the API - within tight limits and platform rules. As of Oct 28, 2025 there’s still no official API to post Status Updates like the mobile app. In short: when small businesses say “we run everything on WhatsApp,” they usually mean the consumer or Business mobile apps - with manual groups, broadcasts, and catalogs. True automation and scale require the Business Platform/API, which is powerful but not really designed for typical SME needs. WhatsApp’s business model is simple. Meta charges per message on the WhatsApp Business API, with rates varying by country and message type (Marketing, Utility, Authentication, Service). Businesses can reply free of charge within 24 hours of a user’s message; after that, only approved templates can be sent - and those cost money. In India, rates are about ₹0.78 for marketing and ₹0.11 for utility/authentication messages. Example: 10,000 marketing messages = ₹7,800; 1,000,000 = ₹7.8 lakh monthly. Businesses can use the platform directly via Meta’s Cloud API or through Business Solutions Providers like Gupshup, WATI, Interakt, or Twilio. BSPs add their own fees on top of Meta’s, so prices include markups and platform charges. Most WhatsApp SaaS vendors sell both software and message credits - earning largely from those markups. When Meta changes rates, profits shrink or costs rise for customers, creating instability. The pricing volatility makes WhatsApp a shaky base for predictable business models. Here’s a paradox: The businesses that most need WhatsApp automation are the ones least able to use it. For instance, one of the most common patterns we’ve seen is business owners consistently updating their WhatsApp status each morning with details about the day’s fresh vegetables, sharing posts about new stock in their groups, and responding to customer inquiries within minutes. These actions have become almost daily rituals for entrepreneurs running their businesses on WhatsApp. Such simple automations today are not possible on the main WhatsApp mobile apps but only possible in their API version. Most small businesses in India use one phone number for everything - personal and work. But the WhatsApp Business API needs a separate, dedicated number that can’t run on the regular or Business app. Porting the existing number would mean losing existing chats and giving up the mobile app and certain crucial features like groups management and WhatsApp status posting. Without the WhatsApp Business API even simple automations stay out of reach for SMEs Even with an additional number, setup is a pain. You need to link it to Meta Business Manager, create and submit message templates - all buried in Meta’s dashboards. Many small businesses turn to unofficial modified versions (mods) of WhatsApp or to access automation and additional features. GBWhatsApp is the most famous unofficial app that can help you run two accounts, auto-reply, tag chats, and send follow-ups, see deleted messages - without using the official API. These tools work but violate WhatsApp’s rules, risk malware or data leaks, and can lead to account bans. Here are some top features of the WhatsApp ‘mods’ that are helpful for SMEs Auto Reply: Configure automatic replies per message or contact. Message Scheduler: Schedule messages to send at set times. Broadcast to Multiple Groups: Send one message across several groups at once. Multi Account Support: Use two or more WhatsApp accounts on one device. Bypass Forward Limit: Forward messages to unlimited chats. Always Online Mode: Keep your status showing online continuously. It’s a messy market trading serious security and compliance risks for convenience. The irony is almost poetic: WhatsApp became essential infrastructure because it was simple and open to everyone. Yet, the moment businesses try to do anything advanced with it, it turns into a maze. And there’s another catch: most WhatsApp automation tools live on the web, not as mobile apps. Why? Because if you try to launch a mobile app called “WhatsApp for Business” or “WhatsApp Automation,” Meta will hit you with a trademark notice, and Google Play will take it down. So every SaaS company ends up building a web dashboard instead. But the small business owners live on their mobile devices. If the problem were just technical limits, businesses could adapt- learn the rules, find workarounds, move on. But the real instability comes from something deeper: WhatsApp optimizes for Meta’s goals, not yours - and those goals change without warning. That creates systemic unpredictability that businesses quietly pay for. Delivery drops: In 2022–23, marketing messages reached 90–95% of users. By mid-2025, that fell below 75%. Meta added hidden user-level caps to fight spam - no announcement, no numbers. Businesses only found out after delivery cratered. [2] Sudden suspensions: Accounts get blocked - sometimes permanently - for vague policy violations. The appeal process is slow, and while it runs, operations stop cold. [3] Shifting rules: In Oct 2025, WhatsApp quietly banned all “general-purpose AI chatbots.” The term isn’t defined, leaving even compliant tools exposed. [4] Even if you master the tech, pricing, and compliance, you’re still building on shifting ground - where Meta’s priorities decide your uptime. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: these aren’t problems Meta is trying to solve. They’re features of the system working as intended. Meta is an advertising company; ads pay the bills. Every product in their portfolio - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, even Oculus - exists to collect data and sell ads. WhatsApp is the outlier. It’s a messaging tool that, in a different world, might have evolved like Telegram, Slack or Microsoft Teams: an open platform where developers build productivity tools, businesses customize workflows, and ecosystems flourish. But that’s not Meta’s DNA. If WhatsApp opened up like Slack, businesses would build their own solutions. They’d customize the experience. They’d create value that Meta couldn’t capture. From Meta’s perspective, that’s money left on the table. So instead, WhatsApp is being slowly transformed into an ads platform. You’re starting to see it: Ads in WhatsApp Status (already rolling out) Paid WhatsApp channels (in beta) Business messaging in groups Click to WhatsApp ads From a pure business perspective, this makes sense. Why would Meta invest engineering resources to solve a hundred-million-dollar problem (Indian MSME productivity) when they could deploy those same resources toward a billion-dollar opportunity (WhatsApp ads)? To put it bluntly: Meta doesn’t care about your kirana store’s inventory management problem. Not because they’re evil, but because they’re a trillion-dollar company optimizing for trillion-dollar opportunities. WhatsApp will never be the open platform India needs, because Meta’s business model requires it to stay closed. Which raises an obvious question: If WhatsApp can’t serve as the infrastructure India needs, what can? India’s WhatsApp problem isn’t unique. China faced something similar a decade ago - and solved it deliberately. WeChat handles everything WhatsApp does, plus native payments, mini-apps, ride-hailing, food delivery, and government services. The architectural choices Tencent made are precisely what WhatsApp lacks. In WeChat, businesses can send users only 4 marketing messages directly per month through service account. Beyond that, marketing messages get quarantined into a separate subscription feed/folder - visible but segregated from personal conversations. This forces discipline. Every message must justify its existence. The result: businesses target better, users feel less harassed, and the platform maintains trust. WhatsApp has no such limits. Businesses face tiered messaging caps (starting at 1,000 recipients daily for new accounts) but these scale automatically based on quality scores. The only real constraint is cost - and when marketing messages work, companies pay willingly. The incentive structure rewards volume, not restraint. When an employee leaves a Chinese company, their WeChat relationships vanish with them- customer conversations, sales context, years of institutional knowledge, gone. Tencent solved this with WeCom (WeChat Work), a parallel app for professional communication. In WeCom, workplace conversations belong to the company, not the employee. When someone leaves, their account transfers. Customer relationships survive. Search for a person on WeChat in China, you see two options: their personal WeChat, professional WeCom. Same ecosystem, separate contexts. You message friends on WeChat, coordinate work on WeCom. Both feel familiar, both interoperate, neither bleeds into the other. In 2022, WeCom has about 180 Million active users and are used by over 10 million businesses in China. [5] The boutique store owner shouldn’t manage customer orders where his daughter sends memes. The sales team shouldn’t lose client relationships when someone quits. The contractor shouldn’t coordinate labor in the same group planning his wife’s birthday. The solution exists. WeCom proves separating contexts without fragmenting networks is possible. But WhatsApp won’t implement it - not because of encryption, but because of infrastructure. WhatsApp’s value to Meta isn’t in reading your messages - they’re encrypted. It’s in the metadata around them: who you talk to, when, from where, and which businesses you engage with. Meta has added ads to WhatsApp’s Status tab, but the real value lies in metadata and business messaging, not large-scale ad placements. Linking WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram through Accounts Center lets Meta build a unified behavioral profile - without touching message content. [6] Splitting personal and professional WhatsApp use would shatter that identity layer. Meta wouldn’t lose access to messages - it never had them - but it would lose the metadata correlation powering cross-platform personalization. Keeping all communication in one place creates richer data, tighter business tracking, and a more valuable ecosystem. Which leaves the real question: if Meta won’t separate it, who will? WhatsApp isn’t going anywhere.Half a billion Indians won’t switch apps. Businesses won’t rebuild customer relationships. The network effects are too strong, the switching costs too high. Our goal should be to build optionality in the form of building ONDC-like infra for messaging. A protocol could make the platform used irrelevant. Instead of building one mega-app to rule all of e-commerce, ONDC built the rails underneath. A seller listing on one ONDC app can be discovered by buyers on completely different apps. Orders, payments, fulfillment - all work across platforms. No gatekeepers. Just open infrastructure. The same architecture can break WhatsApp’s monopoly. A messaging protocol doesn’t need 500 million users on day one. It needs 500,000 users who will pay because the protocol solves a problem WhatsApp won’t. For example we could start with construction contractors. They need labor coordination, site photos, payment tracking, and material orders - all over messaging. WhatsApp works, but barely. A purpose-built tool would save them hours daily. That’s the wedge. Once one vertical proves interoperability works, others follow - logistics, healthcare, education, government services. The network grows without forcing anyone to switch. The protocol layer should provide the essential stuff: End-to-end encryption standards Message delivery guarantees Identity verification Cross-app routing APIs Different apps build specialized experiences on top: One for Gen Z, one for the elderly, one for MSMEs and they should all be able to talk to each other. Same network. Different interfaces. Just like you can email someone on Gmail from Outlook. The protocol doesn’t care. It just routes messages. Email, the web, and Bluetooth already work on open protocols. WhatsApp solved India’s communication problem. Now India needs to solve WhatsApp’s incentive problem. That doesn’t mean banning WhatsApp or building a clone. It means creating optionality - a messaging layer where WhatsApp is one choice among many, not the only one that works. This isn’t about nationalism or rejecting foreign technology. It’s about infrastructure resilience. No nation should have its business communication layer entirely controlled by a single foreign corporation with different incentives. The question isn’t whether to replace WhatsApp. The question is: What does India need to build so that WhatsApp’s limitations stop being India’s limitations? That’s the conversation worth having.

You can download the People’s Voice report on AI opportunities for Indian SMEs, created by People+AI in collaboration with 1990 Research Labs, below. Download Report This is hands-down one of the best infrastructure analysis pieces I've read on Indian tech. The cosmetic store owner's WhatsApp-as-inventory-system story perfectly captures how consumer apps get hacked into business tools when proper B2B infrastructure doesn't exist. What really stands out is your framing of the incentive mismatch: Meta optimizes for trillion-dollar ad opportunities while Indian MSMEs need hundred-million-dollar productivity solutions. That gap explains everything - the API restrictions, the pricing volatility, the feature stagnation. The WeChat/WeCom comparison is especially powerful because it shows the solution exists and works at scale. The separation of personal and professional contexts isn't a technical challenge, it's a business model choice. Meta won't build it because unified identity metadata across contexts is more valuable than serving SME needs. Your ONDC-for-messaging proposal is the right architectural direction. Interoperability solves the 'network effects as moat' problem without requiring mass migration. Start with one vertical (construction contractors is a great wedge), prove the protocol works, let ecosystem diversity emerge. One addition I'd suggest: the protocol layer should include reputation/trust primitives from day one. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is great for privacy but terrible for platform-level spam control. A federated messaging protocol needs portable reputation that follows business identities across apps - otherwise every new entrant rebuilds spam filters from scratch and user experience suffers. The question isn't whether this gets built, but who builds it and whether it stays open. Government-backed infrastructure has different risks than VC-backed platforms. Both can succumb to capture. The governance model matters as much as the tehcnical architecture. Would love to see a follow-up on that. Recently we started building some small solutions on Whatsapp through BSP. Also use it as a primary comm channel. It’s abundantly clear the limitations of WhatsApp while even building simple stuff. And the cost of messaging has increased to 0.80 in India. With delivery rates reducing businesses will need to look for another solution like RCS. This almost mimics the path brand Facebook pages took. Organic reach used to be 100% and now it’s barely there No posts Ready for more?

The rupee gained 2 paise to close at 88.58 against the US dollar amid strong equity markets and lower crude prices. CareEdge Ratings expects the passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes to grow by around 4% in FY26, driven by GST rationalization, easing inflation, and supportive fiscal measures in the Union Budget 2025–26. The GST cut on small cars (28% to 18%) is likely to revive entry-level demand, which has been under pressure for the last few years while removal of Cess on SUVs will further boost demand. SUVs are expected to continue dominating the market, growing by 8–10% and outpacing overall industry growth. Meanwhile, EV penetration is likely to remain modest at 3–4% while Hybrid volumes could grow by 34-38% in FY26, reaching ~1.07–1.10 lakh units, up from ~80,406 units (registered) in FY25. Madhusudhan Goswami, Assistant Director, CareEdge Ratings said, “GST rate cut coinciding with robust consumer sentiment in the festive season led to PV registrations reaching an all-time monthly high in October 2025. GST rate cut led to improved affordability, especially for the first-time PV owner. Also, robust growth in retail sales was observed across rural and urban markets. Going forward, with the end of festival season, PV sales is expected to normalize, however, growth momentum is expected to sustain due to upcoming harvest season boosting rural demand along-with seasonal demand from weddings.” The PV industry recorded healthy growth of 7.4% in FY24, which moderated to 3.7% in FY25, in line with CareEdge Ratings’ expectations. This slowdown was primarily due to the levelling off of pent-up demand, higher vehicle prices, and the high base effect of previous years. Despite these challenges, new model launches and strong SUV demand sustained overall momentum. Utility vehicle (UV) volumes grew 21.8% in FY24 and 14.0% in FY25, supported by a robust order book and rising preference for SUVs. In contrast, passenger car volumes declined 8.5% in FY24 and 11.5% in FY25, reflecting subdued entry-level demand and a structural shift toward SUVs. In a move that underscores the rising expectations for security and compliance across Web3, Polygon has officially listed Cyberscope, a subsidiary of TAC InfoSec Limited (NSE: TAC), as the first Smart Contract Audit company in the Polygon Ecosystem. The listing appears under the “Tools” category — placing Cyberscope alongside the foundational infrastructure powering thousands of decentralized applications on one of the world’s most scalable blockchain networks. For TAC InfoSec Limited, this marks another decisive step in its global Web3 expansion strategy — one that industry analysts say could materially influence the company’s audit volumes, revenue mix, and market leadership as blockchain security becomes a top-line concern for developers and investors. People familiar with the matter estimate that the Polygon integration could drive 400–500 new project engagements annually, of which 320–350 are expected to convert into full smart contract audits, supplemented by 60–80 KYC verifications. The demand pipeline is tied to the rapid growth of Polygon’s ecosystem and the increasing pressure on emerging Web3 teams to meet institutional-grade compliance norms. 360 ONE Asset has announced the appointment of Pritam Doshi as Chief Investment Officer and Head - Renewable Energy.

Extreme fear, record ETF outflows, and a brief slip of the futures curve into backwardation underscored the depth of the move. Yet several structural indicators are turning supportive, liquidation clusters are building in the $85K–$90K region, and short-term holder capitulation is nearing exhaustion. Together, they point toward a maturing correction phase rather than the start of a deeper bear cycle. Bitcoin’s asymmetric reaction to equity weakness also mirrors patterns historically seen around macro lows. Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s slide. Ethereum’s 20% monthly decline has driven its Mayer Multiple below 1, a zone that has repeatedly marked long-term accumulation ranges. Liquidity pockets near $2,900–$2,760 may still induce short-term volatility before a base settles. Solana and XRP recovered modestly on the week, but exchange reserves and open interest trends show broad deleveraging across majors rather than exit-driven selling. With sentiment compressed and risk premiums elevated, the market is operating inside a technical pocket that has often preceded reflexive rebounds once macro drivers stabilise. Our advice: The market is showing signs that the worst of the selling may be behind us, but it is still early to call a turn. Liquidations around $85K to $90K and cooling capitulation tell us sellers are tiring, yet we need spot strength to confirm it. Stay light, avoid leverage, and let the market show stability before adding risk. Stick with BTC and ETH for now, and treat altcoins as short, tactical trades until liquidity improves.” Hindustan Copper informed exchanges that an accident at Malanjkhand Copper Project at Balaghat District of Madhya Pradesh (a unit of Hindustan Copper Ltd) led to the demise of one contractual employee engaged by a mining contractor.

The Tenneco IPO received heavy bidding in all categories. It was subscribed 58.83 times in total, with the retail portion getting booked 5.11 times, QIBs subscribing 166.42 times and NIIs subscribing 40.74 times, BSE data showed. Tenneco Clean Air India is the domestic arm of Tenneco Inc, a leading global supplier of clean-air systems, powertrain components, and advanced suspension solutions. With its dominant market position at 57% in clean air for Indian commercial trucks and 52% in passenger vehicle shock absorbers, it is well-positioned in this market driven by BS-VI compliance and regulatory tailwinds. The company’s strong leadership in clean air and advanced automotive components, rising demand for SUVs and premium vehicles, a strategically diversified product portfolio, long-standing partnerships with OEMs, and access to global R&D put it in a good position to capitalize on both domestic growth and export opportunities. Investors who have received allotted shares may book partial profit at listing at premium and can keep rest for long term. On the other hand, those who did not get shares in IPO may wait for dip.

Thanks & Regards, Kunal Sodhani (Beast) (Personal view) Indian government bonds are expected to trade in a tight range early on Wednesday, with sentiment likely to remain subdued as buying from a key investor category, which includes the central bank, slumped in the previous session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note may drift between 6.50% and 6.55%, a trader at a primary dealership said, after ending at 6.5258% on Tuesday. Purchases from the “others” category, which includes the Reserve Bank of India, plummeted to about 2 billion rupees ($22.58 million), compared with a daily average of 50 billion rupees in the week ended November 7 when the central bank returned to secondary market purchases of bonds after a gap of six months, CCIL data showed. The RBI’s buying earlier this month had raised hopes that the demand–supply balance in the market would improve. The recent drop in volumes has now reinforced traders’ conviction that the purchases were largely to replace maturing holdings, rather than to send a signal for lower yields. “No buying from the others category is negative for bonds, but any further news on India’s inclusion in global indices will support the market,” a trader at a private bank said. The 10-year yield eased about 2 basis points on Tuesday, after local media reports suggested India’s chances of inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index had improved, traders said. Focus is also on the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes due after market hours on Wednesday, for cues on the U.S. rate-easing trajectory. India's equity benchmarks are set to open flat amid subdued global sentiment and investor caution ahead of key economic data.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

Full Content:
Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

SpaceX's partner, T-Mobile, is pressing US regulators to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile, arguing that the company’s satellites risk causing harmful interference to terrestrial cell networks. On Tuesday, T-Mobile sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, which is reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite internet service for phones. It urges the FCC to "take no action" on AST's application "unless and until sufficient information is provided” about the radio interference concerns. “AST has failed to demonstrate that its proposed SCS [Supplemental Coverage from Space] operations will satisfy the Commission’s stated goal to minimize the risk of interference from SCS services to existing terrestrial networks,” the carrier says. T-Mobile adds that AST should be required to disclose its maps detailing where the satellite signals will reach in the US, including over traditional cellular sites. “Accordingly, AST must provide maps that show the overlay of its satellite beams on all geographic market areas, for all relevant elevation angles, including license areas to which it will have access to terrestrial spectrum, and how its satellites will be capable of confining SCS service to those licensed areas,” T-Mobile claims. It also alleges that AST has been using metrics to underestimate the potential radio interference to user equipment. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company’s upcoming constellation is poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which launched through T-Mobile in July. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to deliver its own satellite-to-phone service, starting as soon as next year. To do so, the company is preparing to launch dozens of exceptionally large "BlueBird" satellites, with the first prototypes scheduled to fly in the coming weeks. But another crucial step is receiving FCC approval to officially operate the satellite-to-phone service in the US. The radio interference concerns from T-Mobile are a bit ironic, considering its partner SpaceX has faced and fought back against its own interference claims from other companies. Such disputes are nothing new at the FCC, where satellite operators routinely lobby for spectrum access and regulatory approvals. SpaceX previously challenged AST’s plans through earlier FCC filings. However, AST has fired back, calling out SpaceX as anticompetitive and criticizing its approach to satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Players who own one or both of the classic collections for Lara Croft can score some sweet discounts, too. By Evan Campbell on November 18, 2025 at 11:20AM PST Switch and Switch 2 owners can now experience the start of Lara Croft's Survivor trilogy. Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition has not only been announced out of nowhere for Nintendo's systems, but the survival-adventure game is now available on both consoles, too. Developer Aspyr is behind the Switch and Switch 2 ports for Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, according to the official Tomb Raider website. The game features everything from the original 2014 Definitive Edition release, including online multiplayer for up to eight people. Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition has a download size of 27.3GB on Switch 2 and 27.1GB on Switch. Both versions of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition cost $20--there's no surcharge on Switch 2--and there's a special 10% launch discount through November 24. Not only that, but there's also a stackable loyalty discount for people who own the Tomb Raider remasters on Switch. So if you have Tomb Raider VI-VI Remastered, for example, you get an additional 10% off for 20% off total. And then another 10% can be added by owning Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. Developer Crystal Dynamics is currently busy working on the next Tomb Raider game, with Amazon serving as publisher. However, Crystal Dynamics has seen multiple rounds of layoffs this year, and Microsoft canceled the Perfect Dark reboot--another project the team was developing. Meanwhile, a new trailer premiered earlier today on X for Season 2 of Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft animated series. There is no word on whether the rest of the Survivor trilogy will head to Switch and Switch 2. For more, check out GameSpot's Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition review.

November 18, 2025 13:12 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it successfully launched a suborbital mission with its HASTE launch vehicle for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) - advancing national interests in safeguarding the homeland through the testing of advanced technologies for missile defense. The launch on HASTE – Rocket Lab’s commercial launch vehicle for regular and reliable hypersonic test flights – took place from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, at 13:00 UTC/08:00 a.m. ET on November 18, 2025. Led by MDA, the mission deployed a government-provided primary payload developed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and multiple secondary payloads by federal and industry partners, which tested key technologies for missile defense applications. The mission was contracted to Rocket Lab through the DIU’s Hypersonic and High-Cadence Airborne Testing Capabilities (HyCAT) program, an initiative supporting test and evaluation of new and emerging hypersonic technologies through low cost, responsive and long endurance flight testing. The mission launched within 14 months of contract signing, demonstrating streamlined operational benefits for government customers through Rocket Lab’s commercial speed, innovation, and efficiency. The mission also exemplified the cost and schedule savings that commercial liquid launch vehicles can bring to the MDA test community for developmental testing, non-traditional targets testing, and risk-reduction payload testing activities. Rocket Lab’s Vice President Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, says: “HASTE is an important platform for accelerating hypersonic technology readiness for the nation, and we’re proud to be delivering this mission for DIU and MDA.” LtCol Nicholas Estep, Director of DIU’s Emerging Technology Portfolio, says: “Accessing the commercial and non-traditional ecosystem is a key enabler to accelerating progress in the hypersonics community of interest, particularly for closing mission timelines and driving towards mass and affordability. Working with MDA to demonstrate commercially-focused sub-orbital launch services is a great example of that axiom.” The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth launch of its HASTE rocket since the launch vehicle’s debut in 2023. A suborbital variant of Electron - the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket - HASTE includes much of the same innovative technology as Electron, including carbon fiber composite structures and 3D printed rocket engines, but has a modified upper Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic technology tests and a larger payload capacity. HASTE can deploy technologies at speeds of more than 7.5km per second to test air-breathing, glide, and ballistic payloads, as well as technologies to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from space. Combined, the HASTE and Electron launch vehicles have deployed 200+ payloads for government and commercial customers to date. Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Title: Layoff notices flared in October across much of U.S., Fed report shows
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/layoffs-warn-notices-october-employment-economy-federal-reserve-report/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T17:16:30Z

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 12:16 PM EST / CBS News Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs. It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Layoff notices across the 21 states tracked by the Cleveland Fed reached a peak of more than 550,000 in March 2020. Major companies including Target, Amazon and UPS have announced rounds of job cuts in recent weeks, with some economists noting that the labor market appears to be weakening. The record-long government shutdown has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions. Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while ADP data released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1. Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come. Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a Monday email that they expect layoffs to pick up next year amid wider AI adoption, while noting that the technology has had a "net positive impact" on the labor market so far this year. The delayed September employment report, which will be released Thursday, will provide another barometer on the health of the U.S. labor market. Economists polled by financial data provider FactSet predict payroll gains of 50,000. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their slide Tuesday afternoon, amid worries about an AI bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were down about 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. Home Depot (HD) shares fell 4% after the home-improvement retailer reported disappointing third-quarter earnings and cut its full-year profit outlook. Cloudflare (NET) shares declined 3% after the web security company was affected by an outage that hit several prominent customers, including social media site X and ChatGPT. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday, were down 3%. Microsoft (MSFT) shares were also about 3% lower after the two Magnificent 7 members announced partnerships with Claude AI developer Anthropic. Nvidia and Microsoft said they will invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic as part of the deals. Medtronic (MDT) shares rose 4% after the maker of medical devices reported better-than-expected fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook. Shares of crypto-treasury firm Strategy (MSTR), which entered Tuesday down 27% this month as the price of Bitcoin has tumbled, rebounded roughly 6% along with the price of the largest cryptocurrency. Merck (MRK) stock advanced 4% after the pharmaceutical firm announced positive results from a Phase 2 trial of a heart drug. Oil and gold futures slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower. The U.S. dollar was little changed against the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is making moves few would expect from the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett spent decades telling investors he doesn't understand technology stocks well enough to bet big on them. Yet Berkshire Hathaway's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the company has made a new $4.9 billion wager on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), while offloading shares in long-held favorites like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Are these signals that the company is shifting its investment philosophy? The surprise stake in Google’s parent company, worth about $4.9 billion, marks one of the conglomerate’s biggest moves in recent years—one that seems to challenge Buffett’s long-standing caution toward Silicon Valley. With Buffett planning to “go quiet—sort of,” as he put it last week, after his final months as CEO, the moves could mark a new era for one of the world’s most closely watched portfolios. The company’s new 17.8 million-share position in Alphabet signals a potential change in how Berkshire approaches technology stocks. The purchase stands out as Berkshire’s largest new investment of the quarter, after Buffett grew the company's massive cash pile to $382 billion while others poured their money into tech stocks this year. At the 2019 Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger said they had "screwed up" not buying Alphabet earlier, despite watching Google advertising spark massive sales across their own businesses. At the time, shares traded around $59, increasing nearly fivefold in price since. This isn't a typical Buffett buy. The Oracle of Omaha has consistently shied away from tech stocks he says he doesn't fully understand, making an exception only for Apple—which he famously reframed as a consumer products company instead. The timing could suggest Abel's growing influence as he prepares to officially take over as CEO in the New Year. Still, Berkshire's Alphabet shares are worth far less than its stakes in Coca-Cola (KO, 9.9%) and Chevron Corp. (CVX, 7.1%), continuing a portfolio historically dominated by consumer staples and energy. The cut in Apple shares is part of a longer story between the companies. Berkshire slashed its shares by almost 15% last quarter, which means it's sold about 74% of its stake in AAPL in the last two years alone. That seems to mark a systematic unwinding of what was once one of Buffett's highest-conviction bets. The steady sell-off of Bank of America stock suggests Buffett—or his team—sees limited upside in traditional banking at 2025 stock values, possibly concerned about economic headwinds or simply rebalancing away from financial services. Together, those moves continue a broader pattern of profit-taking on legendary legacy holdings. Even so, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest single investment—about 21% of its total portfolio. Meanwhile, Berkshire added $1.2 billion to its Chubb insurance stake, indicating that it remains interested in financial services when the stock price is right.

As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is making moves few would expect from the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett spent decades telling investors he doesn't understand technology stocks well enough to bet big on them.

Title: Will the price be right? What shoppers can expect for the holiday season

Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:00:20Z

By Candice Williams and Myesha Johnson, The Detroit News FERNDALE, Michigan — Concerned about this year’s holiday season, the owners of Modern Natural Baby and Kids planned ahead. In addition to mailing out 10,000 Christmas catalogs for the first time, the store opened a warehouse to house more inventory, including stuffed animals and books. “We bought a lot of this stuff in March and April when we were worried about tariffs and not having stuff available for Christmas,” said Emily Murray, who co-owns the Ferndale store with her husband, John. “We’ve been buying this stuff for a long time this year, and we have a warehouse that we’ve never had before, so primarily that was a result of tariffs.” Retailers are preparing for a holiday season clouded by tariffs, inflation and economic uncertainty. Consumers will see higher prices, fewer deep discounts and tighter inventory in some categories. As a result, they are expected to be more selective with their purchases, trading down on everyday items like groceries to afford higher-priced gifts. Deloitte projects that overall holiday spending will decline about 10% this year as consumers spend less due to economic concerns, while Adobe Analytics expects online holiday sales to rise about 5%, pointing to the strength of e-commerce even among increasingly budget-conscious households. Despite these mixed forecasts, retailers remain optimistic that holiday sales will improve over slower traffic earlier this year. “We’ve had such a long season of decline,” said Vic Veda, vice president of communications for the Michigan Retailers Association. “We’re continually hoping that we’re going to turn that corner. Seeing our retail index as high as it is for the outlook at the end of the year really tells us that retailers are very much looking forward to this holiday shopping season and hoping that the holidays will get folks back a little more compared to what they were this summer.” According to the Michigan Retailers Association, about 63% of retailers surveyed expect sales to increase through the end of the year, one of the highest outlooks in recent months. Of those surveyed, 31% said they anticipate their sales will decline, while 6% expect no change. Veda said robust Halloween spending could point to a stronger-than-expected holiday season; the National Retail Federation projected sales would total a record $13.1 billion. She said that while inventory levels are generally stable, smaller stores face greater uncertainty due to tariffs and limited funds to buy ahead. Overall, prices of goods are expected to keep increasing due to the tariffs and inflation, said Juan Mundel, associate professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University. “Prices are expected to be higher this season, and while retailers are going to introduce discounts … consumers should not expect the same prices as last year,” he said. Then there’s the issue of leaner supply. Stanley Lim, assistant professor of supply chain management at Michigan State, advises shoppers to buy early if they see something they want. This year’s retail challenges stem mostly from economic pressures, particularly rising logistics costs and tariffs. “The supply chain isn’t broken … but it’s definitely running a lot leaner and more compact than before,” he said. “And so retailers will not feel the tinge of not having the stock or missing the containers, but (instead) maybe longer replenishment cycles and tighter margins. So they may be more selective in terms of what items they want to make available on the shelf this holiday season.” Lim said many retailers are launching promotions at the beginning of November to get ahead of Black Friday, and even offering price guarantees to assure customers that early purchases will match any later markdowns. Some retailers have already announced Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. For example, Walmart offered a sneak peek last week of its first Black Friday Deals event that begins Nov. 14 online and in-store. The retailer is promoting what it calls its biggest lineup of deals, including “thousands of deals under $20,” John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. Earlier this month, Meijer announced an early promotion of double mPerks savings on toys through Nov. 4, as well as the return of its Santa Bucks during select weeks in November and December. The retailer said it has hundreds of toys and gifts priced under $10, $20 and $30. Mundel said Black Friday sales are ideal for consumers shopping for items like TVs and sportswear, while Cyber Monday will offer the best overall deals of the season. “After Cyber Monday, prices will continue to increase, leading to the holiday season,” he said. Consumers will likely trade down on everyday goods like groceries and cosmetics to free up money for higher-priced gifts such as electronics and video games. According to Deloitte, consumers are expected to spend an average of $1,595 this holiday season, down 10% from $1,778 in 2024. A majority of shoppers, 70%, plan to shop during the Thanksgiving week, up slightly from 68% in 2024. Traffic is expected to peak between late November and early December, including shopping events on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday. One recent weekend at Modern Natural Baby and Kids, shoppers including Marisa Vinsky, 31, and Jon Young, 34, took advantage of the store’s free gift wrapping service. The Lansing, Michigan, couple bought a pop-up book that says “Hello” in seven languages as well as a sensory, weighted stuffed octopus for a 10-month-old baby girl. Vinsky said she’d be shopping again online and at big-box stores like Costco and Home Depot around Black Friday in search of the best deals for an electric meat smoker for Young. “The way the economy is right now … I typically shop online,” she said. “I don’t really go to stores, and that’s how I find things. One year, I got him a KitchenAid, and that was really easy to find online. I can imagine that with the economy and how much everything is being raised with tariffs, I can imagine the prices are going to be higher than average.” At Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan, last week, holiday decorations were already on display amid preparations for Santa’s visit this week. General Manager Scott Lofton said he expects the mall to be busy during the holiday shopping season, especially on Black Friday. Sisters Constance Laderoot and Chibwe Powell, both in their 40s, brought their mother to the mall to walk around. They weren’t holiday shopping just yet — instead, they picked up some clothing for themselves. Laderoot said she thinks Black Friday shopping habits have changed, with fewer people lining up before dawn for deals. She said she’d like to see retailers offer more in-person deals and increase the number of items available at discount prices. “I think most of us have scaled back a little, right?” she said. “So most people are doing online shopping, and then there’s some in-person shopping.” Powell said she plans to start holiday shopping right after Thanksgiving, adding that because she also has some birthday gifts to buy: “I start shopping early.” She’s looking forward to Macy’s perfume deals during the holidays. “Macy’s perfume situation, when it happens, it’s impressive,” she said. Black Friday is still relevant, Powell said. “It’s just been a tradition. You don’t want to always go away from the tradition. I remember being nine months pregnant and shopping.” Elle Dare, owner of Genuine Toys in Plymouth, Michigan, said preparing for this year’s holiday season has been especially challenging because tariffs have disrupted toy production and driven up prices. “The toys that are produced for Christmas are made in the summer, and they stopped production because of tariffs,” she said. “So it’s spotty getting things in. Some things we know aren’t going to come in until January. One company, we get a box every other day of just one item. It’s hard.” Dare said she hopes to have the store fully stocked by mid-November, ahead of Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. Vendors can’t guarantee delivery dates since overseas shipments take about eight weeks and face customs and tariff delays once they reach U.S. ports. “I would tell people, if you see it now, get it,” she said. “If it does sell out, there’s no way we’re ever going to get another shipment before the holidays.” Prices have increased due to tariffs. For example, an item that used to sell for $50 is now going to be $65. “At $50, it was a good deal, but will our customers be willing to pay $65 for it?” she said. “This is such an odd situation.” MSU’s Lim said price increases due to tariffs are based on factors such as the product category and country of origin. “Some (retailers) may be willing to absorb the cost, the additional cost to gain demand and loyalty, but others may not have sufficient margins to absorb, and so they will have to then pass down to the customers,” he said. Some shoppers have already finished their holiday buying, Dare said, anticipating further price increases, while others are waiting to see what happens. She said some families may focus on one main gift for their children and supplement with a few less-expensive gifts. “Even if the tariffs ended today, the tariffs have still been paid on the toys that are in the warehouses, so that cost still has to be passed on,” she said. “They wouldn’t immediately come down.” Among the most popular products are Calico Critters and Smiskis, small collectible figurines sold at a handful of stores in Michigan. Genuine Toys limits purchases to two per customer due to high demand, Dare said. Modern Natural Baby and Kids has already seen an influx of customers for the holiday season, said John Murray. The store carries brands including Jellycat and Sam & Julia. “It’s insane already,” he said. “People have already started shopping. That’s the crazy part about it. Everybody’s kind of afraid that there’s not going to be inventory. … Everybody’s worried not that there’s not going to be toys, but will the best toys be available.” The store employs 10 people, adding three staff members for the holiday season. “It’s going to help us out for the holiday season having the extra help,” said Emily Murray. Larger retailers are also hiring seasonal workers to handle an increase in shoppers. For example, Target is offering additional hours to current employees and hiring seasonal team members across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 supply chain facilities. Amazon said it is creating 250,000 seasonal positions nationwide, including 6,500 jobs in Michigan. At Genuine Toys, Dare said she’s adding two workers to a staff of five. Catching Fireflies plans to add three to five part-time workers at each of its locations in Berkley, Rochester and Ann Arborm, Michigan, to meet expected holiday demand. The store sells whimsical gifts, including novelty socks, kitchen gadgets and specialty cookbooks. “Twenty percent of our sales happen in the month of December alone,” said owner April McCrumb. “Hanukkah and Christmas definitely play a huge part in our retail success. Once the holidays kick in, that’s when a lot of profit from being in the gift business comes.” ©2025 www.detroitnews.com. Visit at detroitnews.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: A Decade In The Making, HaptX Team Debuts Full Body VR Haptics

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. In 2017 I visited a small VR startup called AxonVR in Seattle. Founder Jake Rubin showed me concept art for a full body suspension system. A user hung in mid air inside a frame, held in place by a network of supports that allowed the arms and legs to move freely. The idea was simple to state and difficult to build. They wanted to create total immersion by capturing every motion and returning physical feedback across the user’s entire body. It looked like something from a futurist exhibit. It also captured the ambition of a team that believed VR needed more than visuals and audio to be useful. The suspension system never shipped. AxonVR changed its name to HaptX and shifted its focus to haptic gloves powered by microfluidics. The team found immediate demand for precise tactile feedback in robotics, training, and design. Gloves became the company’s core product. Enterprise customers used them to train medical staff, evaluate automotive prototypes, and operate remote manipulators. Defense agencies incorporated them into medic training modules. Robotics groups relied on them for fine motor teleoperation. That focus eventually reshaped the company. HaptX began working closely with a manufacturing group called Advanced Input Systems. The partnership deepened over the years and expanded again in 2024. The gloves became a supported product line inside the broader organization. The combined entity adopted the name 1HMX. Rubin and members of his team became part of the larger company. The resources available to them changed. The manufacturing footprint now spans several continents. The gloves matured into a stable commercial product with a large global customer base. Last week Rubin reached out again. The note contained a link to a new system called Nexus NX1. It launches next week under the 1HMX brand. Rubin told me it is the closest thing the company has ever built to the suspended full body concept they sketched ten years ago. The visual form is different. The purpose is the same. The Nexus NX1 joins three mature products in one turnkey system. The HaptX Gloves G1 provide detailed tactile and force feedback. The Virtuix Omni One provides a platform that enables a user to walk in any direction while remaining stationary in physical space. Freeaim robotic shoes add natural stride and foot movement. The system tracks seventy two degrees of freedom across the hands and body. It captures posture, limb rotation, foot placement, center of mass, and soft tissue movement. It returns real time tactile information from hundreds of points on the fingers and palms. The result is a body scale interface that can control both virtual characters and physical robots. Users can walk, reach, grasp, and lift with realistic feedback. Developers can collect data describing how skilled workers move through complex tasks. Robotics teams can link the system to a humanoid robot and observe how a trained operator performs precise motions. Training groups can use it to rehearse procedures inside simulated environments. The introduction video shows the intended use. A person walks inside the Omni platform. The shoes move with the surface. Every gesture and shift in balance flows through the system. A humanoid robot mirrors the movements. The user receives touch and pressure information through the gloves. It is not a suspended rig. It is grounded. The experience is shaped by the strengths of the components. I asked Rubin how closely Nexus NX1 matches the vision he described in 2017. He said it aligns with the goal the team set when they were still called AxonVR. Full body input, full body output, and real physical response. The form changed. The intention remained. Preorders for Nexus NX1 open November 18 with shipments expected in second quarter 2026. It marks a return to the idea that started the company. AxonVR imagined a full body system before the industry had a way to build it. The version arriving now comes from a far larger organization with the scale to produce it.

The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged inverse (–2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund pursues daily leveraged inverse investment objectives, which means it is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage. The Fund magnifies the inverse performance of the Underlying Security and is designed strictly for short-term use. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund’s performance will be the result of compounded daily returns, which is very likely to differ from –200% of the return of RKLB over the same period. It is possible investors could lose their entire principal within a single trading day. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the Fund may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single issuer or sector may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee the Fund’s strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of their investment. RKLB Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s inverse investment strategy, the Fund enters into swap contracts and options contracts based on the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (“RKLB”) common stock (the “Underlying Security”). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of the Underlying Security, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect -2X exposure to changes in the share price of the Underlying Security, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Underlying Security’s share price increases. If the share price of the Underlying Security increases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: Indirect Investment in RKLB Risk. Rocket Lab Corporation is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates, and is not involved with this offering in any way. RKLB has no obligation to consider the Fund or its shareholders in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Fund shares. RKLB Good Performance Risk. The market value of Rocket Lab Corporation may increase if the company achieves or exceeds its business goals, expands its partnerships with government or commercial clients, or benefits from favorable policy, funding, or market sentiment toward the aerospace and satellite sectors. Innovations in propulsion and launch vehicle technology, successful missions, or heightened investor enthusiasm could further contribute to stock price appreciation, adversely impacting the Fund’s inverse exposure. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific factors may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than diversified investments. The Fund focuses on a single equity security and may fluctuate sharply compared to the broader market. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will result from each day’s returns compounded over time, likely differing from -200% of the Underlying Security’s performance before fees and expenses. Compounding effects are magnified during volatile markets and extended holding periods. Daily Correlation/Tracking Risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of inverse correlation to RKLB’s share performance. Market disruptions or high volatility may cause the Fund’s exposure to exceed or fall short of its target -200% objective. Leverage Risk. The Fund will seek -2X inverse exposure through financial instruments such as swaps and options, which can amplify both gains and losses. Leverage increases volatility, and losses may exceed the Underlying Security’s gains on any given day. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk that counterparties to its derivative positions may default, experience insolvency, or fail to perform obligations. The Fund may be unable to recover its investment or experience delays in recovery. Derivatives and Options Risk. The Fund’s investments in swaps and options involve heightened risks including market volatility, imperfect correlation with underlying securities, and liquidity or valuation challenges. Option contracts, in particular, are influenced by actual and anticipated volatility and can rapidly change in value. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, their value will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Rising rates typically cause declines in fixed income prices, particularly for longer-duration instruments. Other factors such as credit, extension, and prepayment risks may also negatively affect the Fund’s NAV. Rebalancing Risk. If the Fund cannot rebalance its portfolio or rebalances incorrectly, its exposure may deviate materially from its -2X investment objective, increasing risk and reducing performance accuracy. Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of assets in a single issuer or small number of issuers, resulting in greater potential loss. Liquidity Risk. Derivative positions or certain underlying securities may become illiquid during periods of market stress, impeding the Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. New Fund Risk. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history, which may increase uncertainty in achieving its investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage commissions may apply.

Pulse Films was behind Gangs of London for Sky and AMC Gangs of London maker Pulse Films is to stop production of TV and film content after parent company Vice Studios Group made a number of layoffs in the UK. The celebrated scripted prodco, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has made shows such as Netflix factual hit The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann and Sky action series Atomic, will now make only branded content, music videos and commercials. According to reports by Deadline, Vice has made layoffs in Pulse’s London headquarters, with all future scripted projects – such as a fourth season of Sky/AMC gangster series Gangs of London – to now be taken over by Vice Studios in LA. Vice Studios Group co-president Jamie Hall last week was named the new scripted MD for BBC Studios Productions, with the former Pulse Films chief operating officer and president of scripted TV set to take up his new role in January 2026. Vice Studios is led by former Amazon and Paramount executive Amy Powell, who was named president in May. In August, Vice raised US$75m via a new credit facility led by Western Alliance Bank, with plans to use the funds to support content investment through Vice Studios. The company said the credit facility was part of a larger five-year, US$500m investment in developing and producing scripted and unscripted content for TV, streaming and digital. Pulse was impacted in 2022 by the departures of founders and CEOs Thomas Benski and Marisa Clifford, who stepped down after 16 years at the prodco. Their departure came six years after the pair, who founded Pulse Films in 2005, sold a controlling interest to Vice Media Group. Benski subsequently joined forces with French actor Omar Sy (Lupin) and Hollywood director Louis Leterrier to launch scripted outfit Carrousel Studios in 2024, as well as rolling out talent- and IP-led media group and venture capital firm Lumina late last year. In September, Lumina made a seven-figure investment in creator-first UK management group Arcade, which represents YouTube collective The Sidemen.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It was difficult in the beginning to answer the question I got from everyone: what’s it like living in America again? After all, I had been coming back to Wisconsin in the summer for years, and my move back happened in the summer; things mostly felt like more of the same. Then, the leaves started turning colors, the air became chillier, and, as daylight grew shorter I came to relish one decision in particular: living in the suburbs. There is much to be said for urban life, and I was certainly spoiled in that regard living in Taipei. It always seemed odd to answer the question “What is the best part about living in Taiwan?” with the word “Convenient”, but that’s the honest truth: everything you needed was within walking distance, the subway was extensive, clean, and reliable, and, once you understood that traffic was governed by the rule of rivers (the bigger you are the more right of way you have), driving really wasn’t that bad either. When my parents first moved away from Wisconsin I needed a new place to stay for the summers and, concerned about upkeep of an empty house in the harsh winter, I opted for a downtown condo; it helped that downtown Madison was a beehive of activity with the university and state government, and I liked the idea of walking everywhere. Then came COVID and the summer of 2020, and suddenly downtown wasn’t so busy anymore; I found myself driving more than I expected, and feeling rather sick of condos, which I had lived in my entire adult life. And so, when a house opened up near an old friend, I snapped it up, remodeled it to my liking and then, this past year, decided to live there full time. It’s fashionable to hate on the suburbs, particularly for millenials just a bit younger than I am; I was born at the tail-end of Generation X, and my experience in small town Wisconsin was one of leaving the house in the morning on my bike and not coming home until dinner, hopefully in one piece. It was, all things considered, pretty idyllic, but I can imagine that the clampdown on youth freedom that happened over the last few decades, along with the rise of indoor activities like video games and smartphones, made the suburbs feel increasingly alienating and isolating. What a relief to move to the big city, particularly in the 2010’s when Uber came along. There were, in the 2010s, few companies more contentious than Uber, and not just because of the scandals and willingness to operate in the gray area of the law. There was a massive debate over whether or not the company was even a viable business. Hubert Horan, in his seemingly never-ending series insisting that Uber would never be profitable, twice attacked me personally (and dishonestly) for believing that Uber would scale into profitability: One does not have to immediately accept all of those conclusions to see that Thompson’s various claims suggesting that Uber might someday have a viable welfare enhancing business are not backed by any hard evidence about efficiency advantages or sustainable profitability. All of Uber’s growth has required massive investor subsidies — $2 billion in 2015 and $3 billion in 2016. All of these subsidies have been destroying competitors who are more efficient but can’t withstand years of subsidies from Silicon Valley billionaires. Thompson argues that Uber has grown total market demand and offered greater service options at night. True, but all due to unsustainable predatory subsidies. Thompson says that Uber’s app gives it the great competitive advantage of controlling its customers. False — people don’t like Uber because the app has a neat user interface, people like Uber because the app shows more cabs at lower prices than competitors can offer. All of those cabs and low prices are due to unsustainable, predatory subsidies. Thompson insists “the fact remains that both Uber riders and drivers continue to vote with their feet” justifies his belief that Uber’s approach to regulation is right, but again ignores that they are not voting for the more efficient producer, but for massive service subsidies. Thompson is falsely claiming that Uber’s growth reflects the free choice of consumers in a competitive market. Uber’s predatory subsidies are designed to undermine the processes by which competitive markets help allocate resources, and then to eliminate competition altogether. If these benefits were created by legitimate efficiencies, as Thompson imagines, there would be evidence showing how they made Uber more cost competitive, or how they similarly transformed competition in other markets. To refute the points here about Uber’s predatory, market-distorting subsidies, Thompson would need evidence that Uber has scale economies powerful enough to quickly convert $3 billion operating losses into sustainable profits, and evidence that Uber has competitive advantages overwhelming enough to explain driving everyone else out of the industry. Since Thompson does not have any of this evidence, he can’t claim Uber has produced benefits for anyone but itself. Well, here we are in 2025, and over the last 12 months Uber has made $4.5 billion in operating profit, and that number is trending upwards (and doesn’t include the significant profits Uber makes from its non-controlling interests in other mobility companies that it gained thanks to its aggressive expansion); no, I didn’t have evidence of that profit in 2017, but I did understand how scale works to transform money-losing software-based Aggregators into profitable behemoths in the long-run. Another classic of the Uber bear genre was this 2014 post by NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran attempting to determine Uber’s true value; the startup had just raised $1.2 billion at a $17 billion valuation, and according to Damodaran’s calculations, “it is difficult to justify a price greater than $10 billion” (his actual valuation was $5.9 billion). Investor Bill Gurley — before his dramatic powerplay that led to the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick — explained what Damodaran got wrong in How to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber’s Potential Market Size: The funny thing about “hard numbers” is that they can give a false sense of security. Young math students are warned about the critical difference between precision and accuracy. Financial models, especially valuation models, are interesting in that they can be particularly precise. A discounted cash flow model can lead to a result with two numbers right of the decimal for price-per-share. But what is the true accuracy of most of these financial models? While it may seem like a tough question to answer, I would argue that most practitioners of valuation analysis would state “not very high.” It is simply not an accurate science (the way physics is), and seemingly innocuous assumptions can have a major impact on the output. As a result, most models are used as a rough guide to see if you are “in the ball park,” or to see if a particular stock is either wildly under-valued or over-valued… Damodaran uses two primary assumptions that drive the core of his analysis. The first is TAM, and the second is Uber’s market share within that market. For the market size, he states, “For my base case valuation, I’m going to assume that the primary market Uber is targeting is the global taxi and car-service market.” He then goes on to calculate a global estimate for the historical taxi and limousine market. The number he uses for this TAM estimate is $100 billion. He then guesses at a market share limit for Uber – basically a maximum in terms of market share the company could potentially achieve. For this he settles on 10%. The rest of his model is rather straightforward and typical. In my view, there is a critical error in both of these two core assumptions. Gurley argued — correctly in retrospect, given that Uber’s gross bookings over the last 12 months were $93 billion in rides and $86 billion in deliveries — that Damodaran failed to consider how a radically better experience could dramatically expand the addressable market, and completely missed the potential for network effects leading to an outsized share of that expanded market. I do feel Uber’s effects even out here in the suburbs: when I lived in Madison decades ago, there only seemed to be about five taxis in the whole city, and they were only ever at the airport; now a ride is six minutes away, and I’m sure it would be even shorter if I were more centrally located. That’s particularly appreciated in a place like Wisconsin, not only because of the cold, but also the culture of drinking; the reduction in drunk driving alone has long placed Uber solidly on the “societal good” side of the ledger, at least in my book. Of course I rarely take Ubers: if you’re in the suburbs you drive, and fortunately, I like driving. That’s not the case for everyone, however: while my wife has driven in Taiwan for years, she’s always been nervous about doing the same in America, with its higher speeds, longer distances, and more uncertain directions. That’s why I got her a Tesla: instead of her driving the car, her car drives her. I’ve actually dawdled in writing this Article because I wanted to try out v14 of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) first, but it’s been over a month since its release and I still don’t have the Update, so my experience is based on v13. That’s ok, though, because Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is actually pretty amazing. It really does go from origin to destination without intervention pretty much all-of-the-time (v14 reportedly addresses the actually leaving the driveway and parking part of things), although I take over more than my wife does. My issue with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is two-fold: the first is that it is the absolute best worst driver in the world. What I mean is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) always handles the situation in front of it with aplomb, including tricky merges, construction, etc. I’m particularly impressed at how it stays with traffic, including speeding when appropriate. That’s the best part. The worst part is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) seems to have zero planning: it will change lanes even though a turn or an exit is half a mile away, which is particularly galling when an exit lane is backed up; if you don’t take over that leads to an embarrassing attempt to merge back in a quarter mile down the road. In other words, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) gets in more messes than it should because of a lack of foresight, but it handles those messes perfectly. As someone who thinks well ahead of my route in an endless pursuit of efficiency this drives me crazy, but honestly, I would take best worst driver over the vast majority of drivers I encounter on the road. My second issue is related to why I keep writing out the whole name: the “Supervised” part drives me absolutely batty. Yes, yes, I shouldn’t look at my phone, but is it better to be forced to exit a perfectly competent — more than competent — driving mode to manually steer while sending a text? More galling is when I am looking ahead at a turn — which necessitates turning my head — and get yelled at by my own car to pay attention. I am paying attention, by actually trying to plan more than two steps ahead! Regardless, I absolutely do believe that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is good enough to be Unsupervised, at least in good weather; it’s a bummer to realize that that still may not happen for a long time, and even when it does, the price may be things like actually flowing with traffic, even if it’s a few miles over the speed limit. Even then, however, what exists today — and make no mistake, Full Self-Driving (Supervised), with its ability to follow a route, is a step-change from lane-following adaptive cruise control — is enough to make a meaningful difference to someone like my wife. It’s a lot easier to enjoy the big house and yard when you have the capability to go somewhere else. One challenge I didn’t anticipate was that while trash pickup comes once a week, recycling pick-up is only every other week; that’s a problem given the number of cardboard boxes we go through, mostly from Amazon. In all seriousness, Amazon has transformed suburban living. It was always the case that the idea of dashing off to the nearby store was more theory than reality, even when I lived downtown; at a minimum I usually still drove. Next day delivery, however, completely changes the mental calculus: the likelihood I will run out of time to go to the store tips the balance towards just ordering what you need the moment you need it; the next day — and sometimes sooner — it’s on your porch (Walmart deserves a callout here: their delivery is usually even faster if you order something in store). Of course it’s nice to not have to worry about your delivery disappearing, or have to cart it up the stairs or in the elevator; you also have the suburban advantage of having places to store supplies, so you don’t run out in the first place. That was always true though — it’s why big box retailers were very much a product of the suburbs — but marrying that advantage to maximum convenience is a big win. Food delivery definitely isn’t as good, particularly for the Asian food I sometimes crave; our family has always been one to cook our own food, however, which is of course easier with a big kitchen (and three different types of grills). The better restaurant options are also all downtown, so that’s a minus, but hey, you can always Uber. The broader takeaway is that while there are still certain conveniences that come from a central location, the convenience delta — thanks first and foremost to Amazon — has been dramatically reduced. There is a point to this diary, and it comes back to Uber. Not only was I a bull during Uber’s rise, I’ve also been fairly optimistic about the company’s fortunes when it comes to robotaxis. From an Update late last year: Robotaxis are a technology, not a market — a means, not an end, if you will. Markets are defined by demand, and the demand to be tapped is transportation. And, in this market, the dominant player is Uber; no they don’t have their own robotaxis, but from a consumer perspective, they might as well: the rider doesn’t own the vehicle they ride in, they summon it from an app, and they just walk away when the ride is done. The experience — if not the novelty — is the same with a human driver or a robotaxi. Moreover, the human drivers come with some big advantages from Uber’s perspective: they bear their own depreciation costs, and can make individual decisions about the marginal rate necessary to provide supply, which is another way of saying that Uber can more easily scale up and down to meet demand by using price as a signal. It is an open question as to whether robotaxis can ever economically scale to meet demand: having enough capacity for peak demand means a lot of robotaxis sitting idle a lot of the time, while maximizing utilization means insufficient supply during peak periods. This last point is why my assumption is that Uber will very much be relevant in the robotaxi era: their supply network will be essential for scaling up-and-down within cities, and serving all of the areas that the centralized fleets do not. What is less clear is their long-term profitability, which may be somewhat out of their control. That last sentence was about Uber’s diminished bargaining vis-à-vis a centralized robotaxi operator versus individual drivers, and it’s an important one in terms of Uber’s long-term valuation. However, as robotaxis continue to expand — Waymo is now in five cities (three via their own service, two via Uber), Tesla (with human supervisors in the car) in two, and Amazon’s Zoox in one — I do wonder if I am making a similar mistake to Horan and Damodaran. First, like Horan, am I too caught up in the current economics of robotaxis? As an apostle of zero marginal costs I am intrinsically allergic to the depreciation inherent in the cars themselves, along with the significant marginal costs in terms of energy and insurance; Uber side-stepped this by offloading those costs to the drivers. Can scale solve this? At some point — Cybercab already points to this future — vehicles will be purpose-built at scale to be robotaxis, and my experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) has me convinced that insurance costs will be manageable, not just because of scale, but because there will be fewer accidents. Second, like Damodaran, am I limiting my thinking by focusing on the current market — even if that market is already massively larger than the taxi & limo market ever was? The experience of a Waymo is certainly magical; it’s also peaceful, and by removing the human from the equation, provides a sense of safety and security that Uber has always struggled with. This last point could address a major suburban point point, which is kids: the lockdown in kids’ freedom corresponded with a dramatic rise in organized activities, the sheer volume of which leaves lots of parents feeling like unpaid Uber drivers themselves. Some may rely on Uber to solve this problem; it seems likely to me far more would be willing to entrust their children to a Waymo. That does still leave the peak demand question: even if kids become a major market, what do all of these rapidly depreciating cars do during the day? And thus we arrive at why Amazon acquire Zoox: the obvious answer is delivery. The only thing better than next day delivery is same day delivery; the only thing better than same day delivery is same hour delivery. The best way to make that happen in a cost-effective way is to have a huge number of robotaxis on the road that actually aren’t making the decision that prices aren’t high enough, at least as long as those prices cover the marginal cost of a trip, which, in the case of a robotaxi, includes energy but not a human. Of course you still have to get the package to the doorstep, which is where robots come in; Tesla is explicitly going in this directions. From The Information: Optimus is Tesla’s biggest long-term bet. Musk has said there will eventually be more humanoid robots than cars in the world, and that Optimus will one day be responsible for about 80% of Tesla’s market capitalization. Inside Tesla, he’s pushed the Optimus team to find ways to use the robot in tandem with another big, nearer-term bet: the Cybercab, according to a person with direct knowledge. That includes Musk’s desire to have the Optimus robot sit in the Cybercab so it can deliver packages. That should be possible: newer versions of the Optimus robot are capable of consistently lifting and moving around with roughly 25-pound objects for three to four hours on a 30 minute charge, another person with direct knowledge said. But the connection between the robot’s torso and legs isn’t flexible enough to allow it to seamlessly get in and out of a Cybercab, according to the first person. Tesla would need to redesign the robot to change that or use a different vehicle for deliveries more tailored for Optimus’ shape, that person said. This is obviously all still a ways out, but it all feels a lot more possible today than it did even a year ago; relatedly, it feels a lot more uncertain that Uber will have a long-term role to play — and the company may agree! I thought this announcement from Nvidia at GTC Washington D.C. was a bearish indicator for the company: Nvidia today announced it is partnering with Uber to scale the world’s largest level 4-ready mobility network, using the company’s next-generation robotaxi and autonomous delivery fleets, the new Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 autonomous vehicle (AV) development platform and Nvidia Drive AV software purpose-built for L4 autonomy. By enabling faster growth across the level 4 ecosystem, Nvidia can support Uber in scaling its global autonomous fleet to 100,000 vehicles over time, starting in 2027. These vehicles will be developed in collaboration with Nvidia and other Uber ecosystem partners, using Nvidia Drive. Nvidia and Uber are also working together to develop a data factory accelerated by the Nvidia Cosmos world foundation model development platform to curate and process data needed for autonomous vehicle development. Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 is a reference production computer and sensor set architecture that makes any vehicle L4-ready. It enables automakers to build cars, trucks and vans equipped with validated hardware and sensors that can host any compatible autonomous-driving software, providing a unified foundation for safe, scalable and AI-defined mobility. Uber is bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network — a unified ride-hailing service including both human and robot drivers. This network, powered by Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion-ready vehicles and the surrounding AI ecosystem, enables Uber to seamlessly bridge today’s human-driven mobility with the autonomous fleets of tomorrow. The thing about Uber the first time around is that it wasn’t simply providing a fancy app for the taxi & limo market; it was providing an entirely new experience for both drivers and riders that was orthogonal to that market, which let it create a far larger one. This deal with Nvidia envisions a different sort of evolution, where Uber’s existing market slowly becomes autonomous; that’s possible, even if it means significantly higher capital costs for Uber (and cars that cost more, since they are retrofitted instead of purpose-built). What is also possible, however, is that Uber gets Uber-ed: a completely new experience for both drivers (as in they don’t exist) and riders (including kids and packages delivered at the marginal cost of energy) ends up being orthogonal to the Uber market, and far larger. Moreover, this market will, for specific qualitative reasons around safety and security, be inaccessible to Uber’s core business, meaning the entire vision of “bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network” ends up being a liability instead of an asset. There are larger sociological and political questions around things like urban versus suburban living, just as there were when suburbs were built out in the first place. I do believe that the suburbs are very much back, and not just because I’m back in the suburbs; what will be a fascinating question for historians is the chicken-and-egg one between technology driving this shift, versus benefiting from it. What is worth considering, however, is if the last wave of urbanism, which started in the 1990s and peaked in the 2010s, might be the last, at least in the United States (Asia and its massive metropolises are another story). The potential physical transformation in transportation and delivery I am talking about is simply completing the story that started with entertainment and television in the first wave of suburbia, and then information and interactivity via the Internet, particularly since COVID. There are real benefits to being in person, just like there are to living in the city, but the relative delta to working remote or living in the suburbs has decreased dramatically; meanwhile, offices and urban living can never match the advantages inherent to working from a big home with a big yard. Whether or not this is good thing is a separate discussion; I will say it has been good for me, and it’s poised to get even better.

Now, he is bringing his management skills to an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up with fewer than 100 employees. Project Prometheus, which Mr Bezos co-founded with scientist Vik Bajaj, will use AI to accelerate engineering and manufacturing in fields like aerospace and cars, The New York Times reported. The start-up has US$6.2 billion (S$8 billion) in funding, sourced in part from Mr Bezos himself, and employees counted in the dozens, some of whom were poached from leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. As co-CEO with Mr Bajaj, Mr Bezos is back in a formal executive post for the first time since stepping down from Amazon in 2021. The billionaire has since devoted time to his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and made headlines for his personal life, including a star-studded wedding in Venice in 2025. Mr Bezos has also more closely aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s administration, attending his inauguration in January and ordering a pro-business revamp of the opinion page at the Washington Post, the news media outlet he owns. Project Prometheus enters a crowded AI market dominated by tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, alongside pioneering firms OpenAI and Anthropic. The venture is part of a broader trend towards applying AI to physical tasks, often using robotics. Unlike the generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, it aims to develop systems that learn from real-world experimentation, rather than just digital text, with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery in physics, chemistry and engineering. Another dramatic shift since Mr Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 is the rise of AI-native start-ups built around ultra-lean teams – a reversal of the old playbook that equated headcount expansion with business growth. When Mr Bezos left the CEO seat at Amazon, he oversaw more than 1.6 million employees. On the company’s most recent earnings call, current CEO Andy Jassy attributed thousands of recent layoffs to ongoing efforts to eliminate layers of bureaucracy after years of over-hiring. Some parts of Mr Bezos’ philosophies may require a reboot for the AI era. His preference for lengthy memos with narratives indicating deep thinking by the author may be outdated now that workers can use generative AI tools to do the writing for them. But his Darwinian approach to work culture jibes with what is expected now at many of the hottest AI start-ups. And some of his management ideals, like keeping teams lean and fast and making them exceptionally talent-dense, will arguably never go out of style. When Mr Bezos stepped down after 27 years of running Amazon, he was widely lauded as one of the best CEOs in tech history. If his new start-up succeeds, it will likely come down in part to how relevant his management philosophy still is – or how much it has evolved.

Title: Dutta Dismantles the Fed's Rate-Hold Case
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/11/17/dutta-ends-the-fed/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T19:26:30Z
Full Content:
Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

Title: Major MMO Is Coming To Steam With A $50 Alpha Test, Which Is Actually A Discount

Ashes of Creation could be the next big MMO, if it ever releases in full. By Cameron Koch on November 17, 2025 at 9:32AM PST Indie MMORPG Ashes of Creation, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to Steam. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50. That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation website. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam. Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play. Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ. "Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states. Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from. "Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players." Ashes of Creation ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to pay $500 for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--one set in the Warhammer universe and another called project Ghost led by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street. Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of active development on its MMO New World, which once had more than 900,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO. It was, strangely, not the first time that has happened. A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO.

Title: The Glassing of the Drones and the Future of those Regions

“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.” -Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises. One of the crazy aspects of the collapse of Pandemic Horde as an alliance has been how suddenly everything fell to pieces for them. As with the Hemingway quote, they seemed to be failing slowly for quite a while… pulling back as we moved forward, giving up whole regions without a fight… and then everything fell apart. I have a post in mind to trace that path, to put a timeline and some structure around it. But that is something for another day. This past week saw the Imperium wrapped up in taking apart the Drone regions, one structure at a time. That started with the Keepstar in R-AG7W, which feels like it blew up ages ago, but it was just last week. The Keepstar finally boiling over into a wreck Then there was a brief respite or maybe a day or two when people moved back to Insmother after the big event when we were deploying back again to the Keepstar we dropped in the system, or to the Keepstar that Solyaris Chtonium sold us, to start setting timers on structures. I got out there on my main and my alt, each in a Kikimora, each loaded up with Occult, the high damage, short range ammo preferred for structure bashing, and then started going on structure shoot fleets. My Kikimora on its way For a few days it was almost bizarre out in the Drone regions it was so quiet. We had fleets moving all over, but there were almost no hostiles to be seen. We had temp blued Solyaris Chtonium as part of the Keepstar deal so they could move north to setup shop with Fraternity as WinterCo without us shooting them. Likewise, Northern Coalition, NCDot, also betrayed by Pandemic Horde, was focused on move ops out of the Drones and into the north. There were regular camps at a couple of the regional gates getting into the Drone regions, but within the regions itself it was often safe to simply move around on your own. That changed as the weekend arrived and other groups saw some opportunities to camp gates within the Drones and drop on unwary Imperium pilots lulled into a false sense of security after a few days of quiet. That led to a titan out shooting structures getting dropped on and destroyed. Pings went out to remind people not to randomly drive caps around in space where hostiles were hunting. I was in a fleet of Kikis shooting a Tatara that got hot dropped by Hard Knocks Citizens just as we were almost done. They blew up a couple of our ships as we warped off, then proceeded to finish off the structure for us, so we all got on that kill mail. Our job done, we moved on to the next target assigned. They didn’t follow, but they had a fax in tow, so they weren’t going to chase a bunch of destroyers around. Kikis moving on to the next target Target assignments were often a study in chaos management. There were a couplel hundred timers reports to be on the tracking board that our operational coordination group was using, and as new timers came up we often had to split our fleets or get a timer deep enough in so that we could run off to the next timer and let somebody else follow up and hopefully pick up where we left off before the structure self repair finished. This meme was posted during one of our fleets on Saturday morning my time. We were certainly in demand I have been in more system in the Drone regions in the last few days than I have probably been in the last decade. And we kept on rolling, gating to the next location and shooting to set the next structure timer. Kikis orbiting the FC in a Monitor Even in the chaos, a lot of structures went down. The Imperium killed five Keepstars on Friday the 14th.. The Keepstar Count for November 14 That is the most Keepstars killed in a single day that I can recall, something that seems confirmed by looking down the list of Keepstar losses over on zKillboard. I wrote about us blowing up three in a single day back in 2023. Now the benchmark is five, so it wasn’t as big of a deal when we blew up four more on the 15th I suppose. We did manage five more within a 24 hour period starting Sunday and ending today. I did not get on any of those kills. In fact, I spent so much time on Saturday setting timers that I was starting to think that “No killmails for Kikis” might be on the coord guidelines. But there was so much to be done that there was no way to keep up with all the timers and get everybody on the big kills. And I did end up getting on a few. All I need is a few explosions to be happy. Another fiery structure death Overall, a crazy amount of stuff has been destroyed. More than once we found ourselves shooting the wrong structure because there were so many possible timers. I burned through at least 15K rounds of Occult, the close range, high damage small Trig ammo. I saw somebody out in our fleets with a laser fit Gnosis and was jealous. Lasers are the way to go. We need a laser doctrine for bashing. Laser Gnosis shooting a fort As for the destruction, I haven’t seen a total count yet. There was a battle report put together for late Thursday to early Friday last week that showed 2.9 trillion ISK destroyed… and less than a billion of it was ours. Battle Report Header If you go to that link and scroll down the list, you will see a lot of dead structures. And that sort of thing carried on all through the weekend. Somebody will calculate a total at some point I am sure. Meanwhile, Pandemic Horde has been slimming down to become that smaller, elite PvP organization that was promised in past announcements from their leadership. Top Ten Alliances – October 15 vs. November 15 Fraternity, Insidious, and The Initiative seem to be the biggest recipients of PH refugees. I suspect that the outflow isn’t higher because the corps that could negotiate a move because they had a reputation or record to recommend them did. That left behind smaller and more casual corps, plus all the characters in the PH run corps like Pandemic Horde Inc, A Blessed Bean, and Horde Vanguard have to move on their own, and other alliances are busy with corporation moves and probably ignoring single players. Then there are the AFK players who are going to come back to a surprise. And then there is the future of the Drone regions. Asher posted an update to Reddit last night that said the following: Here is the path going forward: Sov: We intend to hold the ihub in G-QTSD and nowhere else. Please start attempting to take sov on Wednesday, we kindly ask if you are taking sov ignore the Imperium glassing fleets, they will do the same to you. The slower it goes for us the longer we’ll be in your future space. Structures: We have glassed many trillions of isk in structures, at one point our timerboard had 635 timers on it. The majority are dead but many still remain which we will be destroying over the next week. If you want to move in – any structure that begins anchoring Saturday the 22nd eve time 00:01 will be considered safe from glassing. We will not destroy any structure that begins anchoring after this time. We may still finish up previous timers after this date expires but we plan to undeploy from the dronelands by the end of this coming weekend. Freeports: Freeport keepstars are in LXQ2-T, 9WVY-F, and F9-FUV. These will contains markets but not jump clones. They will be freeports open to all alliances except Pandemic Horde. You may use them for logistics security, to stage out of, whatever you desire. We are intentionally not putting cloning in to make them less desirable than setting up your own citadel. We will not be holding sov in these freeport systems, you are free to take the sov, moons, etc but not cyno jam the system. We will defend the keepstars from refs – we will reset sov/destroy cyno jammers as needed, so that general logistics security is assured in the dronelands. Overall our hope is that you can find a space where you can grow and flourish. We have burnt down the old monoculture renting forest and we hope a thriving ecosystem will grow. We will not be enforcing byzantine agreements or trying to force people into a fake nullsec with rules meant to keep you from playing the game. Good luck in the dronelands! So we will continue burning things down until we’re done. Some groups have already started moving into the region. We actually hit Keepstar in a system that Brotherhood of Spacers, who used to live in Venal until WinterCo pushed them out in the B2 war, and they pulled out a titan and gave us a ride to our next destination. We were clearing out their future home after all. A B0SS titan waiting to give us a ride We did get a little frisky when Asher warped us over to one of their structures and some people started shooting it… I mean, it is what we had been doing for days, right? No harm no foul though, it was just the shield that took a few hits. Overall it has been a busy few days… week… however long it has been since we jumped into the region feet first. My participation count is up considerably from past months. What have I been up to? That number isn’t a brag… I’d get laughed out of any contest with just that number given how many ops some people are running. I went on fleets with Reageaan at opposite ends of the clock where I slept in between and I am pretty sure he did not. And we get credit for every account that goes along, so I dual-boxed some fleets. But that means that guy with 6 Catalysts in every op I went on was getting 3x to 6x the credit. The number is just an indicator of how much time I’ve spent playing relative to the past couple of months. (That number went up to 50 as I went on ops while writing this, but didn’t want to take a new screen shot. Also, coord gives us bonus credit occasionally for long or annoying ops, so that Woosi fleet where we were sent all over space got us triple credit.) Soon enough we’ll be done, the Drone regions will be clear and we’ll head home and see what develops in this new open section of null sec. Related: I’m very interested to see what becomes of the drone lands. Years ago I’ve written about my time in the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate and their take on a FFA nullsec (jeez…almost twenty years ago!). That didn’t go so well. Then again, we didn’t have a 60k pilot alliance to ensure its freedom, so… LikeLike I’m also hopeful but a little skeptical of its future. I know Asher has done his utmost to make the rules as simple as possible. But I’m afraid the chain reaction of batphones that may occur if/when there’s a big fight will drag him into the type of rules lawyering they’re trying to avoid. Mission creep will set in, unless every single group can avoid any appearance of being a proxy or connected to a bloc in any way. Will that happen? Maybe, who knows. But if a casino was offering even odds on the matter, I’d bet against it. LikeLike As always, we are fighting human nature, and the odds in that fight are never good.

Title: Capture the Rally With These Dividend Plus Growth ETFs

Dividend stocks are not traditionally known for their share price rallies. Companies making distributions to stockholders tend to be stable and well-established, with their biggest growth days long in the past. Similarly, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold baskets of dividend stocks tend to provide investors with a healthy passive income stream simply for owning shares rather than capital appreciation. Occasionally, though, investors can find the best of both worlds. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VEA), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA: EFA), and SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: SPYV) are three ETFs that pay noteworthy dividends and deliver notable capital appreciation. While not the highest of any ETF making distributions, the dividends are still enough to provide a compelling perk for shareholders—especially considering these ETFs are trading at or near year-to-date (YTD) highs after experiencing sizable rallies. VEA capitalizes on the strong performance of many international equity markets in 2025, some of which have outpaced the S&P 500's already robust 15% returns YTD. The fund can be a long-term investment option for investors seeking access to non-U.S. equities. Like many other broad-based Vanguard ETFs, it boasts a highly competitive expense ratio—just 0.03% per year. Comprised of nearly 4,000 total stocks, VEA offers a highly diversified group of stocks at a low cost. The fund's geographic and stock mandates are expansive, as it holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum from Canada, Europe, and parts of the Pacific, with European stocks comprising 52% of its holdings. Japan is the single largest country by portfolio allocation, accounting for approximately 21% of the portfolio. VEA pays out a dividend yield of 2.74%, which is quite high for a fund that doesn't specifically employ a dividend strategy. On top of that, the fund has rallied by close to 29% YTD, or about twice the return rate of the broader U.S. market during that period. Utilizing a similar approach to VEA, EFA distinguishes itself with its large-cap focus. Both funds are sizable and trade very actively, although EFA's trading volume tends to be higher than VEA's, making it a prime choice for traders looking to move in and out of positions more frequently. EFA's basket of stocks is not as extensive as VEA's, but with nearly 1,000 holdings, it still offers exceptional diversification. While the portfolio focuses on European names, Japanese stocks represent the largest portion of the portfolio, at approximately 22%. The fund also invests in a smaller percentage of Australian equities, which may appeal to investors seeking a specific geographic tilt. Where EFA falls short a bit is in its annual fee, which is substantially higher at 0.32%. Still, with an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and YTD returns of nearly 29%, there are plenty of benefits to considering this fund nonetheless. The SPYV adopts a different approach from the two above. Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of cigarettes and other tobacco-related products. This stock offers value investors a compelling entry point, along with a generous dividend yield of 7.09%. Altria manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. The company’s dividend payout is based on free cash flow, ranging from about 64% to 80% per quarter. In recent quarters, free cash flow has exceeded dividend payments, providing a solid buffer. Altria generates strong cash flow from its core tobacco business, which provides a stable base, albeit with regulatory risk, and yields are among the highest in the S&P 500, at least for now. The company primarily sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand, as well as: It sells its tobacco products primarily to wholesalers, including distributors and large retail organizations, such as chain stores. Altria used to own over 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A. (NYSE: BUD), the world’s largest brewer. Last year, the company sold 35 million of its 197 million shares through a global secondary offering. That represents 18% of its holdings but still leaves 8% of the outstanding shares in its back pocket. Altria also announced a $2.4 billion stock repurchase plan partially funded by the sale. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a $72 target price. Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) owns one of the largest portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States. It is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that pays a solid 8.15% monthly dividend and stands out in the market with its unique offering. The company has 224 hotels with more than 30,066 guest rooms across 87 markets in 37 states, plus one property leased to third parties. Its hotel portfolio includes 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels. They are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, including: Apple Hospitality hotels are in various states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, and others. Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating with a target price of $14. This top master limited partnership is one of North America’s largest and most diversified midstream energy companies. Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE: ET) is a safe option for investors seeking energy exposure and income, as the company pays a substantial 7.91% distribution. It owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. It has a strategic footprint in all the major domestic oil and gas production basins. Energy Transfer operates one of the largest integrated midstream systems in the U.S., with nearly 107,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 235 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of storage capacity. Its strong presence in Texas, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides it with access to some of the country’s most affordable natural gas. The company is receiving significant inquiries for pipeline projects to serve power plants (45 plants across 11 states) and data centers (over 40 prospective projects), with potential demand exceeding 5 Bcf/d for power plants and 3 Bcf/d for data centers. The company is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations that include: Following the acquisition of Enable Partners in December 2021, Energy Transfer owns and operates over 114,000 miles of pipelines and related assets in 41 states, spanning all major U.S. producing regions and markets. This further solidifies its leadership position in the midstream sector. Through its ownership of Energy Transfer Operating, formerly known as Energy Transfer Partners, the company also owns Lake Charles LNG Company; the general partner interests, incentive distribution rights, and 28.5 million standard units of Sunoco L.P. (NYSE: SUN); and the public partner interests and 39.7 million standard units of USA Compression Partners L.P. (NYSE: USAC). Barclays has given the stock a Buy rating with a target price of $25. Chevron acquired a 37.5% stake in Hess Midstream L.P. (NYSE: HESM) when it completed the purchase of Hess back in the summer. With a stellar 8.77% dividend on a sprawling midstream asset base, this is an incredible stock to consider now. Hess Midstream owns, operates, develops, and acquires a diverse set of midstream assets to provide services to the company and its third-party customers. The company owns oil, gas, and water handling assets located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin area in North Dakota.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla. However, it does highlight that Tesla’s volatile stock is risky amid a potential market pullback. Yup, super Tesla fan Cathy Woods is directing her firm to sell Tesla too. Tesla shares are at least 10x any reasonable valuation. Only gullible retail investors and index funds are propping it up. When it crashes, it will be fast. It currently trades at a 275 price-to-earnings ratio, which is expected to keep rising this quarter, even if the stock continues to drop from its recent high, as earnings are expected to decline further in Q4. Now, this is not financial advice, but I think it’s worth noting that even though Tesla’s stock hasn’t been linked to its fundamentals in a while, its most significant stock price growth occurred during its period of earnings growth. These days, it’s hard to imagine Tesla going back to earnings growth any time soon. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: Give a Nazi an Inch… And Other Important Lessons From Weimar, Germany
URL: https://lithub.com/give-a-nazi-an-inch-and-other-important-lessons-from-weimar-germany/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T09:59:24Z
Full Content:
On January 23, 1930, there was a heated debate in the parliament of the regional state of Thuringia about the formation of a new right-­wing government including one of Hitler’s most ardent followers and a co-­putschist of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, as minister of the interior and public education. The debate began with the former state premier and SPD parliamentary group leader, August Frölich, criticizing the fact that the president of the parliament had taken down the democratic black, red, and gold flag from the building. Was this intended to demonstrate, he asked, “that the colors of the Third Reich under Hitler and Frick should take the place of the national colors?” In Frick, the speaker continued, “a high traitor”—­who had already broken his oath to the constitution as a Bavarian civil servant and who had never made a secret of his opposition to the parliamentary-­democratic system—­“has been appointed a minister in charge of the [regional] constitution.” The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. Frölich recalled that Frick had pleaded in the Reichstag for amnesty to be given to Ernst Werner Techow, who had been involved in Rathenau’s murder, and had demanded impunity for the Erzberger assassins, Schulz and Tillessen. He reminded the DVP, which wanted to join the right-­wing government, that not long ago, in December 1929, Frick had vilified the late Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann as a paid foreign agent for accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. Repeatedly interrupted by the National Socialists, Frölich concluded his speech with the words: “The election of Mr. Frick makes today a day of political and cultural shame for Thuringia.” That afternoon DVP parliamentary group leader Georg Witzmann tried to justify his party’s stance. Despite considerable reservations, he said, his party had decided to join the government in the spirit of cooperating with all parties “who have the goodwill to serve our country with their work.” Frick had promised to swear an oath to the constitution and also declared that he would drop his accusations of corruption against Stresemann. A firewall on the political right was out of the question for the Thuringian DVP. On the contrary, Witzmann said, the National Socialists were “ideologically and politically closer” to the DVP than the Social Democrats were. In the end, the government was confirmed by 28 votes to 22 from the SPD, KPD, and DDP. Frick became the first National Socialist minister of a regional German government. The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—­served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. After the interlude of the Thuringian united-­front leftist government of the SPD and KPD in the fall of 1923, which ended with the Reich intervening there and in Saxony, the Right had begun to gain strength. The “Thuringian Order League”—­a conglomeration of the DNVP, DVP, and Thuringian Rural League—­emerged as the strongest force in the state elections on February 10, 1924. However, with thirty-­five of seventy-­two state parliamentary seats, it fell short of a majority and therefore had to rely on being tolerant of the Popular-­Ethnic Social Bloc, a successor organization to the then-­banned Nazi Party, which surprised everyone by winning 9.3 percent of the vote and seven parliamentary seats. In the city of Weimar itself, it had even received almost twice as many votes, with 18.6 percent. One of the new government’s first measures was to cut funding for Walter Gropius’s unpopular Bauhaus in Weimar. In response, the director and the “masters,” as the instructors were known, declared their contracts with the state of Thuringia null and void. The world-­famous architecture and art school found a new home in Dessau, the capital of the regional state of Anhalt. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. It was the minister of the interior in this conservative–­extreme right government who in February 1925, after the reestablishment of the Nazi Party, lifted a nationwide ban on Hitler speaking publicly. Gradually, Thuringia replaced Bavaria as the primary stomping ground for the Far Right. “Nowhere in Germany did Hitler, the Nazis, the racist antisemites, the military associations, and extreme nationalists find a better place for their activities,” historian Karsten Rudolph has concluded. In March 1925, Hitler gave his first speeches in Weimar at several packed events. Further appearances followed in October 1925. When in the city, the party leader preferred to stay at the Hotel Elephant, the traditional hotel on the market square, which rolled out the red carpet early on. The hospitality he received was one reason that, after the ban on him speaking was rescinded, Hitler decided to convene the NSDAP’s first Reich Party Conference in early July 1926 in Weimar. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. On the afternoon of July 4, Hitler was allowed to speak at the Deutsches Nationaltheater—­the same venue where Friedrich Ebert had opened the National Assembly on February 6, 1919, and where the National Constituent Assembly had met. “Where Ebert once sat, today Adolf Hitler sits and stands,” boasted the gauleiter, or Nazi regional leader, Arthur Dinter, at a “general roll call” of the SA (Sturmabteilung) and SS. “This is the beginning of a new era.” In September 1927, Hitler dismissed Dinter, who was also the author of the antisemitic bestseller Die Sünde wider das Blut (The sin against blood), from his post because his sectarian idea of restoring the “pure doctrine of salvation” was upsetting people in the party leader’s circles. As his replacement, Hitler appointed the former managing director Fritz Sauckel, an unconditional true believer who would enjoy a long career. It was also in the Weimar Nazi Party administration that an inconspicuous functionary began a career as a cashier and accountant, which would see him become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. His name was Martin Bormann. Likewise, the young Baldur von Schirach, a son of the last grand-­ducal theater director, also found his way to Hitler in Weimar. He wrote verses of homage to the Führer, who would later, in October 1931, appoint him Reich Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. Along with the racist literary historian and avowed antisemite Adolf Bartels and his pupil Hans Severus Ziegler, deputy gauleiter since 1925, it was Schirach who gave Hitler access to conservative, upper-­middle-­class circles in the city. “I love Weimar,” Hitler proclaimed in 1928. “I need Weimar like I need Bayreuth. And the day will come when I’ll give this city and its theater a lot more support. I still have big plans for Weimar and Bayreuth.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. The Nazis took 11.3 percent of the vote in the Thuringian state elections on December 8, 1929. This was more than three times as much as in the regional elections in February 1927 (3.5 percent). In Weimar, they got no less than 23.8 percent. Their success wasn’t accidental. Under Sauckel’s leadership, the party had built up a powerful machine and had aggressively campaigned and stirred up unrest in small rural Thuringian communities. Its success came primarily at the expense of the mainstream parties—­a sign of how voter behavior was shifting and a harbinger of the coming landslide in the Reichstag elections of September 14, 1930. The Berliner Tageblatt was thus very wrong when it dismissed the result as “a fad surrounded by carnival hype that has to be tolerated.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. As in 1924, the mainstream parties of the center and right lacked a majority. Their twenty-­three seats (Rural Association: nine; Business Party: six; DVP: five; DNVP: two; DDP: one) were outweighed by the twenty-­four seats for the SPD (eighteen) and the KPD (six). Since they had ruled out a coalition with the Social Democrats, they needed the support of the six National Socialist MPs to form a government. This time around, Hitler did not want merely to tolerate a coalition. On the contrary, from the very outset, he wanted to be part of the government. Hitler was unusually frank about his motives in a letter, dated February 2, 1930, to a supporter of the Nazi movement living overseas, in which he noted a “great turnaround” in the public perception of Nazism. It was “astonishing how the knee-­jerk, arrogant, snobbish, or stupid rejection of the party of just a few years ago has given way to expectations and hope.” However, he added, such hope would be disappointed if they were to remain in the opposition out of principle. But in return for the party’s participating in coalition negotiations, Hitler demanded two key posts, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of National Education. “The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the entire administration, the personnel department, that is, the appointment and dismissal of all civil servants and the police. The Ministry of Public Education is responsible for the entire school system, from elementary schools to the University of Jena, as well as the theater system. Whoever is in possession of these two ministries and uses his power ruthlessly and persistently can achieve extraordinary things.” Hitler was thus interested not only in participating in government but in taking over the executive from within. “We will pass the first test of our mettle,” predicted Berlin gauleiter and later Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels on January 8, 1930. Hitler added that “only a National Socialist through and through with both great expertise and unconditional National Socialist convictions” could be considered as a candidate to take over the dual ministry. Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler believed he had found the right person in Frick, an early party supporter, the former head of the political division in the Munich police headquarters, and the acting chairman of the Nazi parliamentary group in the Reichstag, calling him “an energetic, bold, and responsible civil servant of extraordinary ability and a fanatical National Socialist!” Initially, the DVP rejected the ministerial appointment of someone who had taken part in the 1923 putsch and been convicted of high treason. “So I went to Weimar myself,” Hitler reported in the letter on February 2, “and succinctly assured the gentlemen in no uncertain terms that either Dr. Frick would become our minister, or fresh elections would be held.” Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler gave his prospective mainstream parties a deadline of three days, from January 10 to 13. Otherwise, he would have a motion introduced to dissolve the regional parliament. But the DVP still had its scruples. Hitler was in a strong bargaining position, however, and he furthered his cause with a speech to leading representatives of Thuringia’s business and industry associations on January 10, which made a huge impression. “In the evening, Hitler spoke to a closed circle,” a very satisfied Goebbels noted. “In front of 150 bigwigs, reeking of respectability. Hitler spoke fabulously. I’ve rarely heard him that good.” Business circles were also ramping up pressure on the DVP, and when the ultimatum expired, the party caved in. On January 23, 1930, the coalition government was confirmed in office. “Frick is now a minister in Weimar,” Goebbels recorded in his diary. “It was a difficult birth.” Frick’s party comrade Wilhelm Marschler was appointed state councillor, a position that gave him a vote in the cabinet. There was no lack of warning voices in the DVP. “It hurts my soul to see you in such company,” shouted DVP Reichstag deputy Siegfried von Kardorff to the delegates from Thuringia at the party’s conference in Mannheim in March 1930. But the fact that the DVP was doing deals with the Nazis at all showed how far the party had drifted to the right under Stresemann’s successor, Ernst Scholz. Making common cause with the National Socialists at regional level while being part of a grand coalition with the Social Democrats at Reich level was a complete contradiction. In that respect, the Thuringian experiment already foreshadowed the imminent demise of Hermann Müller’s government. Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Minister Frick did not disappoint expectations. At the third reading of the laws to enact the Young Plan in the Reichstag on March 12, 1930, he took a seat on the benches of the state representatives and made a statement of vigorous protest immediately before the final vote, railing against the “Enslavement Act,” the adoption of which would bring “the greatest national misfortune and end the independence of Germany’s regional states.” The Thuringian Ministry of State had not authorized him to make this statement. Although the DVP parliamentary group leader, Witzmann, disapproved of his unilateral action a few days later, Frick faced no consequences. Hitler had set his party colleague two tasks. As Thuringian minister of the interior, Frick was to “carry out a slow purge of the administrative and civil service from all red revolutionary elements.” There was “a great deal to do,” Hitler said, especially in policing. And as minister of national education, he was to push ahead with the “nationalization of the school system.” Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Frick set to work with great energy to remake Thuringia in this sense. In his inaugural speech to the civil servants in his two ministries, he made it clear that a “new spirit” now applied in Weimar, and that it would be fundamentally different from the “treacherous November spirit” of the German republic. On March 18, 1930, he introduced to the state parliament the draft of an enabling act intended to largely free the state government from parliamentary control for six months. The law was passed by a simple majority (28 votes to 25) on March 29. Under the guise of reforming and streamlining the administration, civil servants loyal to the republic were dismissed and replaced by followers of the NSDAP. The Reich government, however, did not stand idly by as Frick went about doing what he did. On March 18, 1930, the Social Democratic Minister of the Interior Carl Severing informed the Thuringian government that he had received news “giving rise to justified doubts as to whether the conditions for the granting of a Reich subsidy for police purposes” were still fulfilled. Thuringian State Premier Erwin Baum from the Rural League “solemnly appealed” to the Reich not to block the funds. The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Although the new minister of the interior, Joseph Wirth of the Center Party, who had been in office since March 30, 1930, reached an agreement with the Thuringian state government in April to lift the ban on the Reich subsidy, no agreement was reached on the fundamental question of whether National Socialists should be allowed to join the police force. Frick created a fait accompli by filling the offices of the police directorates of Weimar and Gera with his allies. When Wirth then had police funds blocked again in June 1930, Baum filed a complaint with the State Court in Leipzig. The conflict between Thuringia and the Reich was settled in December 1930, when the former guaranteed the “nonpolitical conduct of individual civil servants without fail while on duty” and the latter agreed to lift the freeze on police subsidies. Frick was unperturbed by all the objections from Berlin and continued his policy of “cleansing” the civil service. Goebbels, who visited him in Weimar at the beginning of June 1930, was impressed: “He is in good spirits, has the courage of his convictions, provokes people, and behaves insolently toward the bigwigs in Berlin. A true German minister indeed.” Civil servants who were members of or close to the SPD were hit particularly hard by the staff cuts the state of Thuringia also had to make due to the precarious financial situation. Frick appointed three of his party comrades to the Ministry of Education, including the deputy gauleiter Hans Severus Ziegler, as “expert advisers.” They acted as a kind of shadow government, with access to personnel files, which they used to tar-­brush undesirables among the teaching ranks. Suspicion and denunciation became pervasive in the Thuringian administration. Parallel to his administrative and personnel purges, Frick set about to radically change the country’s cultural policy. On April 16, 1930, school prayers were reintroduced by a decree in the official gazette of the Ministry of National Education. The reason given was that “forces alien to the species and people” had long been trying to “destroy the spiritual, moral, and religious foundations of our German thinking and feeling in order to uproot the German people and thus make it easier to control us,” the decree stated. The German people could resist these pernicious influences only “if they kept the religious and moral driving forces of their nature pure and passed them on to the next generations of youth.” Three of the suggested prayers were clearly directed against the democratic constitutional order of the Weimar Republic, which was viewed as anathema to the spirit of ethnic jingoism. The second of these rhyming prayers went: Father, in your almighty hand Stand our people and fatherland You were our ancestors’ honor and strength You are our constant weapon and defense Therefore free us from betrayal and deceit Make us strong for the liberating deed Give us the Savior’s heroic bravery Let honor and freedom be our highest commodity! Let our vow and watchword be: Germany, awaken! Lord, make us free! May God make it so! The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Frick left no doubt as to who was meant by the “forces alien to the species and people” in the state parliament in May 1930. The “prayers for freedom,” he explained, were intended to serve as a “defense against the fraud” that had been “committed against the German people by Marxism and the Jews.” The Nazis’ coalition partners offered little opposition to the mandatory bastardized school prayers, and protests from the Thuringian Teachers’ Association and the Protestant regional church were also limited. Conversely, the coalition parties shot down a motion by the SPD parliamentary group to rescind the decree. Frick did, however, lose a lawsuit filed with the Leipzig State Court. In its ruling of July 11, 1930, three particularly offensive prayers were rejected because they impinged on the “sensibilities of dissenters” and thus violated Article 148, paragraph 2, of the Reich Constitution. Before that, in February 1930, Frick had issued an injunction against Erich Maria Remarque’s famous anti-­war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, which had been published in spring 1929 and quickly become a bestseller. School boards in Thuringia were instructed to report which schools had purchased the title and which teachers had used the book in class. Further inclusion of the book in reading lists was prohibited. These regulations were in line with the views of the German Fighting League for German Culture, which had been founded in August 1927 under the leadership of the Nazi Party’s chief ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg. At its Whitsunday conference in Weimar in 1930, held under Frick’s patronage, the league demanded that the “German will to self-­defense must be hardened.” Nazi cultural watchdogs considered Remarque’s bestseller capable of impairing that “will.” The same strictures also applied to the film version of the novel. The Nazi Party, led by Goebbels as the gauleiter of the German capital, railed against the film, which premiered in Berlin in December 1930, and on December 11, the Supreme Film Board gave in to SA intimidation and banned it. “The Nazi street fighter is dictating the government’s actions,” crowed Hitler’s propaganda expert. Frick’s next serious intervention in cultural life came at the beginning of April 1930 with the decree “Against Negro Culture and for German Ethnic Identity.” In its preamble, it claimed that for years, “foreign racial influences,” capable of “undermining the moral fortitude of the German people,” had been “increasingly asserting themselves in almost all cultural areas.” It was therefore “in the interest of the preservation and strengthening of the German ethnic identity” that everything “glorifying Negroism” should be seen as “signs of decay” to be “prevented as much as possible.” The authorities were to apply the “strictest standards” and punish all theater companies that could not be regarded as “morally or artistically reliable.” This decree provided the basis for numerous bans. For example, the performance of Friedrich Wolf’s abortion drama, Cyanide, which Erwin Piscator’s Berliner Ensemble wanted to stage in Gera and Jena, was prohibited. Plays by the expressionists Ernst Toller and Walter Hasenclever also disappeared from the repertoire of state theaters. On May 22, 1930, SPD member of parliament Max Greil, a former minister of popular education, excoriated Frick in front of the Thuringian state parliament, castigating him for trying to politicize all areas of cultural life “along the lines of National Socialist Party beliefs.” Frick’s “proclamation against Negro culture,” Greil argued, was actually directed against Jews, and he demanded that Frick publicly acknowledge this fact. Contrasting Nazi cultural policy with the “classical spirit of cosmopolitanism in the sense of Goethe,” Greil said, “It is the spirit of nationalist narrow-­mindedness; it is the spirit of chauvinist warmongering.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. In his infamous decree, Frick had announced that he had appointed the architect Paul Schultze-­Naumburg as the new director of the Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten (College of Architecture, Fine Arts, and Crafts) in Weimar and that it was to be developed into a “center of German culture.” Schultze-­Naumburg, whom Frick had also hired as an “art consultant,” had made a name for himself as a vehement opponent of the Bauhaus and advocate of a “racially sound” German culture. His house in Saaleck near Bad Kösen, located below the castle ruins, was a popular meeting place for extreme right-­wing nationalist circles. In June 1930, Goebbels was a guest there. He was accompanied by Frick and Walther Darré, later the Nazi food minister. “The Schultze house is beautifully situated above the Saale River, wonderfully blended into the landscape, a true gem,” noted Goebbels in his diary. “I have never seen such a stylish house.” While in the town, the Berlin gauleiter did not neglect to visit the graves of Fischer and Kern, the men who had murdered Walther Rathenau. In his speech inaugurating the newly designed Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten on November 10, 1930, Schultze-­Naumburg raged against modern art, which, he claimed, consisted “only of obscure, tortured, and distorted images and the visualization of mental and physical inferiority.” He was united with Germany’s youth, he added, in the goal of “chasing all those corrupters of and traitors to the people out of the German house, in which they have no place.” Deeds followed these words. That October, Schultze-­Naumburg had wall frescoes by Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer painted over in the Van de Velde building. In early November, at Frick’s behest, seventy works by modern artists, including paintings and drawings by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, were removed from the exhibition rooms of the Weimar Palace Museum. Frick justified this preview of the Nazis’ infamous 1937 campaign against “degenerate art” by claiming that the ostracized works had “nothing in common with Nordic-­German nature” and only “depicted eastern and other inferior subhumanity.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. But the liberal Berlin press, including the Berliner Tageblatt, branded it for what it was: “a scandal in a cultured nation.” But even this scandal was surpassed by Frick’s most audacious coup: the appointment of the racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther as a professor at the University of Jena. In doing so, Frick was acting on Hitler’s expectations in a letter of February 2, 1930, in which the Nazi leader had envisaged the “establishment of a chair for racial issues and racial studies” in Jena as the “first step” in the desired “intellectual upheaval.” Hitler himself had suggested Günther, the author of a “racial primer of the German people,” for the position. When the university rector, church historian Karl Heussi, opposed Frick’s request, the students’ association, already dominated by National Socialist sympathizers, rebelled. Frick praised the Jena student body for having shown “more understanding for the need to create the conditions necessary for Germany’s renewal” than the professors. The only concession made to the university’s teaching staff was that the original title—­Chair of Human Civilization—­was changed to Chair of Social Anthropology. Hitler personally attended Günther’s inaugural lecture, on November 15, 1930, which was entitled “The Causes of the Racial Decline of the German People Since the Migration of Peoples.” On April 1, 1931, Frick’s time in government in Thuringia came to an abrupt end, after the DVP joined a motion of no confidence proposed by the Social Democrats and Communists. Yet it was not Frick’s actions as a minister that caused the coalition to break up, but rather the insulting remarks made by Gauleiter Sauckel in an editorial in the party newspaper Der Nationalsozialist (The National Socialist). After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. In it, Sauckel had belittled representatives of the DVP as “foolish old men, traitors, and swindlers,” who “in their bottomless impudence were playing a sacrilegious game with the fate of our people.” This proved too much even for a party that had endured months of Frick’s provocations. Amid considerable press attention, Hitler had traveled to Weimar the day before the vote to try to change the DVP’s mind, but his trip was in vain. In the parliamentary debate preceding the no-­confidence motion on April 1, Philipp Kallenbach of the DDP described the results of Frick’s fourteen months in government as “downright disastrous.” Kallenbach said: “Peace in our state has been destroyed. The driving force behind these administrative measures is the desire to stir up people and create a spectacle, even to encourage hatred and take one-­sided actions against broad segments of the population. To a great extent in the short time in question, all areas of public life have been politicized in the interests of the Nazi Party. To advance those ends, personnel policy has been ruthless, with allies being permitted to feed at the trough more openly and self-­evidently than ever before.” After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. The affair caused a sensation. A parliamentary inquiry, chaired by SPD politician Hermann Brill, was formed in Weimar to investigate, and Hitler and Frick were summoned as witnesses. The picture that emerged started in the summer of 1930. With State Premier Baum away on vacation, Frick had sought to lay the groundwork for Hitler’s naturalization by appointing him gendarmerie commissioner in the town of Hildburghausen, while at the same time releasing him from all duties as a civil servant. Two ministry officials were ordered to initiate the necessary formalities under “strictest official secrecy.” The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. At a regional Nazi meeting in Gera on July 12, 1930, Frick presented Hitler with the certificate of appointment, and he confirmed receipt with his signature. Afterward, however, the Nazi leader apparently had second thoughts, worrying that the title of gendarmerie commissioner might make him look ridiculous. In any case, he tore up the document a few days later in Munich. Before the committee of inquiry, he testified that he had not wanted to accept the appointment in the first place. The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. “Lots of hounding in the press,” an annoyed Goebbels noted. “Crazy caricatures.” The affair was mocked as a “presumptuous masquerade” and a “prank.” But an editorial in the liberal Vossische Zeitung drew attention to the deadly serious underlying meaning. With his “unsuccessful push” to make Hitler a German, Frick had once again proved that the National Socialists were unwilling to abide by the law. “It would be good if the true character of this party were finally recognized outside Bavaria, where people have experienced it up close,” the paper wrote. In Thuringia, no one heeded the warning. In the state elections in late July 1932, the NSDAP emerged as the strongest party, with 42.5 percent of the vote, and Sauckel became state premier. Looking back, the Social Democratic politician, journalist, and later member of the anti-­Nazi resistance Hermann Brill described the “Frick era” in Thuringia as “one of the most important vanguard skirmishes in the great battle between democracy and dictatorship.” Indeed, during his time in office, Frick delivered a foretaste of what could be expected if the National Socialists came to power nationally. For fourteen months, Thuringia served as a laboratory in which they could try out measures they were to implement on a larger scale at Reich level three years later. In a personal letter dated April 2, 1931, Hitler thanked Frick for “placing Thuringia at the center of Germany’s national, political, and economic redevelopment.” The Nazi leader added, “We all firmly believe in the hour that will once again, this time forever, call you to serve our people in a responsible position.” And Frick was in fact rewarded with the post of Reich minister of the interior—­one of the most powerful positions in the land—­in the “cabinet of national concentration” formed on January 30, 1933, under Germany’s new chancellor, Hitler. __________________________________ Excerpted from Fateful Hours: The Collapse of the Weimar Republic.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.
