Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D. Cal.), the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit charges Rocket Lab as well as certain of Rocket Lab’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.

Title: The Nasdaq 100 Big Caps’ Big Price Drops: Apple, Meta, Nvidia Tesla

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. Nasdaq 100 These Nasdaq 100 Big Caps peaked months ago and have dropped in price steadily since then. Each stock has a separate, individual story but the Trump tariffs and their effects on prices play a big part on all of them. Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the resulting inflation may affect interest rate policy. It’s not a good mix, according to investors who have shown their dislike by selling the shares of these well-known names. What had been hot stocks are now in the cold as ice territory as the price charts show serious downtrends for each. Wall Street is having second thoughts. Apple Apple daily price chart, 4 19 25 The early April slide below the August 2024 low near 195 is quite dramatic. The gap down from about $220 to just above$205 demonstrates the emotional quality to the selling. That buyers did not show up again until stock reached just below $170 does not instill confidence despite the short bounce that followed. That bounce failed to fill the gap down and the price remains below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The tiny red circle shows the spot in early April where the former crossed below the latter, indicating the extent of trend weakness. The iPhone maker has been wounded by the Trump tariffs. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms daily price chart, 4 19 25. Meta Platforms Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Controlling Shareholder Mark Zuckerberg cannot be too happy with the recent stock performance of the company. From the February peak of $740 to the current $501 is a two-month drop of 32%. The 50-day moving average is down trending as of late March/early April. The red-dotted line connects the February top with the April high and shows the serious downward slant of the price. Are we about to witness a re-test of the August 2024 low just below the $460 level? Nvidia Nvidia daily price chart, 4 19 25. The semiconductor giant peaked in January at $152.50 and now goes for $101.49. For those who bought then and continue to hold, that’s a 33% loss. Note that since from that top to early April, the price has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a down trend. The 50-day moving average in mid-March crossed below the 200-day moving average, a further indication of the downward direction of trend. Although the price bounced upward for a few days, it failed to cross above the moving averages. It’s a negative as well that the April low dropped below the August 2024 low. Tesla Tesla daily price chart, 4 19 25. The November/December 2024 upward movement bears a certain resemblance to the Seig Heil hand gesture made in public in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Since the mid-December peak of $480 the stock has dropped to its present $241. That’s a 41% loss for those who purchased then and held on. The red circle shows where the 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, an indication of trend weakness. Tesla has managed to stay above the August 2024 low, better than some of the other Nasdaq 100 big caps. A close below that level would not be pleasing to remaining investors.

Title: How To Find Massive Dividend Deals In The Tariff Panic

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Red Tariffs newspaper headlines with assorted economy related topics On one front, this tariff pandemonium changes nothing for us: We still see our favorite high-yield investments—8%+ paying closed-end funds (CEFs)—as the best choice to anchor your retirement portfolio. In fact, times like this add to their appeal even more. That’s because, in a crash, we CEF investors don’t have to sell a single unit of our funds to get the cash we need to fund our lives. Our big dividends—many of which roll in monthly—take care of our needs for us. Then there’s CEFs’ discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). This unique-to-CEF measure tells us when a fund is cheap or pricey. And right now, thanks to the tariff panic, we’ve got a raft of discounted CEFs to choose from. And there’s one more edge we can exploit with CEFs: the fact that CEF investors are very conservative and lean heavily toward funds with long track records. This tendency to go with the tried-and-true opens up an opportunity for us. That’s because many CEF firms, like Nuveen, PIMCO and BlackRock, have CEFs of all ages in their stables. Here’s the thing, though: Whether the fund is “young” or “old,” they all tend to be run by the exact same people! So we can, in effect, buy a younger CEF and take advantage of its discount. Then we simply ride along as it ages, and its valuation nears that of its older sibling. Let’s zero in on this opportunity by looking at three CEFs from PIMCO, a California-based firm that’s long had a grip on CEF investors’ imaginations: the PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund (PTY), PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS) and PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX). PIMCO’s “brand halo” makes it difficult to buy its funds at a discount. Let’s start with PTY, far and away the oldest of our trio. Launched over 20 years ago, PTY sports an 11.2% yield that investors, well, love. It’s also by far the biggest of the three, with $2.3 billion in assets under management, compared to $910 million for PDX and $665 million for PAXS. On the other side, you have PAXS, with a 12.3% yield, and PDX, which yields 7.9%. PAXS launched at the start of 2022, and PDX is a bit older, having held its IPO in 2019. But even that 2019 date is young by CEF standards; it makes PDX the second-youngest PIMCO CEF on the market. But PTY overshadows its two younger siblings because its age lets investors analyze its long-haul payout history. And that history is very favorable indeed: PTY Dividend Here you can see that PTY’s payouts have been pretty steady over 20 years, which included the pandemic, the subprime-mortgage crisis, and the low interest rates of the 2010s. (The spikes and dips in the purple line above are special dividends.) While it’s true that the regular payouts have dipped a bit (cut 13.6% since the fund’s IPO), the average annualized yield on PTY has been 11.3% for investors who bought at the IPO date, as of this writing. To put that in perspective, someone who bought $100,000 worth of PTY has earned, on average, an income stream of $945 per month (a bit over $11,300 per year) without having to do a single thing. So, you can see why PTY has attracted a premium to NAV throughout its history. This simply means investors are willing to pay more for PTY than its portfolio is worth. It makes sense when you think about it: PTY gives investors a steady paycheck, which encourages them to stick with the fund. As a result, there are fewer shares of PTY on the market, since CEFs—unlike ETFs—tend to have a fixed share count over their lifespans. This means PTY’s market price tends to drift upward more than its NAV does. Although that’s been going up too: PTY Total Returns In total, PTY has earned an 11.7% annualized return on a NAV basis, as of this writing. That’s higher than the 11.3% average yield investors have received, so you can see how PTY has been able to maintain payouts for over two decades. To be clear, for every dollar put in PTY, over $10 in profit has been generated. When you consider that, the fund’s premium to NAV makes even more sense. And it follows that this premium would survive the tariff mayhem: PTY’s record is just too good. Now let’s shift back to the younger PAXS and PDX. They don’t have the track records to attract investors like PTY does, even though they’re managed by the same people. That’s why we have seen PAXS’s premium all but disappear amid the tariff panic, while PDX’s discount has grown wider. PIMCO Discounts This is a clear buy signal, but let me back that call up with another chart showing these funds’ dividend histories. PDX/PAXS Dividend History Now before we go further, yes, PDX’s dividend line (in orange) looks a bit wonky. There are two reasons for that: One, the fund launched just before the pandemic and, at the end of 2020, it cut its distribution by more than half. Two, PDX moved from quarterly payouts to monthly dividends in March 2024, so the dividend went from 26 cents, when the fund paid its last quarterly dividend in March 2024, to 11.3 cents a month. That masked a big raise that looks like a dip in the orange line above. PDX Dividend History In reality, PDX increased its payouts by more than 30% in early 2024. PAXS meantime, has seen one hike to its regular dividend since launch, along with a big special payout in late 2022. That “bonus” payout came as the markets were at their most fearful; thanks to PAXS’s focus on debt, it can ensure strong payouts, even when stock markets are panicking. You’d think strong income plays like these would attract buyers, despite their young ages. And they no doubt will—but not now, with the tariffs causing terror among the most conservative investors. That fear has dragged down both funds’ valuations, making both strong buys. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Earnings Season Kicks Into Gear While Tariffs Dominate Markets

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and ... More Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Despite being mired in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 as a group are expected to grow earning at double the pace of the overall market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 32 companies reported earnings last week, heavily emphasizing bank earnings. 71% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the first-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 121 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, marking the second busiest week of the reporting season. S&P 500 Earnings Season The financial sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement, while downward revisions to the technology sector offset the improvement. According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 7.2% year-over-year, equal to the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have faded as concerns about earnings and sales have increased due to the increased tariffs. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Tariff worries weighed on stocks with a 1.5% decline last week. After this week’s pullback, the S&P 500 sits 14% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed last week. The group remains in bear market territory at 26.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns Much was made of the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness in the previous week. The typical doomsayers came out in force to predict some new apocalypse, but several less frightening factors seemed to be at play. Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was back to behaving more typically, with yields falling during the stock market weakness. Most of the decline in yields was from a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors, which reversed some of the increase from the previous week. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning US Treasuries. Usually, this happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks during these periods. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Recently, there has also been some gnashing of teeth about the US dollar’s depreciation against other currencies. This caused the alarmists to spread worries about the US dollar falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. Indeed, the tariffs or falling US yields could result in some rebalancing within currency reserves, but any dethroning of the king dollar remains a minuscule probability. The fact is that there is currently no suitable replacement for the US dollar. This does not mean the US should abuse its status, but overwrought concerns are not yet warranted. A longer-term history of the dollar shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999! US Dollar Woes? Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow 14.8% year-over-year versus 7.2% for the rest of the S&P 500. The blended earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent 7 is 5.1%. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the second busiest week of reporting season has a plethora of notable companies scheduled, including 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Procter & Gamble (PG), and PepsiCo (PEP). According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. The healthcare sector is benefiting from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which are both expected to swing from losses in the same quarter last year to profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. If these two companies are excluded, the earnings growth rate for healthcare would be 3.6% according to FactSet. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.3% has slightly undershot expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, once the distortions from the healthcare sector’s accounting are removed, the technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector With relatively few top-tier economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. Markets remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs should be positively correlated with the extent of economic growth headwind. Actual economic data has remained relatively resilient despite the tariff storm. On the other hand, soft data from surveys shows the reasons for the consternation about the economic outlook. For example, consumer sentiment readings have plunged. While this plunge does not guarantee an impending recession, it points to at least some economic softness if the 2022 period is a proper corollary. Consumer Sentiment Consumer sentiment remains very dependent on the political party of those surveyed. Just as the opposite was the case under President Biden in 2022, Democratic sentiment has plunged relative to Republicans under President Trump. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party This week’s earnings reports should provide insight into additional sectors and two of the Magnificent 7. With the tariff overhang and growing concerns about the resilience of the artificial intelligence wave, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched even more closely. Consensus earnings growth estimates for the calendar year 2025 earnings have been reduced, even though the first quarter's earnings have arrived as expected thus far. Generally, at 14% off their highs, stocks expect these tariffs to be temporary and a passing headwind for earnings. This expectation could be valid, but there could be more downside if elevated tariffs are viewed as more permanent and likely to send the global economy into recession. Upside could come from significant trade deals that lessen the headwinds or a pivot from the administration away from tariffs. The short-term forecast for stocks seems even more impossible to predict than ever, but the long-term outlook is almost certainly not at risk. Stocks have outperformed cash, bonds, and inflation by a wide margin over the long term despite many setbacks, many much scarier than tariffs or recession.

Binance has also "been approached by quite a lot" of countries to "[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto," Teng added. Trump has made passing long-awaited crypto legislation a priority for his second administration, as well as signing an executive order that calls for the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile. “Compared to many other jurisdictions, [the U.S. is] way ahead on that front,” Teng said, adding it’s spurred countries into action. In March, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick predicted the bitcoin price could surge to $500,000 per bitcoin within three years due to the creation of a U.S. bitcoin and crypto reserve. Earlier this month, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan revealed CZ, who still holds a majority stake in Binance, had begun advising them on developing crypto regulations and adoption of bitcoin and crypto. “It makes sense that countries would reach out to industry players to ensure they have informed views on policy,” Anthony Pompliano, the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, said in an emailed note. “This is the game theory that bitcoiners have been talking about for decades. Once one large nation starts to acquire bitcoin, all countries are incentivized to compete to acquire bitcoin … it is not possible to ignore the United States of America—the greatest economy ever constructed in human history. If America says bitcoin is strategically important, then other countries will start seeing the asset that way as well." This month, Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential council of advisers for digital assets, said the U.S. is exploring many ways to increase its bitcoin reserve without using additional taxpayer dollars, including through tariff revenue and revaluing the government’s gold certificates.

More far higher than where it was before the November U.S. election. “We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there’s literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said in an interview with Pompliano. “Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it’s not happening in a silo," David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher BTC Inc, which also organizes the bitcoin conference at which Trump first proposed the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, said in a statement teasing the upcoming Las Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference. "President Trump’s establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many steps he’s taken to promote American innovation," Bailey said. In January, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. Last year, BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto said sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in bitcoin alongside wild speculation that Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund was exploring buying bitcoin.

Title: Big bets on speculative carbon capture tech ignore today’s solutions

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The first step in reducing the risks of climate change is cutting carbon emissions. The world hit a notable milestone on that front, with global energy-related emissions likely peaking last year, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Now, the world’s carbon pollution is likely to begin a long, inexorable decline over the coming decades. But there’s a catch: Emissions almost certainly won’t fall fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5 C target set in the Paris Agreement. Increasingly, hitting that target looks like it will require the world to turn to technologies that can suck carbon straight from the air in a bid to turn the global thermostat down. Investors have spent years laying the groundwork to develop a sector that has the potential to undergird carbon markets that BNEF estimates could reach $1.1 trillion in the coming decades. Companies from Occidental Petroleum to Microsoft along with firms like BlackRock and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures are among the investors throwing billions at startups. The U.S. government has been a significant patron, with the Energy Department committing more than $1 billion to get carbon removal off the ground. But funding and buyers of carbon removal services have so far targeted a narrow subset of techniques to clean the atmosphere. And U.S. federal support is now up in the air as the Donald Trump administration pursues funding cuts to all manner of climate programs. This is happening in what is shaping up to be a formative period for the carbon removal industry as companies attempt the perilous journey from pilot projects to commercialization, said Robert Hoglund, co-founder of carbon removal clearinghouse CDR.fyi. To ensure the industry has a fighting chance to reach the scale needed, it will need an enormous financial boost. "If we don’t get new buyers, we’re stuck in the seed stage,” he said. There are at least eight broad categories for removing carbon to clean up the atmosphere, with more than 900 startups trying different approaches. The money that's been rushing into the carbon chase has overwhelmingly backed a technique known as direct air capture (DAC), which involves using machines to suck up carbon. Firms are placing major bets on it even though the technology remains unproven at scale, inordinately expensive and energy intensive. Far less investor money is flowing to competing methods such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean and using crushed rocks, a process known as enhanced weathering. Between 2020 to 2024, firms have bet $3.3 billion on DAC compared to $3.4 billion for all other novel approaches, according to publicly available data compiled by CDR.fyi. The technology receives a disproportionate amount of private investment because it’s backed by U.S. federal tax credits and grants, according to Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. That support isn’t because the government decided DAC is the best way to remove carbon, he said, but "because the political economy of the oil and gas industry is much more powerful than these other emerging industries.” Carbon removal buyers looking to meet their climate targets have also not diversified their portfolios. Almost 60% of all purchases tracked by CDR.fyi between 2019 and 2024 are for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It involves burning wood to run power plants, then capturing and sequestering the resulting emissions underground. Hence, the CO2 the trees and plants pull from the atmosphere during their lifetimes stays put. Despite the interest, research has found that cutting down and transporting feedstock can emit more carbon than it sequesters, making carbon accounting a big challenge. BECCS made up about 85% of Microsoft’s 8.2 million metric ton portfolio for novel carbon removal through 2024 tracked by CDR.fyi. The technique "offers attractive costs with an achievable scale inside the 2030 timeline,” said Brian Marrs, the company’s senior director of energy and carbon removal. Bioenergy plants already exist, and retrofitting them for carbon capture is arguably faster than building and scaling novel carbon removal technology. Since 2024, Microsoft has only added to its BECCS portfolio, signing a landmark 6.75 million ton deal with Houston-based developer Fidelis New Energy earlier this month to purchase removal from a plant being built near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It’s the largest deal for novel carbon removal to date. The company also recently added another 3.7 million ton purchase from CO280 Solutions, which captures CO2 from pulp and paper mills, reflecting Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its climate commitments. Microsoft takes a "portfolio approach” to procuring carbon removal, balancing costs, deployment timelines and scale potential for different methods, Marrs said, adding that the company also purchases nature-based carbon credits in addition to engineered removals. BECCS’s dominance is not to say DAC or other technologies haven’t seen big purchases. According to CDR.fyi, Oxy subsidiary 1PointFive has sold 1.3 million tons of carbon removal services to companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Airbus, making it the largest DAC purveyor. Its next-closest competitors, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, have each sold a bit more than a quarter of that amount. Yet these approaches have yet to live up to their promise. Through 2024, DAC delivered around 1,200 tons of CO2 removal — less than 0.2% of all carbon removed over that time frame — and BECCS has delivered 10,000 tons — less than 1.7% of the total — per CDR.fyi. Just a handful of companies are buying the bulk of carbon removal credits. Microsoft alone is responsible for the majority of carbon removal purchases to date, though Alphabet’s Google and Stripe are also among major buyers. That’s because durable removal isn’t cheap. Using DAC can cost upwards of $1,000 per ton of CO2. Compare that to standard forest carbon credits, which are often sold for under $10. "The only way to make this scale is to make it mandatory,” said Wim Carton, an associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden. Carbon removal is a public good governments should treat as akin to a "trash removal service,” said Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global public policy and external affairs. That approach should also include sticks, he added, much like littering results in a fine. But with Trump — who has called former President Joe Biden’s climate legislation "the green new scam” — the odds of the U.S. doubling down on climate regulation are low. What climate scientists want investors and entrepreneurs to understand is that carbon removal has a narrow set of appropriate use cases. The first is cleaning up legacy emissions. Decades of humanity’s CO2 is lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. If the Earth were an overflowing bathtub, turning the faucet off — cutting emissions — wouldn’t be enough to stop the water from spilling over. You also need to open the drain. The second use is for the unavoidable, steady drip of CO2 for decades from sectors like agriculture and aviation. All other applications of carbon clean-up technologies could do more harm than good since they risk slowing down emissions cuts today by promising removals down the road, Carton said. That’s especially true for using captured CO2 to extract more fossil fuels, a practice that climate researchers agree needs to be rapidly wound down. Exactly how much carbon the world needs to remove from the atmosphere depends on how quickly that happens. In a scenario where humanity dramatically curbs emissions, scientists estimate that 4.8 billion tons of CO2 removal will be needed annually by mid-century to keep the climate stable with all of it coming from conventional methods like planting trees. In what’s an increasingly likely scenario of continuing to burn fossil fuels, the planet will require almost 9.8 billion tons annually to compensate for the added emissions with 3.5 billion of that from novel techniques like DAC. The world is nowhere near that. Through 2024, about 13 million tons of carbon removal credits have been sold since CDR.fyi began tracking the market for novel carbon removal, what Cullenward called "a rounding error.” The clock is ticking on scaling that up. "We’re far too late, and we’ve eaten up too much of the carbon budget to say that we don’t need it,” said Sabine Fuss, co-chair of the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. While DAC and BECCS are attracting the most investment and purchases respectively, they’re crowding out other promising carbon removal technologies. Some startups use clever engineering to accelerate natural processes, like increasing the ocean’s alkalinity. Others are electrolyzing seawater and spreading crushed basalt rock over farmland. These methods promise greater durability, verifiability and effectiveness of storing CO2 than simply planting trees. Another method has provided the majority of all carbon removal delivered: biochar. It’s done so without the support of U.S. tax credits, large purchases from brand-name buyers or billions in investments. In some ways, biochar is the "unrecognized star” of carbon removal, said Carton. Compared to other methods, it’s cheap and doesn’t require much upfront capital expenditure or high-tech research and development. Making it requires kilns to heat biomass, and the resulting charcoal-like product can also be used to help improve soil fertility. But like all carbon removal techniques, there are downsides, the biggest being uncertainty about how much CO2 stays sequestered when it’s added to different soils. That’s an area of active investigation for researchers. "It’s got so much potential, but it’s inconclusive,” said Ben Kolosz, an assistant professor in renewable energy and carbon removal at the University of Hull in the U.K. Still other methods like ocean alkalinity enhancement and enhanced rock weathering hold even greater promise to capture and store vast amounts of CO2. But they are not as "approachable” or "intuitive” as technologies like DAC, which may give investors and would-be buyers pause, said Anu Khan, founder and executive director of the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative. CDR.fyi’s Hoglund compared the carbon removal industry’s efforts to the pharmaceutical industry's pursuit of new drugs. "You need huge upfront investments for it to work,” said Hoglund, who is also the manager of the Milkywire Climate Transformation Fund, an organization that supports carbon removal, decarbonization and nature-based projects. That ultimately means securing committed buyers with deep pockets. "We need many Microsofts to start scaling this,” he said.

Title: Trump's trade war is spooking first-time investors. 4 need-to-know tips for stock-market newcomers.

Investing your money in the stock market is a great way to grow your wealth in the long term, and the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to compound. While that sounds straightforward, current market conditions might give aspiring investors reason for pause. The S&P 500 is down almost 10% year-to-date as stocks continue to sell off from trade war concerns. Kristen Jauregui made it her goal to start investing this year, but she's been discouraged by the market volatility and has decided to wait until things calm down before buying in. The possibility of investing money into the market and immediately seeing it shrink after another tariff negotiation triggers a sell-off is unappealing to her. "It's something that I had been trying to get involved in because it's time to diversify my assets, it's time to grow my money so I have a better future later on, but with the way that everything is shifting right now, I get anxiety reading the news," Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist, told Business Insider. Harry Woodland started investing in stocks during the week of April 7, just as tariff news was swinging the market wildly. He began by buying ETFs tracking the global stock market and individual companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), he said. "I'm actually investing a little bit after the tariffs came out, so I'm sort of catching up," the 27-year-old, who runs a landscaping business, told BI. "I definitely have concerns about the whole geopolitical situation. It's a very, very volatile market right now." If you're in a similar boat to Jauregui and Woodland, fear not. Katie Klingensmith, the chief investment strategist at Edelman Financial Engines, has the following advice for those who are looking to dip their toes into investing but aren't sure how to start. The most important thing is having a regular plan, according to Klingensmith. It could be as simple as putting $50 into your portfolio every paycheck, as long as you're following a consistent buying schedule — a practice known as dollar cost averaging where you buy when the market is both up and down. This will create healthy financial habits and help you build up your portfolio at a steady pace, she said. "Even if they're relatively small amounts, over the long term those compound dramatically, so investing a little bit early can make a huge difference over the long run," Klingensmith said. You might be tempted to save up your cash and wait until you have a larger sum to invest, but that's not necessary and might actually be suboptimal. It's hard to time the market correctly and enter at the right point. "If you're systematically buying every paycheck, then sometimes you're going to be buying at the absolute cheapest point, sometimes at a medium point, and sometimes at a more expensive point," Klingensmith said. It's OK to not buy in at the low all the time — dollar cost averaging helps investors smooth out the cost of investing. If it's your first foray into the stock market, stick with the basics, like index funds, ETFs, and blue-chip stocks, Klingensmith said. For those with a longer investing horizon, it makes sense to have a higher risk tolerance as there's more time to weather the ups and downs of the market. Younger investors can often put up to 100% of their portfolio into equities and gradually dial down the risk as they age. Woodland's applying this mindset to his investing strategy and taking some risks on individual stocks while he's young. "The Big Tech stuff in my portfolio does worry me a bit, but it's offset by my recovery period. I've got a long time to invest," Woodland told Business Insider. Steer clear of the more complicated investment vehicles though, Klingensmith warns. "Lots of people are talking about private credit, private debt, or real estate," Klingensmith said. "It doesn't tend to be for the smaller investor because at least at this point, those investments are hard to get into and out of." Examples of index funds that provide broad exposure to the market include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT), and the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH). Staying diversified sounds deceptively simple, but it's often hard to heed this tip when the stock market is doing well. For example, if you started investing last year, you might have been tempted to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to Magnificent Seven stocks due to their stellar performance. Now, you might be wishing that you had more exposure to the utilities sector. While it's exciting to invest thematically, such as betting big on the AI trend, that's not the best foundation to base your portfolio on, according to Klingensmith. "The winners within the stock market change. Five years ago nobody would have dreamed that AI would have been this much of a leader in 2024," Klingensmith said. "If you are purchasing a broad basket of securities, you're much more likely to have some winners." Both institutional and retail investors had been betting on US exceptionalism fueling stocks in the last couple of years, but the trade war has proven that the strategy isn't watertight. "Honestly, prior to the tariffs, I would have invested my money into an S&P 500 fund, but I've actually decided to go for the Invesco FTSE All World fund, mainly because I don't really feel comfortable in investing wholly in US stocks," Woodland said. "Now, I understand that the All World fund is around 60% US stocks. However, I do feel like I can sleep better at night knowing that there is the insurance of having international exposure as well." Before you start investing, you should be aware of your risk tolerance, financial goals, and emotions. Whether you like it or not, investing is an inherently emotional experience, Klingensmith cautions. "I can't say enough that all of us, myself absolutely included, are emotional at times like this, and it's hard not to want to sell investments because they've gone down," she said. Her advice? Don't go for more risky investments if you know you can't handle the stress. Define your financial goals and time horizon, and keep a long-term mindset by avoiding checking on your portfolio daily. Klingensmith added that it's not a bad idea to derisk your portfolio and hold more cash at times. Especially during an economic downturn, keeping cash on hand for easy access can be more valuable than investing in the stock market. "It's OK to focus on that cash cushion in the short term, just given the amount of uncertainty that's everywhere, not just in financial markets," Klingensmith said. Jump to

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.

But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Title: The Rise And Rise Of Reinforcement Learning: AI’s Quiet Revolution

ByPaul X. McCarthy ByPaul X. McCarthy, Contributor. A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it’s not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That’s reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by “warmer” or “colder” hints. This approach isn’t just changing how machines learn; it’s redefining what intelligence means. To grasp Reinforcement Learning’s s ascent, let’s first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning: Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That’s where Reinforcement Learning can help. Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It’s less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained “agent” mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world’s Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don’t exist. It doesn’t need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success. Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity: While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker’s value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic "Wintel" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows. However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT’s performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek’s research quickly gained traction. Their paper, “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources. Reinforcement Learning’s story isn’t just technical but also philosophical. Its trial-and-error mimics human learning, prompting big questions. If machines can replicate this, what defines intelligence? If they spot patterns we can’t, what might we learn about our world? Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, “My PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning… and my team worked on a robot.” His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning’s potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don’t just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn’t a footnote in AI’s story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.

Title: St Mary’s seek to continue storming season by toppling Cork Con

The stakes ratchet up in the All-Ireland League on Saturday as the competition shifts from 18 rounds and eight months of league action to the playoffs in all five divisions. In Division 1A only six points separated the top four and there’s little in the way of a form guide judging by previous clashes. St Mary’s College v Cork Constitution, Templeville Road, live on irishrugby+: Promoted St Mary’s have taken the division by storm (witness 13 try-scoring bonus points in 18 games) to earn a home semi-final against the champions. A single point separated them in the table and ditto in their two meetings; a 27-27 draw at Temple Hill in November and Con’s 30-29 win at Templeville Road in January. St Mary’s fielded a weakened side in Clontarf a fortnight ago but Mark McHugh is expected to recall key man Conor Dean at outhalf and summer signings Greg Jones and Dan Goggin. Con make two changes from their 47-45 win over Terenure. Veteran centre Niall Kenneally is restored and, with Mark Donnelly on Munster duty, David Good starts at loosehead. They are seeking to become the first club to retain the AIL title since Shannon in 2006. Clontarf v Lansdowne, Castle Avenue (4pm) Live on irishrugby+: Emulating Clontarf’s astonishing 49-46 win at the same venue in January will be nigh impossible, as a 12-try rollercoaster was won by Conor Kelly’s penalty with the last kick. Clontarf are seeking to regain the title they won in 2022 before losing in the final a year later, and with a largely rebuilt side. They tend to be clinical after gaining access to the opposition’s 22, and that January extravaganza was one of five games that they have won with the last play. They make just one change to the side that sealed a home semi-final by beating St Mary’s a fortnight ago, with Stephen Ryan starting on the left-wing and two players added to their bench as sides are allowed 23-man squads in the knock-out stages. By contrast, Lansdowne rested most of their frontliners for the win over Garryowen a fortnight ago. Hence, Declan Fassbender recalls 11 players, with Charlie Tector starting at inside centre. Lansdowne, who beat ‘Tarf 26-17 at home back in November, have won eight of their last nine matches as they aim for their first final since 2018. The weather may possibly be more to Clontarf’s liking. City of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Nenagh Ormond v Blackrock College, New Ormond Park: City of Armagh surprisingly slipped into ninth in 1A, whereas UCC climbed into fourth in 1B, on the last day. The students include four recent or current Ireland under-20/Munster academy players in Ben O’Connor, Gene O’Leary Kareem, Seán Odogbu and Michael Foy. Although Nenagh Ormond finished six points above Blackrock, their two wins over them were tight – 38-36 away in September and 21-17 at home three weeks ago. James Blaney is seeking yet another promotion with ‘Rock, who are missing injured Ireland under-20 scrumhalf Oliver Coffey. Cashel v MU Barnhall, Spafield (2.30pm); Dublin University v Greystones, College Park (2.30pm): Cashel and Barnhall also met in last season’s playoffs, the latter winning by two points in Spafield before losing to Queen’s in the playoff final. Barnhall finished second, one point above Cashel, thanks in part to a 30-17 home win over the Tipperary club in January and two bonus points from a 36-33 loss in the February reverse fixture. Trinity are trying to avoid successive relegations and will be favourites at home to Greytones, who finished fourth in 2A. Cashel finished just one point above Barnhall. Dungannon v Clogher Valley, Stevenson Park (2.30pm); Navan v Galwegians, Old Balreask (2.30pm): Navan finished ninth in 2A in their centenary season, and will host Galwegians, who had theirs a year previously, after the Galway club squeezed into fourth in 2B at the end of a fairly luckless campaign in which eight of their nine losses were by a score. Forwards coach Jarrad Butler starts for them, with this season’s Ireland under-20 captain Éanna McCarthy a replacement. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in an Ulster derby after finishing 16 points above them. Midleton v Dolphin, Towns Park (2.30pm); Skerries v Ballyclare, Holmpatrick (2.30pm): Midleton host Dolphin after finishing three pints above their Cork rivals courtesy in part to a 15-all draw away and an 18-13 win in Towns Park. Skerries have to reset their sights on the playoffs after slipping into ninth on the final day by points difference while Ballyclare are in bonus territory at the end of their first AIL season.

Title: XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight

With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge. According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. In a recent podcast, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP. The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs. The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments. More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Canary Capital on Friday filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The staking feature of the Canary Staked TRX ETF would allow investors to earn extra yield with their investment. The fund’s “investment objective is to seek to provide exposure to the price of Tron,” the filing said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary has filed for a number of crypto ETFs. The fledgling crypto-focused asset manager is hoping Wall Street’s biggest regulator will give the green light to Sui, Pudgy Penguins, and XRP funds. Those applications are part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, a result of last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have garnered more than $35 billion in net inflows over a 15-month period. The prospectus, also called a registration statement, did not say on which exchange the proposed fund would trade. Staking, the process of pledging proof-of-stake assets to a network to help it function in exchange for rewards, has been a controversial issue in regulators’ consideration of crypto ETFs. Proponents maintain that staking will lead to wider institutional adoption of crypto products, but critics view it as an unnecessary risk for investors. The SEC has yet to approve a staking feature in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator delayed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum. Tron, which trades as TRX and is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was recently trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain, and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares and VanEck are among the long list of major fund issuers currently seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs tracking different digital assets. Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs are the most likely to receive approval next.

Title: Bill Ackman Is Betting on Car Rental Giant Hertz to be a Tariff Winner

President Trump’s auto tariffs may have sparked fears of price hikes among consumers, but some car-buying businesses could actually benefit, according to investor Bill Ackman. The Pershing Square Capital Management founder made a bullish case for Hertz yesterday (April 17), after revealing a nearly 20 percent stake in the car rental company. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Hertz is uniquely well-positioned in the current tariff environment,” Ackman wrote in a post on X. As 25 percent levies on imported cars drive up used car prices, the value of Hertz’s fleet—around 500,000 vehicles worth roughly $1.2 billion—will rise in tandem, he argued. A 10 percent increase in used car values would boost the company’s fleet value by $1.2 billion, nearly half of Hertz’s current market cap. Shares of Hertz surged more than 44 percent following the disclosure of Ackman’s 19.8 percent stake. Hertz has had its fair share of troubles in the past few years. After declaring bankruptcy in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company pivoted hard to electric vehicles—placing a costly bet on Tesla that fell flat due to soft demand. In February, Hertz reported a $2.9 billion loss for 2024 and said it had sold off 30,000 EVs from its fleet. Ackman, who began building his position in the company last year, is betting on a successful turnaround—and a stock price that could more than triple to $30 per share by 2029. That task falls in the hands of Hertz’s new CEO Gil West, who stepped into the role in early 2024. West is focused on “rotating Hertz’s fleet, increasing unit revenues, and reducing operating costs” to “significantly improve profit margins over the next several years,” Ackman said. In a note to employees today (April 18), West praised Ackman’s support and described it as an “testament to our progress,” according to Bloomberg. Ackman also highlighted Hertz’s advantageous position in an “oligopoly.” He noted that Hertz and its two rivals, Enterprise and Avis, currently control around 95 percent of the car rental market. Praising Enterprise as the best-run of the trio, Ackman pointed to its estimated 20 percent profit margin as evidence “that the car rental business can be very profitable.” Ackman floated the possibility of a partnership between Hertz and Uber (UBER)—another company Pershing Square has taken a sizable stake in. “What if [Uber] partnered with Hertz on an [autonomous vehicle] fleet roll out over time?” he suggested, hinting at a potential conversation with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. With its large fleet, global footprint and expertise in vehicle maintenance, Hertz would “make it an ideal partner” for Uber, Ackman said. Uber seems open to the idea. “Hertz has been a great partner of ours,” Khosrowshahi responded on X. “Excited to brainstorm on how we can expand our relationship!” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

("Rocket Lab" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: RKLB) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. READ MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy? “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Title: These Groceries Are the Most Likely to Be Affected by Tariffs
URL: https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/these-groceries-are-most-likely-to-be-affected-by-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T20:44:00Z
Full Content:
We asked an agriculture and economics expert about where consumers can expect food price hikes in the future. Grocery prices may rise even further if Trump's tariffs go back into effect. President Donald Trump's trade war has been a wild-moving target with severe economic implications. The most recent announcement and subsequent 90-day pause of tariffs affected thousands of imports from dozens of countries and sent the stock market reeling, but what could sweeping tariffs on China and other countries mean for food and grocery prices? Hours before the pause on Trump's newest tariffs was announced, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for everyday shoppers in the US. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are If you're just catching up, on April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. Days later, when the tariffs went into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. While it's still unclear whether the Trump Administration will extend the 90-day pause on the rest of the previously announced tariffs, the large tariff on China could still have an impact on American food costs. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge [or tariff] on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the European Union -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." The tariffs may cause supply issues leading to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Many of the Avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump Administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal promoter of Bitcoin, stoked renewed chatter among crypto circles with his recent enigmatic tweet. Thursday’s message stating merely “Bitcoin is Calling” left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. The company recently acquired 3,450 Bitcoin at a price of $285 million. This was done after a short one-week break from their consistent acquisition pattern. Strategy has been steadfast in its aggressive acquisition strategy despite the fact that nearly all of its crypto acquisitions since November 18 have been made at higher-than-current market prices, according to reports. Saylor’s post might be a tease regarding another future purchase, given his history of sending such sarcastic remarks ahead of new acquisitions. The post also appeared to urge his 4.2 million followers to purchase BTC, which he has frequently called “the future of money.” Bitcoin is Calling. pic.twitter.com/0jo19Qbr5q — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 17, 2025 Strategy’s shares have trounced the performance of America’s largest technology stocks, Saylor’s Wednesday filing showed. The crypto-focused firm has posted an astonishing 130% gain over the last year. These returns more than dwarf the returns of Tesla (57%), NVIDIA (30%), Apple (17%), Meta (4%), and Alphabet (2%). There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7. pic.twitter.com/TlD57hW0w0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 15, 2025 Some top tech firms actually lost value during the same period. Amazon and Microsoft saw drops of 2% and 7% respectively. These comparisons highlight the significant rewards Strategy has reaped from its heavy crypto investment strategy. The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin’s link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is “the most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.” A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin’s singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as “the most important number in finance.” He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn’t elaborated in coverage. The chairman’s most recent statement comes as Strategy maintains its focus of continuing to buy Bitcoin for the long term, no matter what happens in the short term. With the company’s shares outperforming technology giants and Saylor’s ongoing public support, most crypto observers are now looking to see if another significant purchase of crypto comes after his cryptic “calling” tweet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report. The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards. Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange’s model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins. Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation. The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities. Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions. Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers. Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line. Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area. The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers. In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone. The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets. The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC. As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 18, 2025 14:36 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta's antitrust trial heats up: Here's what we learned in week one
URL: https://qz.com/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-week-1-zuckerberg-1851776650
Time Published: 2025-04-18T18:06:00Z
Full Content:
In week one of the Federal Trade Commission’s blockbuster monopoly trial against Meta (META), CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent around 10 hours on the stand as the agency questioned him about revealing emails from another era. This trial is only just getting started. Throughout it, the FTC will argue that Facebook engaged in a “buy or bury” ploy to eliminate its rivals and gain monopoly power in the social media market. Meanwhile, Meta will make the case that it is responsible for its acquisitions’ runaway successes — and that even after buying Instagram (in 2012) and WhatsApp (in 2014), Meta still faces formidable competition from the likes of TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL). At stake is Zuckerberg’s $1.27 trillion social media empire; if the FTC gets its way, Meta will be forced to give up Instagram and WhatsApp, eliminating “up to half of its ad business,” Jasmine Enberg, vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer, told Quartz earlier this week. The research firm expects Instagram alone to represent 50.5% of Meta’s U.S. ad revenue this year. Instagram and WhatsApp are both critical to Meta’s continued growth as legacy social app Facebook loses momentum with young people. Read on for a look at some of the key takeaways from the trial’s first week, including Zuckerberg’s old emails and the price Meta reportedly tried to pay to avoid the trial altogether. “The FTC kicked off the case with the biggest witness on its list. Only one other witness, the FTC’s economics expert Scott Hemphill, is slated to spend anywhere near as long on the stand as Mr. Zuckerberg,” Holland & Hart antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email to Quartz. “Yet while the FTC confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with cringeworthy emails about Facebook’s schemes to beat back competition in the 2010s, none of that hit the key question: Is Meta currently maintaining a monopoly by virtue of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?” According to Swanson, the agency didn’t get the “critical testimony it needs to show that Meta dominates a narrow market that excludes other social media platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn (MSFT).” Swanson added, “Mr. Zuckerberg deftly described a market in which Meta’s power is checked by competition from those companies.” In one example, Zuckerberg argued on the stand that Meta’s “growth slowed down dramatically” due to the rise of TikTok. In another comment, he said he thinks “people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently.” The FTC brought in old emails sent by the Meta CEO, and in one message Zuckerberg floated the idea of spinning off Instagram. He wrote at the time, “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway.” Zuckerberg added, “While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” These comments contrast Meta’s extensive efforts to keep its “family of apps” together under one proverbial roof. The FTC brought in other Zuckerberg emails as evidence, including a 2011 message that called Instagram a “large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos” and a 2012 message that critiqued the teams led by Facebook’s chief tech officer at the time, Mike Schroepfer. “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s not exactly killing it,” he added, per a CNN (WBD) report. The following year, Facebook’s current chief operating officer, Javier Olivan, shared concerns with Zuckerberg about WhatsApp’s growth. Messages presented in court, according to The Hill, show that Olivan told Zuckerberg that he’d “been thinking hard about this for the past couple of sleepless nights since I am really worried … these guys are the real deal,” he said. Zuckerberg was reportedly worried at the time that WhatsApp could offer features similar to Facebook and “start winning in the U.S. and other markets.” Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and Vanderbilt’s associate dean for research, told Quartz on Thursday: “So far, the government has done a good job using Zuckerberg’s own words against him, and he has done a good job deflecting them to the degree possible.” “But there is only so much Zuckerberg can do now to walk back on what he said then,” Allensworth added. “These are the worst facts of the case from Meta’s perspective, and the government laid some important blows.” Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former chief operating officer, also took the stand this week. There, the FTC confronted Sandberg about a message she sent in 2011, when Google debuted its now-defunct Facebook clone. Remarking on Google+, she reportedly told staffers that “the most important thing to acknowledge is that for the first time we have real competition and consumers have real choice.” About a year later, Sandberg said she “would block Google” from advertising its rival on Facebook, according to court evidence published by Bloomberg. Sandberg argued that these messages weren’t about putting its rivals at a disadvantage. “I said that to rally the troops,” she countered. Lots of interesting bits surfaced this week. In 2022, for example, Zuckerberg floated purging users’ friend lists as a “potentially crazy idea” to breathe some life into Facebook, according to evidence presented in the trial. Zuckerberg reasoned at the time that “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” could reinvigorate engagement on the service, but it never came to pass. In a call to the FTC’s chair Andrew Ferguson, Zuckerberg tried to convince the agency to settle its antitrust case for $450 million — and later $1 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The FTC, meanwhile, was looking for a settlement worth 30 times as much, per the Journal. Going forward, “the big thing I’m looking for is some expert testimony on what is the right way to think about the market here and Meta’s alleged monopoly power,” Allensworth said. “So far, on that front, we only have testimony by executives at Meta and potential other competitor (like YouTube) about their perceptions of whether Meta faces meaningful competition from social media companies that are not ‘personal,’ like TikTok and YouTube.” Allensworth added, “Judges tend to put a lot of stock in expert opinion in antitrust cases, especially when it comes to market definition and monopoly power.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stream ingest data from Kafka to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using custom connectors
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/stream-ingest-data-from-kafka-to-amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-using-custom-connectors/

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by combining the generative AI model’s capabilities with information from external data sources, rather than relying solely on the model’s built-in knowledge. In this post, we showcase the custom data connector capability in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that makes it straightforward to build RAG workflows with custom input data. Through this capability, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports the ingestion of streaming data, which means developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Think of the examples of clickstream data, credit card swipes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, log analysis and commodity prices—where both current data and historical trends are important to make a learned decision. Previously, to feed such critical data inputs, you had to first stage it in a supported data source and then either initiate or schedule a data sync job. Based on the quality and quantity of the data, the time to complete this process varied. With custom data connectors, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage. By avoiding time-consuming full syncs and storage steps, you gain faster access to data, reduced latency, and improved application performance. However, with streaming ingestion using custom connectors, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes such streaming data without using an intermediary data source, making it available almost immediately. This feature chunks and converts input data into embeddings using your chosen Amazon Bedrock model and stores everything in the backend vector database. This automation applies to both newly created and existing databases, streamlining your workflow so you can focus on building AI applications without worrying about orchestrating data chunking, embeddings generation, or vector store provisioning and indexing. Additionally, this feature provides the ability to ingest specific documents from custom data sources, all while reducing latency and alleviating operational costs for intermediary storage. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases allows organizations to build fully managed RAG pipelines by augmenting contextual information from private data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can build applications that are enriched by the context that is received from querying a knowledge base. It enables a faster time to product release by abstracting from the heavy lifting of building pipelines and providing you an out-of-the-box RAG solution, thus reducing the build time for your application. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, which means you can add, update, or delete data in your knowledge base through direct API calls. For this post, we implement a RAG architecture with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using a custom connector and topics built with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for a user who may be interested to understand stock price trends. Amazon MSK is a streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it straightforward to run Apache Kafka applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution enables real-time analysis of customer feedback through vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). The following architecture diagram has two components: Preprocessing streaming data workflow noted in letters on the top of the diagram: Runtime execution during user queries noted in numerals at the bottom of the diagram: The implementation follows these high-level steps: To build a generative AI stock analysis tool with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases custom connector, use instructions in the following sections. To try this architecture, deploy the AWS CloudFormation template from this GitHub repository in your AWS account. This template deploys the following components: In the precreated MSK cluster, the required brokers are deployed ready for use. The next step is to use a SageMaker Studio terminal instance to connect to the MSK cluster and create the test stream topic. In this step, you follow the detailed instructions that are mentioned at Create a topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. The following are the general steps involved: To create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps: Now, using API calls, you configure the consumer Lambda function so it gets triggered as soon as the input Apache Kafka topic receives data. The Apache Kafka consumer Lambda function reads data from the Apache Kafka topic, decodes it, extracts stock price information, and ingests it into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base using the custom connector. Now that the required setup is done, you trigger the workflow by ingesting test data into your Apache Kafka topic hosted with the MSK cluster. For best results, repeat this section by changing the .csv input file to show stock price increase or decrease. If the data ingestion and subsequent processing is successful, navigate to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases data source page to check the uploaded information. Within the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases console, you have access to query the ingested data immediately, as shown in the following screenshot. To do that, select an Amazon Bedrock FM that you have access to. In my case, I chose Amazon Nova Lite 1.0, as shown in the following screenshot. When it’s completed, the question, “How is ZVZZT trending?”, yields the results based on the ingested data. Note how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases shows how it derived the answer, even pointing to the granular data element from its source. To make sure you’re not paying for resources, delete and clean up the resources created. In this post, we showed you how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, through which developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully managed, end-to-end RAG workflows to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company’s data sources. With this capability, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync, and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

Time Published: 2025-04-18T15:16:10Z

By BERNARD CONDON, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Friday, April 18th, 2025 As the Western hemisphere wound down trading activity with the onset of the Easter holidays, crude oil markets have posted an impressive 7% week-on-week rise, with ICE Brent now back at $68 per barrel. New OPEC+ compensation quotas, tighter US sanctions on Iran, and relatively upbeat March macro data have all boosted sentiment in the short term, although further US-China escalation could upend this week’s recovery. US Ratchets Up Pressure on Iran. The Trump Administration issued new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports, including the Shengxing Chemical teapot refinery based in Shandong province for purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, the second Chinese refiner to be hit with direct sanctions. EIA Is Bleeding People After DOGE Check. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is reported to have lost more than 100 employees in the latest round of resignation offers put forward by Elon Musk’s DOGE drive, possibly losing up to 40% of the EIA’s 350 employees, putting data publications at risk. Mauritania Exports Its First Ever Gas Cargo. UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) has finally loaded its first LNG shipment - aboard the British Sponsor LNG carrier - from the 2.3 mtpa Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) facility offshore Mauritania, following a six-week delay to the export terminal’s commissioning. Equinor’s US Wind Ambitions Dissipate. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated a halt to construction of the Empire Wind offshore project developed by Norway’s state oil firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) off the New York Coast, citing insufficient environmental analysis before approval. BlackRock Gets Ready to Buy Up Utilities. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to own major stakes of public utility companies, a joint 2023 motion of 16 Republican-led states decrying its ESG investing demands on utility companies. Bahrain Resumes LNG Imports. Despite being a producer of oil and sharing a huge oil field with Saudi Arabia, the Middle Eastern kingdom of Bahrain is set to resume importing LNG after a five-year hiatus, with a 170,000 m3 cargo from the US Sabine Pass LNG facility moving towards the Arab Gulf. Europe Has Now Only Two Russian Buyers. The Czech Republic has officially halted its imports of Russian crude after the Transalpine pipeline (TAL) from Italy’s Trieste boosted throughput capacity to 900,000 b/d, with Czech refiners now getting all of their oil needs from the seas. Congo Taps Blackwater Know-How. Erik Prince, the founder of private military firm Blackwater, has allegedly signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure the country’s vast metal reserves and reduce cross-border smuggling of commodities amidst ongoing warfare in Eastern Congo. Trading Firms Eye Italian Refinery Sale. Global commodity traders Glencore (LON:GLEN) and Gunvor are considering buying Italy’s API downstream firm, operating two refineries in Ancona and Trecate, totalling 200,000 b/d in capacity, with Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR also keen to purchase the asset. Force Majeure Saps Malaysia’s LNG Supply. Malaysia’s Petronas, operator of the giant 29.3 mtpa Bintulu LNG export terminal, is experiencing production issues due to boiler malfunction, setting a pricing floor for Asia’s JKM gas futures that are set to rebound from their 9-month low of $12 per mmBtu. China Hits New Coal Record. China posted another all-time high in coal production as the March supply totals amounted to 440.6 million tonnes, up 9.6% from a year ago, worsening the country’s coal oversupply and forcing power utilities to cut their coal imports by 6% month-over-month in March. Refiners Flee California Regulatory Hell. US refining giant Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) filed its request to ‘idle, restructure or cease’ operations at its 170,000 b/d Benicia refinery next to San Francisco by April 2026, marking the second refinery closure in California in less than a year amidst rising regulatory costs. America’s Copper Dream Is On. Following years of stalling and controversy, the Trump administration is set to approve a land swap that would pave the way for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and its project partner BHP (NYSE:BHP) to launch one of the world’s largest copper mines, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona. Ukraine Signs Watered-Down Minerals Deal. Ukrainian authorities stated that Kyiv and Washington have signed a memorandum of intent on developing mineral resources in the Eastern European country, aiming for the establishment of a Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with a full deal expected next week.

Title: Damn the tariffs! Full speed ahead on AI!

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:58:35Z

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / APRIL 18 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Seemingly oblivious to the faltering economy, new artificial intelligence models kept coming fast and furious this week, especially from OpenAI — and apparently they’re pretty popular. China’s DeepSeek? Not so much, at least with the U.S. government, as a House committee just labeled it a security threat. In perhaps a sign that its massive funding is burning a hole in its pocket, OpenAI is also looking at creating a social network. Perhaps Sam Altman sees an opening, given that TikTok still faces having to shut down in the U.S. and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to pay off the FTC to drop its antitrust lawsuit this week, which could force it to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But honestly I don’t really get it any more than I get Elon Musk trying to goose Grok by connecting it to X. IPOs surprisingly aren’t quite dead yet, as Figma filed confidentially this week and Kodiak Robotics said it will go public via a SPAC. But with Trump kicking the economy into a ditch, it’s hard to see any kind of IPO revival. Meanwhile, the tariff gyrations caused tech stocks to plunge again Wednesday, and the overall market fell Thursday too. Nvidia is producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips in Arizona with TSMC, and it’s building AI supercomputers in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron — both no doubt in the works for years, even if Trump likely will try to take credit. But that won’t help prevent more troubles from tariffs and other trade limitations, as Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion sales hit from limits on shipping its H20 chip to China. AMD also estimates an $800 million charge from U.S. restrictions on China trade, and ASML missed order expectations amid tariff uncertainty. And surely there’s more trouble coming. No wonder Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just hopped on a plane to China to smooth things over with officials and local customers. Private equity is staying busy as the stock market creates bargains and targets: Elliott Management has bought up $1.5 billion worth of HPE’s stock. Suffice to say, expect some changes ahead for HPE. Meantime, Intel sold 51% of Altera to Silverlake for $3.4 billion, at a valuation of $8.75 billion — a big haircut from its original acquisition price of $16.7 billion. Google lost another antitrust case, this one on its ad tech offering. But Google will appeal and ad tech is 17% of its business, so the previous case declaring Google Search a monopoly, which awaits a judge’s remedies, remains the bigger deal. If government agencies can still work together in this day and age, it’s not a stretch that a deal involving both cases could happen in place of years of further litigation. The critical CVE Program for tracking cybersecurity vulnerabilities got a last-minute funding reprieve, but it never should have come to this. It’s hard not to feel that we’re one more bad decision by the confederacy of clowns away from disaster. Infrastructure is still getting some big fundraises: Hammerspace raised a hefty $100 million for its Linux-powered data management platform. And Auradine nabbed $153 million to develop bitcoin mining and AI networking hardware. Tech earnings season gets underway in earnest next week with SAP, Tesla, IBM, ServiceNow, Check Point Software, Pegasystems, Intel and Alphabet. The results won’t be nearly as interesting as the outlooks, which surely won’t be robust. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond, which you can hear and read more about in John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, up on YouTube now.

Title: The Decline of Outside Magazine Is Also the End of a Vision of the Mountain West

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:51:14Z
Full Content:
Four years ago, Robin Thurston, a new owner of Outside, hosted an introductory meeting with the staff of the magazine. Thurston, a tech entrepreneur and a former semi-professional cyclist, Zoomed in from Boulder, where he lives. Much of the staff gathered in the magazine’s offices, in downtown Santa Fe, eager for a glimpse of their new boss. The feeling in the room was hopeful. Like many media products, the magazine had been struggling. The thick print issues of the nineties, fat with ads for Patagonia and Land Rover, had become notably slimmer. Some employees had been furloughed to cut down on costs, and Outside had developed a reputation for not paying freelancers in a timely manner. But it was still publishing award-winning journalism, and had a solid reputation founded on decades of literary and investigative journalism. Around the industry, investors were buying distressed media companies; as far as new owners went, Thurston seemed like a good fit, the kind of guy who was happy to have a meeting that was also a bike ride—if you could keep up with him. “The guy’s a hammer,” one staffer told me. Thurston had sold his first company, MapMyFitness, to Under Armour, in 2013. By the time he purchased Outside, he had already raised more than a hundred and fifty million dollars from venture-capital firms, including Sequoia Heritage, to create a digital hub for the outdoors. He had bought roughly a dozen titles—Backpacker, SKI, Climbing, and Yoga Journal among them—under the umbrella of Pocket Outdoor Media. Outside, the largest in circulation and in prestige, could be the centerpiece. Thurston told the staff that he was changing the name of the company from Pocket Outdoor Media to Outside Interactive, Inc. It was an encouraging step, one that felt like a true commitment. In February, however, Outside, Inc., announced its third round of layoffs in as many years. Nearly the entire Outside editorial team that was in place at the time of the acquisition has now left, transitioned to non-editorial roles, or been laid off. A handful of full-time staffers edit the website; the print magazine, once a monthly but now a quarterly, has just one full-time dedicated editor. In response to the latest layoffs, a group of thirty-six contributing editors, writers, and photographers—including Tim Cahill, E. Jean Carroll, Ian Frazier, Hampton Sides, and Jimmy Chin—signed a letter requesting that their names be removed from the masthead. Some of the signatories had been around for Outside’s seventeen-year run of National Magazine Award nominations (including three consecutive wins for General Excellence), and the publication of stories that became best-selling books, including “The Perfect Storm” and “Into Thin Air,” and movies, including “Blue Crush.” “Your company now seems intent on destroying what Outside once stood for,” the group wrote in an e-mail, on March 10th. (I have written a handful of pieces for Outside’s website, the most recent of which was published in 2019.) “There is this magazine—or there was this magazine—that was a liberating thing, that had a history, and there were all these people who just cared. They really cared so much about it,” Sides told me. In response, Thurston reiterated the company’s “commitment to meaningful storytelling” amid a “changing media landscape” and “substantial headwinds in the media market that impact advertising, subscription, and e-commerce.” But, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former editors, writers, and executives, most of whom requested anonymity—either because they had signed non-disparagement agreements or they feared retaliation—mismanagement and a number of missteps have made a challenging situation worse. “I think there was a fundamental lack of direction or understanding from the C-suite as to what any of these magazines were, why the audiences cared about them or subscribed, and what it takes to tell a good story,” a former employee told me. (Outside, Inc., disputes a number of characterizations in this article, including the idea that in-depth reporting—which a representative claimed “remains fundamental”—is no longer a priority.) Outside was founded, in 1977, by Jann Wenner, who brought on collaborators who had worked with him at Rolling Stone, which he had co-founded ten years previously; they hoped to capitalize on the growing interest in outdoor activities and adventure travel. At the time, there were other publications focussed on the outdoors—Field & Stream had a circulation of nearly two million—but they tended to be either technical and insidery or scandalous and tabloidy. David Quammen, a prominent contributor to Outside, recalled Cahill, a founding editor, referring to the latter as “Jaguars rip my flesh” stories. The magazine saw itself as literary but not self-serious; if the stereotypical National Geographic story was a walk through the jungle recounted in hushed, awed tones, its Outside equivalent was a little dustier, wilder, and less reverent. “Outside always had the feeling that it was apart from the Washington and New York journalism community—it’s there in the name. It was always westward-leaning—you know, getting outside, getting away from big cities, living your life, environmentalism and conservation,” Sides said. “There was always a contrarian aspect to it.” In 1978, Wenner sold the magazine to Larry Burke, a young man from Chicago who had spent a chunk of his twenties vagabonding around Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Burke eventually moved the magazine’s headquarters from Chicago to Santa Fe, where staffers worked out of an adobe-style building with two wood-burning fireplaces and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The magazine’s remit was broad: writers covered mountaineering and triathletes, rodeo queens and road trips. Outside sent Susan Orlean to Spain to meet with a female matador, and Don Katz to Yorkshire to profile a man who held the world record for keeping a ferret in his pants the longest. Quammen, who wrote Outside’s natural-science column for fifteen years, told me, “I would write an essay about something really kind of fringe, like, What’s the sense of identity of a spoon worm? What are the redeeming merits of a mosquito? You know, various weird shit. And the editors, God bless them, would print the stuff.” Mark Bryant was Outside’s editor-in-chief in the nineties, years that seem golden mostly in retrospect. “The business was hard, the work was hard, but it was more straightforward,” Bryant told me. “We could focus on the business at hand, putting out a great magazine for readers, and not, you know, content bundling and data aggregation.” Baby boomers were discovering an apparently bottomless appetite for outdoor sports and adventure travel. The magazine benefitted from this surge in interest, even as some writers expressed misgivings about it. The article that became “Into Thin Air” was an example of this ambivalence. Bryant assigned Jon Krakauer to cover the rapid commercialization of Mt. Everest expeditions, sending him on a trip led by a guide who had agreed to accept the bulk of his fee in the form of future advertising in the magazine. That guide, Rob Hall, ended up dying on the mountain, along with seven other people. Krakauer, traumatized and exhausted, wrote a seventeen-thousand-word article within weeks. The story was memorably clear on the dangers that accompanied the increasing numbers of amateurs on Mt. Everest; the next year, demand for guided trips was higher than ever. Burke, the owner, was often a source of friction. According to former staffers, he was critical of hippies, dirtbag climbers, environmentalists, and stories about animals. But he was also immensely proud of the magazine. During the nineties, the famously stingy Burke rewarded star writers and editors with all-expenses-paid kayaking trips on the Salmon River. Through the years, Burke received multiple offers to sell Outside, but he was always resistant, even as the rise of the internet began to erode circulation and advertising income. At first, the larger audiences available online, especially through social media, made the trade-offs seem worthwhile. “We in the outdoor media—and the media, generally—were kind of selling our souls to the platforms for the distribution, because it was so easy and so cheap,” Christopher Jerard, an original staff member of Freeskier magazine and the current vice-president of marketing at Outside, Inc., said. “Then—surprise, surprise—they turned the spigot off, and we were left with no owned audiences.” By 2020, a person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission estimated, the print edition of the magazine had roughly half as many pages as a few decades earlier; Burke, nearing his eighties, finally decided to sell. When Pocket Outdoor Media began scooping up titles, many of them were still profitable or breaking even, with committed but declining audiences, according to sources familiar with the acquisitions. But Thurston seemed to have bigger ambitions than running a stable of small magazines that more or less broke even. In his initial meeting, he laid out a vision of Outside, Inc., as a tech-media empire, “the Amazon Prime for the active-life-style participant,” with subscription numbers akin to those of Disney+ or Netflix. Rather than depending on the volatile advertising market, the company would get recurring revenue via a membership program, Outside+, which would provide unlimited access to the magazines’ articles and other perks. Thurston has bought up non-media brands, including Gaia, a mapping app; FinisherPix, a photography service; Inntopia, a travel-booking software; and Trailforks, a trail database. (Last year, Thurston also reacquired MapMyFitness, his first company, from Under Armour.) He estimated that the worldwide audience interested in healthy, active life styles was at least a billion people, and argued that the industry was recession-proof. In the first, flush year of Outside, Inc., the company “was acting like a startup, and spending money like a startup,” a former executive told me. It occupied a new, spacious headquarters, on Pearl Street, Boulder’s main drag. Thurston liked to dream big—instead of, say, fifteen Outside, Inc., podcasts, why not a hundred? After years of operating on a shoestring budget, the abundance felt like a relief. The company implemented diversity goals, cleared years of freelancer debt, and committed to becoming carbon-neutral within five years. Amid an atmosphere of near-zero interest rates, venture-capital investors were drawn to grand plans and messianic visions, both of which Thurston was skilled at providing. If the company could convert ten per cent of the brand’s existing audiences into subscribers, he theorized, that would amount to twenty million members. (By comparison, the Times has nearly eleven million digital subscribers.) That goal was ambitious, Thurston conceded during his initial meeting with Outside staffers, but he did expect that, within four or five years, Outside, Inc., would be making three hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue from digital subscriptions alone. (That’s more than the Washington Post and The Atlantic made, combined, in 2024.) When I spoke to Thurston last month, he reminded me that the world was plagued by chronic disease, a loneliness epidemic, and generalized alienation. “I have a fundamental belief, Rachel, that the outdoors can solve many of these problems,” he told me. “I fundamentally feel like, if we can achieve that at scale, it can have a big impact on what’s happening in the world.” Thurston saw the media brands he acquired as the top of a content funnel, the “first touchpoint with the ecosystem,” as he put it. But, from early on, writing was an uneasy fit with the business plan. “You cannot get a return on a hundred and fifty million dollars from niche media,” Caley Fretz, the former editor of CyclingTips, which Outside, Inc., acquired in 2021, told me. “Once you’ve got Sequoia [Heritage] on board, the incentive is for just an insane level of scale, and the media entities were immediately superfluous. The audiences they had weren’t sizable enough, and the structures they operated under were not scalable. It became very obvious that the traditional journalism and editorial focus was going to have to give way.” According to Thurston, a significant amount of Outside, Inc.,’s daily engagement has been on the mapping apps. In 2022, the company went through two rounds of layoffs and ceased print publications of nearly all of its titles, apart from Outside. Outside had built its reputation on investigations and reported essays, and at first it continued to publish these kinds of stories, both in print and online. Sources said that long-form stories got good traffic, as did deeply reported service pieces, like detailed gear reviews. But in-depth reporting seemed to be less of a priority for Thurston, according to former editorial staffers. (When I asked Thurston if there were stories from the old days of Outside that would fit his vision for the magazine, the only example he could name was the piece that became “Into Thin Air.” “Any that come to mind other than Krakauer?” I asked. There was a long, awkward pause, and then Thurston said that he would think about it.) “I think the crux of the problem is he’s running a media business and he fundamentally doesn’t love media,” Felix Magowan, the founder of Pocket Outdoor Media, said. Last January, Outside published an extensive investigation, by Annette McGivney, into a prominent California climber’s long history of violence and sexual assault. (Later that year, the climber was sentenced to life in prison, for three sexual assaults in Yosemite National Park.) Shortly afterward, editorial staffers were called into a meeting with Heather Dietrick, Outside’s new chief media officer, who had formerly worked at Gawker and the Daily Beast. Dietrick cited the story about the climber, saying that although it was praiseworthy it was an example of the kind of content that Outside should consider moving away from. The company’s mission was to inspire people to go outside; dark and depressing investigative reporting did the exact opposite. (A representative wrote that the magazine aims for “a healthy mix of uplifting, adventure-focused stories and thorough investigative journalism.”) Then, last fall, after a writer on assignment was photographed standing with Tim Walz, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, while wearing a Harris/Walz cap, higher-ups pushed for extra layers of oversight for political content in advance of the election. This contributed to a “chilling” effect, former staffers said. Thurston said that there was never any kind of ban on political content, and pointed to Outside’s coverage of staff cuts in national parks as an example, among others. But former staffers told the Columbia Journalism Review that stories perceived as political were “defanged” or significantly delayed. Thurston seemed caught off guard by the negative reaction on social media to the most recent layoffs, which he characterized as part of a necessary shift in strategy. “To me, it’s kind of, like, adapt or die for every media company,” he told me. A representative from the public-relations team working with the company sent me an article from the Times titled “The Gen X Career Meltdown,” the subhead of which read, “Just when they should be at their peak, experienced workers in creative fields find that their skills are all but obsolete.” “I think you have a lot of passionate and somewhat earnest people,” Michael Roberts, an Outside staffer since 2000 and the company’s current director of strategic initiatives, said. “I do think the nostalgia element of this is a big factor.” These days, he argued, maybe the best way to stoke enthusiasm and capture fleeting attention spans isn’t only through a long article but through a live event, a podcast, or a video. “I think about my own kid—like, is he ever going to read a story like that?” But sources familiar with the company’s operations, including former executives, say that the problems at Outside, Inc., can’t just be chalked up to a changing media landscape. Former employees described Thurston as quick to both embrace and abandon ideas, strong on vision but weak on execution. (For the past three years, the company has not had a chief operating officer.) The new ownership migrated the magazine’s website to a new platform. “We lost all our Google cred, and our traffic just tanked,” a person familiar with operations told me. As the new ownership focussed on its digital strategy, print subscriptions declined by more than seventy per cent, the person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission said. “The people there are just trying to hold on to this thing with their fingernails. On a human-to-human level, it makes you sad, because these are people who care about the outdoors and people who care about publishing, and every resource they have is being systematically dismantled,” a current contributor told me. The membership model hasn’t taken off as planned. Outside+ presently has fewer than a million paid subscribers, and a significant number of these have come via the company’s acquisitions rather than through organic growth. “It’s all been organic shrinkage, actually,” the former executive said. “Where I thought we would be four years ago . . .” Thurston said. “The last four years have not been easy.” In 2022, Outside, Inc., announced the Outerverse, which included an N.F.T. marketplace “committed to promoting wellness, diversity, and sustainability with the help of blockchain technology.” Editors and writers were encouraged to produce stories about the blockchain. When a writer at CyclingTips wrote a lightly skeptical take on N.F.T.s, it was quickly taken down. That June, the company celebrated the launch of the Outerverse with a rooftop Jack Johnson concert in New York. But the project was plagued with technical issues, and only a few hundred of the ten thousand N.F.T.s were sold. That fall, FTX collapsed, and the N.F.T. market cratered. The Outerverse quietly shut down. “It was just the wrong moment,” Thurston said. “But it hasn’t stopped us from taking swings at opportunities.” Even before last month’s layoffs, the optimism of the early post-acquisition months had given way to a grim feeling that Outside, Inc., was struggling, and that the legacy of the acquired media brands hung in the balance. Owing in part to the company’s belt-tightening efforts, Thurston sold Outside’s Santa Fe offices. Before its new owners took possession—they are reportedly transforming the building into a boutique hotel—the old guard convened a hasty goodbye party. The atmosphere, at once debauched and sombre, felt like a wake, one attendee said. Partygoers were given permission to clear out most of the remaining furnishings, including framed prints of famous issues and National Magazine Award statuettes. Speaking with former Outside staffers, I got the sense that their anger was, at least to some extent, a cover for dismay at a more diffuse and painful set of losses, as tech and finance have encroached on the Mountain West: the ski resorts bought up by private equity; the dirtbag climbers priced out of small towns; Bozeman, of all places, becoming the next tech hot spot. “It just seemed like, to a lot of us watching from afar, Is this the way people are now? Is this the way they live their life?” Sides said. Right now, the company’s focus is on the Outside Festival, in Denver, later this spring. More than eighteen thousand tickets were sold for last year’s inaugural event, which was pitched as a cross between TED, South by Southwest, and the Consumer Electronics Show. This year’s events will include bands, a climbing wall, gear booths, and a startup-pitch competition. When Thurston spoke about it, his voice brightened. “It’s not just about the magazine,” he said, sounding suddenly full of enthusiasm for the future. “It’s, like, What are all of these different avenues to inspire people to get outdoors?” ♦

The funds raised will be for its airports business, specifically for the upcoming airport at Navi Mumbai, the first phase of which is scheduled to commence operations in June this year, according to indications given by its airport arm. Sources said that the group was confident that a public issuance of bonds would get strong traction from US investors, a view bolstered by a recent $750 million private bond placement by an Adani group offshore promoter entity that was subscribed by leading investors including the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock. In February, the group had raised $200 million through a private bond placement for its port operations in Australia. The group is now looking for a larger fund raise through a public bond issue, and the indications are that it could be some time in the middle of the year. In February, US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order directing the US Department of Justice to stop prosecuting Americans who had been accused of bribing foreign officials to secure business contracts. More recently the Trump administration indicated it was rolling back enforcement of certain kinds of white-collar crimes including bribery charges. These developments have been seen as benefiting the Adani group, which is facing bribery and securities fraud charges there. Last year group founder Gautam Adani and several other executives were charged by US law enforcement bodies with bribing officials in India to get solar power contracts for Adani Green Energy, which at that time was raising funds in the US. Any public issuance targeting US investors would require registering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also probing the group over the alleged securities fraud. The Navi Mumbai International Airport, in which the Adani group has a 74 per cent stake, will commence operations with one terminal handling 20 million passengers annually. It will be ramped up in phases to reach a passenger-handling capacity of 90 million. Published on April 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: The dollar's sell-off raises concerns that investors are losing trust in the U.S.
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-dollar-value-decline-trump-sell-off-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:22:45Z

Watch CBS News April 18, 2025 / 10:22 AM EDT / CBS/AP Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years — a drop that raises concerns investors may be losing confidence in the U.S. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects deeper investment concerns as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. "Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye." The sell-off in the dollar has accompanied turmoil in both the U.S. stock and bond markets, with investors selling off shares and Treasuries amid concerns about the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on corporate growth and investment. The S&P 500 remains 14% lower than its most recent peak in February, placing it in correction territory. "Particularly disturbing is that both U.S. stocks and bonds fall during these periods—a phenomenon common in emerging markets but rare in developed markets and almost never in America," said Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst. "This is an unambiguous signal from traders that trade wars are sharply curtailing the 'exorbitant privilege' the U.S. has enjoyed for the past half-century." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. To be sure, many investors don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. Some experts say the dollar's decline may be due to its overvaluation, rather than any underlying changes in the strength of the U.S. The dollar "has been overvalued for too long," said Eurizon SLJ Capital in a research note. "All over Europe, we have for years been seeing a tsunami of American tourists, because it was cheaper for an American to fly to Europe to ski than to an American resort 2 hours from home ... A correction in the dollar is just and healthy." But even that is concerning enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that "exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a "confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, "It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar's reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. "Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with," says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. "At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. " They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, "If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin." Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren't as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. "The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn't an alternative." Maybe so, but Mr. Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the way he's rolled them out, with numerous halts and delays. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money, experts say. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is "ripping off" America, as Mr. Trump puts it. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Mr. Trump blasted him, saying "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

IBM workers told to come back to the office When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. IBM has reportedly enacted a mass return-to-office policy, mandating US sales staff to work at least three days a week at a client site, flagship office or sales hub. The news comes just days after the company told its US Cloud employees to return to “strategic” locations (company offices) on similar three-day-per-week terms. In the case of IBM’s US Cloud workers, they’ve been given until July 1 to adhere to the new policy. Workers needing to relocate have been cut a little more slack, with until October 1 to find a new home. It’s unclear when the company’s sales staff will need to move by. On the face of it, IBM’s return-to-office policy is on the nicer side for those in favor of remote and hybrid working. Three days has long been the average in a post-pandemic world, however many of IBM’s fellow tech giants, including Amazon, have enacted full-time five-day policies, marking an end to remote working altogether. Across the US, IBM has five flagship offices in New York, Raleigh, Washington DC and San Francisco. The fifth, in Austin, will be open by next year. A further eight sales hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle are also available for in-person work. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! According to an internal memo by Adam Lawrence seen by The Register, Dallas-based Digital Sales workers will be relocated to the new Austin office when it opens in 2026. Lawrence billed the RTO move as a “return to client initiative,” suggesting that sales staff need to be closer to clients to secure sales. Casually referred to as an initialism for ‘I’ve Been Moved’, IBM has a long history of relocating workers, however positions have been relatively stable at the company in the grand scheme of things. Apart from around 1,000 layoffs in August 2024 relating to the closure of a China R&D department, IBM’s only other big job cut was in January 2023, when 3,900 lost their jobs. Only a handful of much smaller reductions have followed since then.

Title: Strange Sell-Off In The Dollar Raises The Specter Of Investors Losing Trust In The US Under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk.

But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar.

Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Title: Watch These AMD Price Levels as Stock Slides Amid New U.S. Rules on Chip Exports to China
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-amd-price-levels-as-stock-slides-amid-new-us-rules-on-chip-exports-to-china-11716978

Full Content:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.

Title: Freshman Rep. Suhas Subramanyam Blasts Data Centers While Cashing In on the Tech Companies That Own Them
URL: https://freebeacon.com/democrats/freshman-rep-suhas-subramanyam-blasts-data-centers-while-cashing-in-on-the-tech-companies-that-own-them/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
He's talking tough on big tech—but banking on their servers. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman Democrat who represents Northern Virginia, is sounding the alarm about the large data centers that have cropped up in his district, blasting them as "invasive" pollutants that could attract cyberattacks. Those centers support more than 78,000 jobs in Northern Virginia. And while Subramanyam doesn't want them in his backyard, he owns hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in the companies that own them, records show. Subramanyam is sitting on at least $630,000 worth of stock in companies like Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, with holdings potentially in excess of $1 million, according to congressional financial disclosures. The companies own or provide critical support to a lion's share of the Virginia data centers, which help power the internet by storing user data for some of America's largest companies. Subramanyam's district is home to more data centers than any other in the country—but during a recent committee hearing, he portrayed them as a creeping menace. "They seemed like a great idea at the time ... but our community is paying the price now, and we're a cautionary tale for the rest of the country," Subramanyam said, calling the centers "not great for the communities." "[In]the next five years alone, data centers can increase customers bills by up to $276 a year, and people's utility bills may double in the next 7 to 10 years just to power data centers," Subramanyam said. "And the environmental impact is real as well. These green spaces are disappearing. Pollution is rising and water supplies are being stretched thin. It's making reaching our clean energy goals in Virginia nearly impossible." "And it's also a security risk," the congressman continued, warning that Russia or other malign actors would be tempted to target the data center hub which had emerged in his district. "You just look at the Ukraine war. When Russia failed to hack Ukraine’s telecom networks, what did they target? They targeted the data centers." A combination of factors—including tax incentives, an abundance of skilled labor, good climate, and proximity to cable internet infrastructure—has made Northern Virginia an ideal spot for the tech sector's data centers. Should they move elsewhere, Subramanyam's stock portfolio would likely rebound—and the area he represents would lose some $31 billion in economic output, according to the Northern Virginia Technology Council. Subramanyam specifically holds at least $500,000 in NVIDIA and at least $130,000 more in Amazon and Meta, according to his most recent personal financial disclosures. Amazon alone maintains at least 93 data centers in Northern Virginia, according to DataCenters.com, a third-party monitoring website. Meta's data center in Sandston, Va., occupies 450,000 square feet and cost $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. And while NVIDIA does not own centers outright, they play an integral role in the data center ecosystem. The company's NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program partners with centers by providing coveted certifications guaranteeing they are optimized to handle the various demands and requirements of their parent companies. Rep. Nick Langworthy (R., N.Y.) sent a message to the companies operating data centers in Subramanyam's district. "We need to focus on keeping America competitive and powering our future," he told the Washington Free Beacon. "If Rep. Subramanyam is too foolish to want these great jobs in his district, bring them to mine!" Subramanyam did not respond to a request for comment.

Military experts highlight Panamaâs vulnerability to port blockades disrupting global trade. US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. President Donald Trump's recent congressional address has thrust the Panama Canal into the spotlight of a new geopolitical contest. Trump highlighted BlackRock's proposed $22 billion acquisition of ports at either end of the Panama Canalâcurrently owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchisonâcalling attention to the strategic risks of foreign control over vital infrastructure. The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt Nikita Casap sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, discussing relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. The Wisconsin teen accused of killing his parents to obtain financial means to assassinate President Trump and overthrow the United States government was allegedly working with foreign entities, including someone with a Ukrainian phone number and someone in Russia, according to an FBI affidavit. He also asked his contact who would be blamed for the attack, and was told "Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal." Nikita Casap, 17, of Wisconsin, allegedly sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, who writes in Cyrillic, discussing going into "hiding" before relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison. Additionally, to avoid detection, the instructions advise to not bring a cell phone." In a Telegram chat from January 21, 2025, it was revealed that the goal of the operation was to blame Russia for the assasination. ...more TOPICS: KEYWORDS: assassinationplot; heroofzeeperland; nikitacasap; trump; ukraine; zeeperhero Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-34 next last 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: bitt Wow, what a genius. 2 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:31 PM PDT by yldstrk (Nothing like the truth) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: bitt What was his Reddit/Bluesky handle? 3 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:44 PM PDT by RushIsMyTeddyBear ("Uncle Sugar" is being audited and having an enema.)

Realty firm Prestige Estates Projects Ltd sales bookings rose 48 per cent to nearly Rs 7,000 crore in January-March quarter, but pre-sales declined 19 per cent to over Rs 17,000 crore in the last fiscal. Prestige Estates attributed the fall in annual sales bookings numbers to lower launches of housing projects due to a lack of approvals from development authorities. As a result, the company has failed to achieve the annual sales bookings guidance of Rs 24,000 crore. In a regulatory filing, Bengaluru-based Prestige Estates shared its operational performance for the fourth quarter of the last fiscal and the full 2024-25 financial year. The company’s sales bookings stood at Rs 6,957.4 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal, an increase of 48 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y). Sales volume stood at 4.49 million square feet, a 9 per cent increase Y-o-Y. Total units sold during the fourth quarter stood at 2,301. The average realisation for apartments, villas, and commercial properties was Rs 15,524 per square foot, representing a 25 per cent Y-o-Y increase. For plotted developments, the average realisation rose to Rs 6,975 per square feet, a 27 per cent increase from the same quarter last year. Prestige Estates said the sales bookings during the 2024-25 fiscal declined 19 per cent to Rs 17,023.1 crore, “reflecting the impact of deferred launches amid approval delays”. Sales volume for 2024-25 stood at 12.58 million square feet, down 38 per cent Y-o-Y. Total units sold across FY25 stood at 5,919. The average realisation for apartments, villas, and commercial products rose to Rs 14,113 per square feet, an impressive 36 per cent increase Y-o-Y. Plot sale realisation increased to Rs 7,167 per square foot, registering a 50 per cent Y-o-Y growth. Irfan Razack, Chairman and Managing Director of Prestige Group, said, “FY25 brought with it a mix of achievements and challenges.

Title: 2024 Top 100: Growing Pains Hamper The Estée Lauder Cos.

From an about-face on Amazon to a reset C-suite, the company was largely flat year-over-year. Senior Editor, Beauty With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Other changes included Tracey T. Travis stepping down as CFO, replaced by Akhil Shrivastava. The changes continued into 2025 under de La Faverie’s leadership, with Peter Jueptner, Estée Lauder group president, international, leaving, followed by a plethora of moves to its international leadership. Related Articles Fragrance EXCLUSIVE: Kering Beauté Names New CEO at Creed Skin Care EXCLUSIVE: Estée Lauder Focuses on Beauty Rest With Appointment of First Global Sleep Adviser, Dr. Matthew Walker On the brand level, Jane Hertzmark Hudis will take on the new title of executive vice president, chief brand officer, reporting directly to de La Faverie. The company’s 24 brands will now be organized by category clusters reporting to Hudis, with the hope being that this will break down silos and accelerate speed-to-market innovations. Much of the leadership reshuffling involves the elevation of internal executives, many of whom had joined the company in the last few years. Last June, Frédéric Malle announced plans to leave his eponymous niche fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. As for the board, Ronald S. Lauder, a son of founder Estée, retired and handed one of his seats to his son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer, who is married to Aerin Lauder. Most recently, the company expanded the number of layoffs it needs to make from the 3,000 announced in 2024 to as many as 7,000 as part of its Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. It was also reported that Lauder had hired consultancy Evercore to assess its current brand portfolio, with continued speculation that it could look at divestments. Throughout 2024, weak demand in China and Asia travel retail continued to weigh on Lauder, while cracks started to appear in its home market. As a result, the company pulled its full year 2025 outlook in October due to continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As of press time, it had not issued a new one. While analysts believe some impactive factors are out of Lauder’s control, de La Faverie is betting on his Beauty Reimagined strategy to “restore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years,” he said in a release. Key to his vision is expanding into high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to participate in key growth opportunities in prestige beauty. Over the last nine months, for example, key brands like Estée Lauder, Clinique and The Ordinary have launched on Amazon, while in Europe, the company is eager to leverage the strength of its skin care category in the pharmacy channel, for one. Per the company, the move to Amazon appears to have been so far successful. As for launches, Balmain debuted Les Éternels de Balmain, a collection of eight fragrances, produced under license by the Estée Lauder Cos. Deciem, the incubator and parent company of The Ordinary — which closed its $1.7 billion deal with parent The Estée Lauder Cos. in 2024 — debuted Loopha, a body care brand with two products, hand and body washes. Other key launches included La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty’s Runway Lip Color, with the help of its first ever celebrity face, Angelina Jolie. Also during 2024, Clinique made a philanthropic commitment of $5 million over seven years to establish the Mount Sinai-Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Centre with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. It will study skin aging, skin allergies and inflammatory eczematous skin conditions. Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Title: The 2024 Top 100 Beauty Companies
URL: http://wwd.com/lists/top-beauty-companies-in-the-world-2024-1237087322/

WWD Beauty Inc's annual ranking of the world's largest beauty companies by sales. Speed and agility were the buzzwords of 2024, so it’s apropos that beauty sales broke the $250 billion barrier for the first time last year. But there are clouds on the horizon. What’s clear from the 2024 WWD Beauty Inc Top 100, our annual ranking of the world’s largest beauty companies by sales, is that the industry is undergoing seismic shifts as a result of geopolitical tensions, technological advances and a consumer landscape that is more complex than ever before. The good news is that total sales hit $252.09 billion. But that represented an increase of just 2.8 percent year-over-year, almost half that of 2023’s 5.3 percent gain. The ongoing slowdown in China weighed heavily on sales, and corporate restructuring was in the cards for a number of players as they sought to derisk and home in on high-potential categories. L’Oréal accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales, its share of the Top 100 inching up once more, by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, up from 14.7 percent in 2019. The top 10 companies overall generated sales of $147.49 billion, or 58.5 percent of total Top 100 revenues, down 0.9 percentage points. Despite the year’s challenges, the vast majority — 73 percent — of companies saw their sales increase, but only 29 saw double-digit gains, down from 37 a year earlier, a sign of slower growth on the market overall. Of the 17 players with negative sales progression, seven were down more than 10 percent and three posted declines of more than 20 percent. Among the biggest winners: Spain’s Puig entered the top 10 for the first time, up four places on a year ago, driven by strong growth in fragrance and skin care. L’Occitane, buoyed by the year’s viral hit Sol de Janeiro, climbed two places to number 18. While times were tough for a number of C-beauty players, the biggest Chinese company on the list, Proya, jumped eight spots to number 28, the first C-beauty firm to reach the Top 30 global beauty companies. With social-savvy affordable makeup players still trending as consumers feel the pinch, despite weakness in mass overall, especially in the U.S., beauty got two new billionaire brands, with E.l.f Beauty and Cosnova both surpassing that milestone in dollar terms. This year’s newcomers include D&G Beauty, which has seen its sales explode since it took its beauty license, previously held by Shiseido, back in-house; Chinese makeup artist brand Mao Geping, which went public in Hong Kong; Auréa Group, the new owner seeking to turn around The Body Shop; Shein, which is flying high with in-house brand Sheglam, and AS Beauty, which bought Bliss World from L Catterton and has successfully rejuvenated the Laura Geller makeup brand. But it was a rough ride for beauty on the stock market in 2024. Of the 49 listed players tracked in our By the Numbers section, only 15 saw their share prices increase through the year, with Victoria’s Secret & Co. the biggest gainer as the market reacted to its turnaround efforts. Of the 29 public players whose share value fell, 21 were down in the double digits, and five of the biggest decliners — Nu Skin Enterprises, Yunnan Botanee, Olaplex, The Estée Lauder Cos. and Shiseido — were already on the wane a year ago, with their market value falling further in 2024. The WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranks the world’s largest beauty manufacturers. Firms are arranged by their beauty sales for the 2024 calendar year. For those companies whose fiscal year did not run from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, estimates were calculated. All sales figures were either obtained from the companies or generated with the help of industry sources, indicated by (EST.) in the ranking. For this list, “beauty” includes fragrance, makeup, skin care, body care, sun care, hair care, deodorant, plus cellulite and shaving products. It does not include bar soaps, razors, toothpastes, food and diet foods, medicines, vitamins, detergents or appliances. The revenues only include sales of beauty products each firm owns or manufactures and do not include business from private-label lines produced for other brands or products distributed for other companies. Information in the main brands section reflects company holdings in 2024. Year-over-year percentage changes are in reported terms, not on a like-for- like or constant-currency basis, unless specified. Non-U.S.-based firms’ sales are converted into dollars according to the 2024 average yearly exchange rate.* Sales figures in non-U.S. currencies were converted to the dollar using the following 2024 average exchange rates from Oanda.com: €1=$1.08190 ¥1=$0.00660898£1=$1.277951 KRW=$0.000733035 R$1=$0.186202CNY 1=$0.1390721 Rupee=$0.0119508 SFr=$1.136091 HK$=$0.1281551 Mexican peso=$0.0548935 Clichy, France2024 Beauty Sales:$47.04 Billion€43.48 Billion+5.6% VS. 2023 Despite continuing to outperform the market as a whole, beauty’s biggest player was not immune to the market’s challenges in 2024. The company described the year as “a tale of two halves,” with a strong first six months followed by weakness in the latter part of the year due to the global slowdown and ongoing challenges in China. Had it not been for the North Asia region, its sales would have advanced in the high single digits, it said. London2024 Beauty Sales:$26.63 Billion (EST.)€24.61 Billion (EST.)+1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) The upheaval at Unilever continues. 2024 was a year dedicated to slimming down and streamlining its operating structure under CEO Hein Schumacher, who joined the company in July 2023 and implemented a major reset in October that year. The news this February that Schumacher would step down in March by mutual agreement took the market by surprise, particularly as he had been praised for his strategy, which the company has said is beginning to bear fruit. CFO Fernando Fernandez — Unilever’s head of Beauty & Wellbeing until 2023 — was named CEO. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$15.2 Billion (EST.)FLAT VS. 2023 With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Cincinnati2024 Beauty Sales:$15 Billion (EST.)FLAT VS. 2023 (EST.) Continued economic and geo-political headwinds, particularly in China, weighed on results for Procter & Gamble’s beauty activity last year. On an organic basis, the firm’s beauty business delivered sales growth of 2%, with slight gains across most brands and geographies. Paris2024 Beauty Sales:$9.11 Billion (EST.)€8.42 Billion (EST.)+2% VS. 2023 LVMH attributed its slight growth in beauty once again to a combination of innovation and its selective retail strategy. As with its competitors, the ongoing slowdown in China appears to have weighed on growth, with Asia (outside Japan) shrinking its weight in the company’s beauty business for the fifth year in a row, down to 30% last year, compared with 33% a year earlier and as much as 45% in 2020. London2024 Beauty Sales:$8.54 Billion (EST.)€7.89 Billion (EST.)+2.6% VS. 2023 With its fragrance business flat, Chanel’s other beauty axes drove business, with makeup the main contributor to its slight uptick in estimated beauty revenues. Sales grew in all markets except the U.S., and Chanel’s performance in travel retail was solid, recovering in most regions but remaining slightly below 2019 levels in North Asia. Hamburg, Germany2024 Beauty Sales:$8.53 Billion (EST.)€7.88 Billion (EST.)+4.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another strong year for the skin care specialist, which CEO Vincent Warnery said was “the best performing skin care company globally” for the second year in a row. Bolstered by strong business from Nivea and the ongoing growth of its Derma brands, especially Eucerin, the German company was on a roll. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$6.55 Billion (EST.)¥990.59 Billion (EST.)+1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) While Shiseido’s sales were relatively stable in 2024, boosted by an uptick on the domestic market, its operating profit tanked, falling 73.1% with the continuing deceleration in China and duty-free weighing heavily on its results. Amsterdam2024 Beauty Sales:$6.1 Billion (EST.)+1.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The fragrance effect was alive and well at Coty in 2024, although its most recent set of earnings showed this was not enough to offset pressures from weak demand in Asia and tight inventory in the U.S. in the latter part of the calendar year, weighing on numbers. Barcelona2024 Beauty Sales:$4.79 Billion (EST.)€4.43 Billion (EST.)+12% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was a big year for Spain’s Puig as it made its stock market debut, further bolstered its portfolio and celebrated its 110th anniversary and listing with a new visual identity. The company outperformed both the premium beauty market and its own midterm revenue guidance for the year, and growth was weighted strongly in the second half. Addison, TX2024 Beauty Sales:$4.6 Billion (EST.)+7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The world’s number-one direct seller of skin care and makeup, per Euromonitor data, Mary Kay broadened its reach to a younger audience with the launch of Mary Kay Skin Care, formulated for those not ready for age-defying products, composed of two regimens, Hydrating and Mattifying. Columbus, Ohio2024 Beauty Sales:$4.58 Billion (EST.)+0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Bath & Body Works spent 2024 building momentum. It maintained market leadership and unit market share in the U.S. body care, home fragrance and soaps and sanitizers segments in 2024, and continued to drive growth in adjacent areas like men’s, laundry, lip and hair care. São Paulo2024 Beauty Sales:$4.49 Billion (EST.)R$24.09 Billion (EST.)-24.4% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another complex year for the Brazilian beauty heavyweight. Following the sale of Aēsop to L’Oréal and the divestment of The Body Shop in 2023 as it sought to simplify its operations and reduce debt, Natura announced early in 2024 that it was looking at options to spin off Avon, whose operations it had acquired outside North America (that activity is owned by South Korea’s LG H&H) in 2020. Düsseldorf2024 Beauty Sales:$4.24 Billion (EST.)€3.92 Billion (EST.)+3.9% VS. 2023 (EST.) Henkel continued to rationalize its portfolio and boost the momentum behind its biggest brands and categories through 2024. It said the strategy, which has seen the company shed businesses in its Consumer Brands portfolio representing around €1 billion in revenues since 2022, is beginning to bear fruit, notably in the hair care category, where the rationalization is more advanced than in other segments. In beauty, following the 2023 disposal of skin care brand Diadermine, it quietly sold off natural skin care label N.A.E. to Katjes International last year. Skillman, N.J.2024 Beauty Sales:$4.2 Billion (EST.)-3% VS. 2023 (EST.) As Kenvue finds its footing out from under Johnson & Johnson and onto the public market, its skin care activity felt the impact of the declining mass market in the U.S. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$4.14 Billion (EST.)¥625.7 Billion (EST.)+5.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) As it sought to seize opportunities outside Asia and dynamize key brands, 2024 was a year of change for Kao as it continued to implement its “Global Sharp Top” strategy introduced in 2023. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$3.6 Billion (EST.)-2.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) Sales slowed for Colgate-Palmolive’s beauty activity last year, according to estimates. The company said it saw organic sales growth in liquid hand soaps and body wash, but declines in its skin health business, as well as for deodorants in North America. Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland2024 Beauty Sales:$3.14 Billion (EST.)€2.9 Billion (EST.)+18.9% VS. 2023 (EST.) L’Occitane’s Sol de Janeiro brand was one of beauty’s biggest newsmakers of the year with its explosive growth across geographies as young consumers flocked toward its affordable body sprays and core body care offering. Seoul2024 Beauty Sales:$3.02 Billion (EST.)KRW 4.12 Trillion (EST.)+6.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Amorepacific’s turnaround efforts began to bear fruit last year, helped especially by strong growth outside Asia. Its revenues in the Americas surpassed those in Greater China for the first time in the group’s history. The integration of sensitive skin care brand Cosrx starting in the second quarter contributed to growth, especially in the EMEA region. Laneige, Hera, Aestura, Illiyoon and Labo-H also performed well, with strong sales in multibrand retail and online. Seoul2024 Beauty Sales:$2.9 Billion (EST.)KRW 3.95 Trillion (EST.)+0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Despite ongoing tough conditions in China, travel retail and the domestic market, LG H&H returned to slight growth with its beauty activity in 2024. The company has been restructuring its operations to focus on agility and brand building and fostering closer collaboration between its domestic and international operations.

The biggest recent news for Wella Co. was the announcement this January that its CEO, Annie Young-Scrivner, was stepping down. Board chair Glenn K. Murphy was appointed to oversee the company as executive chair. Young-Scrivner, who is understood to have resigned for personal reasons, helmed the company for four years, taking on the role at the newly formed company when Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts acquired a 60% stake in it from Coty Inc. She helped Wella navigate the pandemic and oversaw the acquisition of Briogeo. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$2.13 Billion (EST.)¥322.76 Billion (EST.)+7.4% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Neuilly-sur-Seine, France2024 Beauty Sales:$2.06 Billion (EST.)€1.9 Billion (EST.)+2.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) Strong growth in the U.S. and in mainland China, where Groupe Clarins’ sales gained 16% and 8% respectively in 2024, were the biggest drivers for the family-owned firm, which outperformed the market in both countries. It also did well in the U.K. and Italy. Makeup continued to be a source of growth, with key launches including Lip Oil Balm. Once again, the firm’s direct-to-consumer business outperformed sales to third-party sellers, which were up 3% like-for-like. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$2 Billion (EST.)-3% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Through Thursday's close, Netflix shares have gained 9% since the start of the year and trade nearly 60% higher over the past 12 months as the company continues to grow its advertising sales and live events content. Analysts have also touted Netflix’s ability to withstand an economic downturn amid uncertainty related to tariffs, with JPMorgan describing it as the “most resilient” company it tracks. Netflix has also attracted attention for its attempt to double its revenue and achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, which the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Below, we take a closer look at Netflix’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching. After setting their record high in February, Netflix shares retraced as much as 23% before bulls stepped in to support the stock last week near the 50-week moving average. It’s worth noting that the rebound coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving higher from the 50 threshold, a reading that has marked the bottom of several prior pullbacks in the stock since early 2023. More recently, the shares continued to gain momentum leading into the streamer’s quarterly results, with the price set to open around the psychological $1,000 level on Monday morning. (U.S. markets are closed Friday in commemoration of Good Friday.) Let’s identify two key overhead areas on Netflix’s chart that investors may be watching and also point out important support levels to monitor during retracements. Netflix shares rose 3.5% to around $1,007 in after-hours trading Thursday. The first overhead area to keep tabs on sits at $1,065. Investors who bought shares during the pullback could decide to place sell orders near the stock’s all-time high (ATH). We can project an upside target to watch above the ATH by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the tool to Netflix’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the stock’s trend higher from August to December last year and overlay them from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $1,300, about 34% above Thursday’s closing price. The earlier trend played out over 17 weeks before the stock consolidated, indicating a similar trending move may last until early August if price action rhymes. During retracements, investors should keep track of the $821 level. A retest of this area could see investors seek entry points near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with the end of a five-week losing streak in early January. Finally, selling below this level sets the stage for a possible fall to around $697. Netflix shares could encounter support in this region near last year’s prominent July swing high and a period of sideways drift on the chart between mid-August and late September.

Theories: I don’t actually think it’s pressure from AI from China or whatever,,, rather, kind of a sea change. Corporation that just has its life blood and advertising, in today’s brave New World I don’t think we’ll be profitable. Unless Google basics and bitcoin somewhere, the future of Google is bleak. assuming that there’s no turning back the clocks of time, that the tariffs against China will be semi permanent, then the big issue: Less advertising revenue because your people will be promoting their products because once again, all the production is made in China. Key Points Reasons for the Stock Decline Google’s stock, under Alphabet Inc., has seen a significant drop due to several interconnected factors. Here’s a breakdown for clarity: These factors have collectively eroded investor confidence, though Alphabet’s long-term position in tech remains robust. Detailed Analysis and Survey Note Google’s stock, represented by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), has experienced a notable decline, reflecting a complex interplay of financial, legal, and market dynamics as of April 17, 2025. This analysis synthesizes information from multiple reputable sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving this downturn, offering insights for investors and stakeholders. Financial Performance and Investor Reactions Alphabet’s recent financial performance has been a significant contributor to the stock’s decline. The company’s Q4 earnings, released earlier this year, reported sales of $96.5 billion, falling short of the consensus estimate of $96.6 billion, despite earnings per share of $2.15 exceeding expectations of $2.13 Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. This revenue miss, coupled with weaker-than-expected cloud growth at 30% year-over-year compared to analyst forecasts, led to a 7% stock plunge post-announcement. The cloud segment, a critical growth area, underperformed, raising concerns among investors about Alphabet’s ability to meet growth targets Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Further exacerbating investor unease is Alphabet’s aggressive capital expenditure plan. The company announced a $75 billion investment for the year, $15 billion more than Wall Street anticipated, with a significant portion allocated to AI infrastructure expansion. This high spending, while aimed at meeting demand, has raised questions about the return on investment (ROI), especially as analysts like UBS lowered their price target from $211 to $191, and JPMorgan adjusted theirs from $232 to $220, suggesting investors may need to wait for AI initiatives to pay off Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Bank of America, however, maintained a “buy” rating with a $225 target, suggesting potential benefits from AI overviews for search monetization in 2025, indicating a split in analyst sentiment. Legal and Regulatory Challenges Legal challenges have added significant pressure on Alphabet’s stock. On a recent Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google created a monopoly controlling parts of the online-advertising industry, marking the second time in eight months the company has been labeled an illegal monopolist Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly. This ruling could lead to the Justice Department seeking forced sales of some of Google’s advertising products, a move that could disrupt its core revenue streams. Additionally, ongoing antitrust cases, including allegations of monopolizing general search services, have contributed to a lower valuation multiple compared to peers like Amazon (38x forward earnings) and Microsoft (32x forward earnings) Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. These legal overhangs have weighed heavily on investor sentiment, with proposals like selling key assets such as Chrome and potentially Android further fueling uncertainty Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly. Competitive Landscape and Market Dynamics Competition from emerging players, particularly in the AI space, has also impacted Alphabet’s stock. A notable example is DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup claiming to develop a rival AI model at a fraction of the cost, raising concerns about the efficiency and competitiveness of American firms’ AI spending Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. This competition, combined with Meta’s perceived clearer ROI path through advertising with its $60-65 billion investment, has led to unfavorable comparisons for Alphabet, further pressuring its stock Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Broader market dynamics have also played a role. Alphabet has been caught in a tech sell-off, losing over $500 billion in market cap, dropping its valuation from over $2.5 trillion to $2 trillion in recent weeks Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap. The Nasdaq Composite, tech-heavy and indicative of sector trends, entered a correction with a nearly 13% decline over 13 trading sessions, reflecting investor unease over factors like Trump’s tariffs and AI spending Yahoo Finance: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Latest Stock News & Headlines. Despite these challenges, some analysts see Alphabet as undervalued at current prices, with a valuation estimate of $200 per share based on 22x expected 2025 earnings of $9.07, compared to its historical average P/E of 18x Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. Investor Sentiment and Long-Term Outlook The combination of these factors has created significant investor uncertainty, with the stock experiencing its largest single-day decline in value, erasing up to $211 billion in market value on February 5, 2025, following the earnings report Times of India: Google loses $200 billion-plus in market value; biggest-ever single-day decline. Despite this, some analysts argue that Alphabet remains a solid buy, given its better finances compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks, though caution is advised due to the ongoing challenges Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap. In summary, the decline in Google’s stock is driven by a mix of internal financial decisions, legal battles, competitive pressures, and external market conditions. While short-term volatility is evident, Alphabet’s long-term prospects in the tech industry, particularly in AI and cloud computing, remain strong, though investors are currently focused on navigating the uncertainties outlined above.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Visits Beijing Amid Tightened Chip Export Control

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is walking a delicate line. Like other major tech companies, the chip giant is currying favor with the Trump administration by making massive investments in U.S. infrastructure. At the same time, Nvidia is trying to preserve its lucrative ties to international markets like China, as evidenced by Huang’s latest visit to Beijing. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A day after Nvidia said it will take a $5.5 billion quarterly hit from new U.S. export license requirements affecting its H20 GPU—designed specifically for the Chinese market—Huang arrived in Beijing today (April 17) to meet with local official and tech leaders, including DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang. During a meeting with Hongbin Ren, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which invited Huang, the Nvidia CEO expressed hopes for continued cooperation with Beijing and emphasized the importance of China to Nvidia’s business, according to local media reports. The visit comes at a particularly tense moment in U.S.-China relations, as both countries remain locked in an escalating trade war. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump enacted 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with a 125 percent levy on American goods. The Trump administration also recently announced new curbs that will require export licenses for semiconductors shipped to China. In an SEC filing this week, Nvidia said the license requirement would cost the company $5.5 billion in additional charges, which will be reflected in its first-quarter earnings report on May 28. In response to earlier restrictions under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, which prohibited the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, Nvidia developed the H20 chip to comply with the new rules. Last year, China accounted for approximately 13 percent of Nvidia’s global revenue. The news license requirement will also affect AMD’s MI308 chips and could cost the company up to $800 million. On April 14, Nvidia pledged to invest up to $500 billion over the next four decades to produce chips in the U.S. The Trump administration hailed the announcement as evidence of “the Trump effect in action,” aligning with the President’s agenda to strengthen domestic manufacturing. Other tech giants like OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) have also made similar investments in recent weeks. Huang’s pledge doesn’t mean he has quite given up on China. In addition to his meeting with Ren, he reportedly met with Lifeng He, China’s vice premier for economic policy, who reiterated the country’s openness to foreign investment and trade partnerships. Huang also met with DeepSeek’s Wenfeng Liang to discuss next-generation chip designs that meet U.S. regulatory standards, according to the Financial Times. DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley earlier this year by unveiling a pair of A.I. models that rivaled the performance of leading U.S. systems—despite being developed at a fraction of the cost. The surprise launch prompted renewed calls from American tech leaders for stricter export controls to slow China’s momentum in A.I.

April 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Merck on February 12, 2025 with a Class Period from February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Merck have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

Mumbai: Ahmedabad-headquartered Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said Thursday that it will buy a port terminal in Australia’s Queensland from a promoter company in a non-cash deal that values the 50-million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) capacity asset at an enterprise value of A$3,975 million (approximately ₹21,640 crore or $2.5 billion). The Adanis’ flagship port company will issue 143.8 million equity shares to Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (CRPSHPL). CRPSHPL is a promoter-owned entity that ultimately owns the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT). The transaction will see promoter shareholding in APSEZ go up by 2.13 percentage points to 68.02%. APSEZ had first purchased the port terminal in 2011 for about ₹9,000 crore, as per news reports. However, the asset was sold to the Adani family in 2013 to manage the debt of the listed company. Also read | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds “NQXT’s acquisition is a pivotal step in our international strategy, opening new export markets and securing long-term contracts with valued users,” Ashwani Gupta, whole-time director & CEO, APSEZ, said in a press statement. The terminal is strategically located on the East-West trade corridor, he said. The company is aiming to grow the Ebitda from the asset to A$400 million (about $255 million) in four years, Gupta further said. It recorded an Ebitda of A$ 228 million in FY25. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The terminal has a rated capacity of 50 MTPA and the company estimates that the capacity can be ramped up to 120 MTPA as demand grows. In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the terminal handled 35 million metric tonnes of cargo, the company said. As part of the transaction, APSEZ will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities associated with the terminal. However, APSEZ’s leverage will remain at similar levels post the transaction, the company said. Read this | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever NQXT is a natural deep-water, multi-user export terminal at the Port of Abbot Point, approximately 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government till the year 2110. The terminal has a “high quality customer base” operating in the Bowen and Galilee mining basins. These mining companies export metallurgical and energy coal to over 15 countries from NQXT. APSEZ is India’s largest commercial ports operator, and accounts for almost one-fourth of the cargo movement in the country. The expansion is part of APSEZ’s stated goal of handling 1 billion tonnes per annum capacity by 2030. It handled 450 million tonnes in FY25, as per an investor presentation. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹26,711 crore in FY24, and net profit of ₹8,104 crore, per data from the BSE. The company's shares closed 2.2% higher at ₹1,259.90 on the BSE on Thursday.

Title: ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman Derisks, Says Stock Market Volatility Will Be Here for a While

Steve Eisman says he’s taking a wait-and-see approach to the stock market right now. In a new interview with CNBC, the famous investor notes he’s dialed down the risk in his personal portfolio. “I’m waiting. I think we’re going to have volatility for quite a while. The Trump Administration has set up a situation where they’re going to be negotiating with multiple countries on multiple issues. It’s not going to take a couple of weeks, it’s going to take a few months, so I think, for the time being, volatility’s going to be here for a while.” Eisman, who’s known primarily for betting against the housing market prior to the American subprime mortgage crisis, says stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apollo Global Management (APO) have “strong long-term fundamentals” and are primed to make investors money over multi-year timeframes, though he’s less certain about the shorter term. “I would not even hazard a guess as to what any stock will do over the next few months, simply because we’re in the type of market where… there’s only one variable that matters, and right now the variable that matters is the president of the United States, and I can’t handicap that right now.” In terms of NVIDIA specifically, the famed investor says it’s only “the early innings of the AI revolution,” and he predicts the tech giant still has room to grow.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump
URL: https://www.clickondetroit.com/business/2025/04/17/strange-sell-off-in-the-dollar-raises-the-specter-of-investors-losing-trust-in-the-us-under-trump/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T23:25:05Z
Full Content:
Bernard Condon Associated Press Published: April 17, 2025 at 7:25 PM Updated: April 18, 2025 at 3:26 PM Bernard Condon Associated Press NEW YORK – Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. Recommended Videos The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost."

Title: The rise and wobble of India's EV pioneer Ola
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15vgegl7pjo
Time Published: 2025-04-17T21:49:07Z
Full Content:
It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises. Founded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way. The company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn. Marquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (£567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. But this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm. Ola Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny. Sales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride. There's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled. The BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them. Ola has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed. The BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries. So, what's gone wrong? Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market. He poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings. But Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. Its scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. Several former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. In response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the "myth" that the vehicle had "not been engineered and tested for India". It said it had "fully re-engineered" Etergo's scooter and tested it for "Indian conditions". "The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests," it said in the post. But several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions. Some scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. Ola recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires. Some riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. In early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. The front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use. Meanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company. Their entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. Ola aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries. Government data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year. But competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital. To push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago. Besides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale. When angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days. At one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year. But since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to. Late last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a "robust mechanism to address complaints", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved. Aggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause. A majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles. On 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities. The sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous. Ola has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing. It benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties. Critics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines. "Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build," said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV. Some top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. Experts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.

Netflix had its best quarter ever, according to earnings results announced Thursday afternoon, setting the stakes for Netflix stock moving forward after it emerged as a perhaps surprising stock market safe haven during the recent slump. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends a Netflix premiere in February. In its Q1 report released shortly after 4 p.m. EDT market close, Netflix reported its best-ever quarterly earnings per share and revenue numbers. Netflix scored $6.61 EPS ($2.9 billion net income) and $10.54 billion last quarter, besting consensus analyst estimates calling for the entertainment titan to report $5.67 adjusted EPS ($2.5 billion net income) and $10.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet data. The company said it expects $11 billion in sales and $7.03 EPS during the second quarter, topping top and bottom line forecasts of $10.9 billion and $6.25, respectively. Shares of Netflix rose 1.2% to $973 on Thursday, surging another 3% in after-hours trading to nearly $1,000 per share. Netflix has emerged from the 2025 stock losses stronger, gaining 4% since April 2 and 9% year-to-date. That came as the S&P 500 (down 6% since April 2, 10% year-to-date excluding dividends) and the Nasdaq (-7%, -15%) both pulled back as President Donald Trump’s trade war heightened recession concerns. Many analysts herald Netflix stock as a safe parking spot as economic slowdown fears swirl. “If a recession hits, we would expect Netflix subscribers to be sticky as Netflix is a stay-at-home cheap diversion, of the type that has held up well in past recessions,” Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a Monday note to clients. “Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors,” Bank of America analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich concurred in a Tuesday note. Netflix has far outperformed other members of the “FAANG” group, smashing returns this year from the other high-growth technology names: Facebook parent Meta (down 14% year-to-date excluding dividends), Amazon (-21%), Apple (-21%) and Google parent Alphabet (-19%). Netflix has also outperformed Disney (-23% year-to-date) and Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery (-23%), though audio streamer Spotify’s 29% gain this year tops Netflix’s. Fellow FAANG constituents Alphabet and Amazon will join Netflix in reporting Q1 earnings next week. Both West Coast titans will deliver results next Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Nvidia has lost $250 billion worth of market cap in almost an instant
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-h20-chips-jensen-huang-trump-1851776659
Time Published: 2025-04-17T19:10:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to fall after the company reported that it would take a $5.5 billion hit due to export controls implemented by the Trump administration. After Thursday’s stock drop, Nvidia has lost more than $250 billion in market cap value since Tuesday. The chipmaker’s stock fell by as much as 4% on Thursday after plunging 7% the day before. Nvidia remains the third-largest U.S. company by market cap. On Tuesday night, the company announced the $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China, citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The chips were developed to comply with Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China. Jefferies (JEF) analysts said in a Wednesday note that the H20 ban was expected — but that the size of it wasn’t. On Thursday, Stifel (SF) analysts said they maintain confidence in Nvidia’s long-term growth, even amid these Trump-imposed restrictions. While short-term volatility is a possibility, the analysts said the company’s overall growth trajectory is strong and reliable. Analysts for the investment banking company added that the situation underscores the current global trade war policies and the effect they have on the tech industry. Dutch semiconductor company ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales slightly below forecasts and flagged the “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions, warning that new tariffs and restrictions could weigh on its outlook for this year — and next. Stifel analysts noted that Nvidia’s decision to take such a large charge indicates a possible lack of confidence that the necessary export licenses will be granted by the current presidential administration or that no further regulations will be imposed. Still, analysts upheld their “buy” rating and a price target of $180.00 for the company. According to InvestingPro data, Nvidia maintains a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating exceptional financial strength. Meanwhile, the New York Times (NYT) reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went to Beijing to meet with Chinese trade officials. According to state media, Huang emphasized his company’s commitment to the foreign market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” But there could be trouble for Huang back home: The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s business in Asia, focusing on whether the company violated export rules, particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Wedbush Securities said in a note Thursday morning that the chip ban was the “first shots fired” in a potential trade war and said that Nvidia and other U.S. tech companies are “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The fact had somehow escaped me until an email responding to Wednesday’s column about Emily Dickinson. And I’m not sure if I wasn’t better off without the information. But as I now know, for good or bad, most if not all of Dickinson’s poems can be sung to the tune of a traditional American ballad, The Yellow Rose of Texas. For this, I’m indebted to reader Seán Lyons, who tells me he first learned it from a lecture by an American professor at Listowel Writers’ Week a few years back. A long-time admirer of Dickinson, Lyons now sees her in a completely different light: “I cannot read her poems since without mentally donning a 10-gallon hat, and heading towards the sunset, just my rifle, my pony, and me.” Sure enough, I too have suddenly taken to humming “Hope is the thing with feathers–/That perches in the soul”, in a jaunty, thigh-slapping, hoedown rhythm. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,/And Mourners to and fro” has also acquired a whole new personality. But it’s not just The Yellow Rose of Texas, apparently. There are many other songs you can sing Dickinson’s poems to just as well. That’s in part because she wrote in ballad (or hymnal) meter. It may also be an effect of her famous dashes, which break up the lines in a way that Ronnie Drew might have done, to pause for beneath. Whatever the reason, it makes my image of her sharing a bench on the Royal Canal with Brendan Behan seem even more plausible. I don’t know if The Yellow Rose of Texas was one of Behan’s party pieces, but in his memoir Hold Your Hour and Have Another, he mentions someone else singing it in his presence during a pub session in Co Down once. Yellow was not an apt colour that day. It was the Twelfth of July, in the overwhelmingly unionist village of Millisle. Despite being a red-roaring republican, the mischievous Behan was disappointed the old man singing did not choose “something more Orange”. Discussing Euler’s Identity, “the most beautiful equation in maths”, in Thursday’s Irish Times, Peter Lynch was nevertheless mystified as to why a recent visitor to the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove wrote the formula into the visitors’ book. I don’t know either, but perhaps the tower’s circularity inspired thoughts of Pi, one of the numbers used in the equation? Or maybe the visitor was responding to what he saw as the beauty of Joyce’s maths, especially in the construction of Finnegans Wake. I’m thinking of a study by physicists in Poland some years ago, which analysed sentence-length and other patterns in 100 works of literature. FW was the standout result. The study found that its structures mimicked “purely mathematical multifractals”. By his own estimation at the time he was writing it, Joyce was attempting to square the circle. “I am making an engine with only one wheel,” he told his benefactor Harriet Weaver. “No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I’m driving at, don’t you? […] It’s a wheel ... And it’s all square.” Joyce was of course born in a square, in 1882. But even then, there were complications. The square – Brighton Square in Rathgar – was and remains, notoriously, a triangle. The same Martello tower was the venue on Wednesday for the announcement of a new, marathon Bloomsday event, the first instalment of which will take place on June 14th. No, it’s not a mere reading marathon: there are plenty of those already. This will involve athletic activity, the more enthusiastic participants in which will cover 100km. The goal is to run from Sandycove to Mullingar, a town in which the young Joyce spent a formative summer and which also features in Ulysses. Hardline athletes will leave the Martello tower at 6am on the Saturday in question. But the event is not a race, organisers insist. Nor are most of those taking part are not expected to make the full trek. Other suggested starting points include Maynooth, Enfield and Kinnegad. Even 5km sections of the route are encouraged. The main thing is to get to Mullingar around 5pm, for further fun. The Joycean connection aside, half the point is to celebrate the aforementioned Royal Canal and its Greenway. Hence the “Royal Canal Odyssey”, to give the event its full name. More details are at royalcanalodyssey.ie Getting back to advanced maths, I was briefly alarmed by the subheading on our restaurant review yesterday: “Tucked away above a main street bar, Blackrock gets its Barcelona moment.” The thought of Blackrock being tucked away in the upstairs room of a pub somewhere suggested an experiment by Flann O’Brien’s mad scientist De Selby gone wrong. He was last seen running amok in a neighbouring suburb (The Dalkey Archive, 1964). But his creator was a regular in at least one Blackrock pub, so De Selby could well have been implicated here too. Happily, as the story revealed, Blackrock has not turned into a black hole. It’s only a new restaurant that is tucked away over a bar, not that the entire suburb has collapsed in on itself. This must have been a great relief to all concerned. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Activism OffGuardian Our successor to This Week in the Guardian, This Week in the New Normal is our weekly chart of the progress of autocracy, authoritarianism and economic restructuring around the world. Klaus Schwab, founder and leader of the World Economic Forum, is “beginning the process” of stepping down from his duties as chairman of the board of trustees. This “process” is apparently going to take until at least January 2027, so right there you have to wonder how real any of this is at all. But there is precedent, as this announcement follows on from his resignation as Chief Executive in 2023, a role he was succeeded in by Norwegian politician Børge Brende. Now, while an 87 year old man (allegedly) retiring is not, of itself, newsworthy it does raise interesting questions. Such as “why now?” and “who is replacing him?” As to the former, I would guess it’s because Klaus is now tainted. He is too publicly associated with Covid and the “Great Reset”. His presence immediately turns people off, his ideas are instantly suspected. It’s the same reason you don’t see Bill Gates giving as many interviews as you did during Covid. These are the faces of the New Normal agenda, and as that agenda becomes more covert than overt the people who proudly nailed their colours to its mast need to be pushed aside so the greater work can continue. That’s not to say they are being actually rejected or their ideas repudiated, of course, just that their public association is damaging. In the latter case, one early rumor suggested Tony Blair would be taking the job, but (if my reasoning can be trusted) that was never likely. Replacing Schwab with Blair to reduce bad press is like replacing your toaster with a flamethrower so you don’t burn your muffins. Other potential replacements include the other members of the board – Christine Lagarde of the ECB, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. But they largely have the same issue as Blair – namely, they are creepy and everyone hates them. I would suspect that a good portion of the next 18 months of “stepping down process” will be spent holding auditions for some bland-faced Trudeau-like “nice guy” type who can say all the same things Uncle Klaus used to say, without looking and sounding like a Bond villain. Tariffs and Trump and trade are taking up the headlines right now, with online censorship and Adolescence rushing to fill any gaps. Behind that, the now-familiar strains of music still play on a loop. Digital currency this, Covid that and – among other things – Bird Flu. Mexico’s Health Ministry recorded its first official human case of Bird Flu this week, according to Reuters In India, it’s being reported that a two-year-old child died of bird flu after eating raw chicken. The details are unclear, but on the face of it that story makes no sense. In England, DEFRA have ordered stricter measures be put in place in the north after more cases of H5N1 were allegedly found in wild birds. The Conversation warns that bird flu “could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans”. There’s some background noise building. Just in time for an Easter – or post-Easter – scare maybe? I’m not a monster, screams the headline, but I regret having children: And you know what, fine. Maybe regretting having children doesn’t make you a monster, but writing an article about it that your children will likely one day see, does. But that’s just taking the story at face value. The author is anonymous, the names apparently made up, so maybe the whole thing is just a piece of propaganda attacking the idea of having a family. We’re all more than used to the “free speech is hurting our kids!” argument; there’s always someone somewhere mewling out some variation. This week that someone is Ian Russell, an “online safety campaigner”, and the somewhere is BBC Newsnight: "We cannot keep waiting for change to come." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, says there is a "rising anger" amongst bereaved families and calls for Ofcom to be "less timid".#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/W0B9jgrG6j My favourite bit is the part where he says that OfCom need to be “less timid” about enforcing an act…that only came into force 3 weeks ago. I also like how vague the term “real change” is. Just a little tip: When pundits get vague it’s for one of two reasons. Either they don’t know what they’re talking about, or they know the specifics will make them sound stupid. I’m guessing, in this instance, it’s the second one. All told a pretty hectic week for the new normal crowd, and we didn’t even mention the Colorado Bill that classify misgendering your child as “child abuse” or San Francisco’s “equity-based” speeding tickets, which charge you more (or less) depending on your income.

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026.

Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

By Paige Gross, Stateline.org The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two. It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today. “Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.” As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information. For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say. “We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.” As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai. To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade. As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year. “And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.” The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively. Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing. Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said. “If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.” Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027. As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges. The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported. Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE. Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills. Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community. “The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said. Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers. But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand. “The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said. The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found. Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said. “The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.” Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January. The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said. “I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.” For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit. Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example. With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high. “We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?” Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center. Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed” large data centers. Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices. “It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’” ©2025 States Newsroom.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Movies How Movie Studio Spies Size Up the Competition Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Mumbai: Jio Financial Services Ltd. infused additional equity of ₹1,346 crore into its group entities in FY25 to fuel “future growth aspirations and support the growing scale of the diverse businesses”. The group entities that received the funding include Jio Finance Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, and the joint ventures with BlackRock for asset management and wealth management, the company said as part of its earnings for the fourth quarter of FY25. Jio Financial is the listed core investment company (CIC), which acts as the holding company for eleven group entities, including the three joint ventures with US-based BlackRock—Jio BlackRock Investment Advisors for the broking and wealth business, Jio BlackRock Asset Management and Jio BlackRock Trustee Pvt Ltd for the mutual fund business. Read more: For Wipro, tariff-led macro uncertainty makes things messy The parent said the senior leadership and core business teams are in place for the asset management company, which filed its application for final approval in FY25. The company has also developed a unified investment platform and deployed infrastructure to launch “with a defined product roadmap and go-to-market strategy”. The company filed an application for a broking licence in March 2025, and another under the wealth business for a registered investment advisor licence. With these lines of business, the current focus is on the mass affluent and higher income segments, the company said. It defines mass affluent as customers with an annual income of ₹7-25 lakh, affluent as those with an income of ₹25 lakh to ₹1 crore a year, and high net worth individuals (HNIs) and ultra HNIs as those with even higher incomes. "The year was defined by swift product launches, strengthening distribution across key markets, and rapid growth in the JioFinance app’s user base. In FY26, we will build upon this momentum by leveraging our integrated data infrastructure and AI-driven analytics to offer the right product to the right customer, through the right channel,” said managing director and chief executive Hitesh Sethia.

Profit after tax for FY25 was ₹1,613 crore, slightly higher than ₹1,605 crore in the previous year, with a rise in staff and operating expenses, and provisions, weighing on the bottom line. Consolidated assets of the company fell 7.8% on-year to ₹1.3 trillion, led by a reduction in the value of investments and cash and bank balances. Assets under management of the lending and leasing business, under Jio Finance Ltd, grew nearly 2.5-fold on-year to ₹10,053 crore as at the end of March 2025.

Hi Tim, Just wanted to comment on the quote you have on today’s 5 Bullet Friday. This may come off as a too pessimistic of a perspective, and I guess Buckingham gives this insight as a part of a broader context that is cohesive and sensible, but I want to share my first thought nevertheless: Finding the most generous explanation for the other’s behavior each time and believing it will bring a collossal misery and grief if the other person is a gaslighter with narcissistic tendencies. I’d humbly say the key is getting to know the person in one’s personal, and business, relationships in a realistic way, which is not an easy feat. Just my two cents.

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers.

"Rising AI restrictions are likely to impact other key AI-levered computing, networking and optical stocks (AVGO, AMD, MU, ARM, MRVL, COHR, LITE) and raise concerns around enhanced restrictions in other areas," Bank of America analysts said following the news from Nvidia.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Many are sitting on a goldmine of skills and will retire, not realizing what they could have ... More achieved in their lifetime You’ve likely helped a college friend rewrite their resume, explained a process clearly to a co-worker, or simplified a tech tool when a family member just wasn’t getting it. You never charged for these services. But while you’re not charging…someone else is. Most people sit on skills that could easily be turned into an asset that makes them anywhere from $500, to $5,000, or even five figures a month. But, like you, they overlook them and write these skills off as normal, nothing special. Unfortunately, when finances are tight, the cost of living is up, layoffs are looming, and inflation creeps into everyday items like eggs or major purchases like buying a house--they’re stuck with no options when they had plenty of options, they could have utilized all along. Are you sitting on a goldmine of skills that could be the key to unlocking financial freedom and career satisfaction? Let’s find out. To begin with, we’ll conduct a self-audit. Answering these questions helps uncover potential hidden skills--skills which you’ve had for a long while and are inherent to your nature, but which you haven't capitalized on because you don't think they're that significant. If you’re still struggling to identify yours, here are some examples that will spark your creative brainstorming, including what income sources they could lead to: Now that you’re ready to position yourself for success and take the leap in bringing your skills to the world, they’re no longer hidden; they’re going to be the number one thing you’re known for and associated with. To do this, you must ask yourself, Who needs a service that predominantly utilizes this skill? You can even ask ChatGPT to help you come up with ideas so you can brainstorm several side hustle ideas or business ideas using the skills that you have. This will give you an idea of what services you can bring to the market. Now conduct some research and pick a niche. Make it precise and highly specific. If you’re too general with your offer, you’ll appeal to no one at all. After doing this, clearly define your offer and what the expected positive outcome would be. Once you’ve laid this foundation, it’s time to build visibility and credibility online. You achieve this through creating digital assets such as: Acquiring testimonials from people you’ve worked with before, or delivering the service for free in return for reviews, to no more than five people Finally, price your skill according to value, not based on time or hours worked. Pricing by the hour limits your earning potential and leads to you inadvertently under-pricing your worth. Now, here’s the exciting part: where do you go to sell your skill and the service connected with it? Here are some examples (bear in mind that not all will be relevant depending on your business and industry vertical, but you can combine several of these together to get results): You can even create an entire online persona revolving around your once hidden skill, and end up becoming the face of it. Your skills are your best kept secret Your skills are your best kept secret. It’s time for the world to know who you really are. Stop sitting on your gifts. Instead of saying, “It’s nothing special,” begin treating all of your skills like assets.

Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period may, no later than APRIL 28, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch and spacecraft design services. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Title: Here are all the tech companies rolling back DEI or still committed to it — so far | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google also removed underrepresented language from its grant website and scrubbed mention of diversity and equity from its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post that it would remain committed to DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Salesforce is getting rid of its diversity hiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Uber eliminated an incentive tied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value. It removed the entire diversity and inclusion section from its latest 10-K filing and made no use of the word diversity at all, according to the SF Examiner. UnitedHealth Group removed mention of DEI from much of its website. For example, several pages once dedicated to DEI no longer load, and the company also removed a 2022 blog post with a vice president about DEI. Yahoo removed several pages and sections that relate to or mention diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, its DEI page now redirects to the company’s executive leadership page, and the 2022 diversity report no longer loads. (Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of TechCrunch. On March 21, Regent announced it would acquire TechCrunch.) Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Title: Eli Lilly's weight loss pill could be just as good as Ozempic — and the stock soars

The first GLP-1 pill could be in medicine cabinets sooner than expected. Eli Lilly (LLY) announced Thursday that its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, met company goals in the first of several late-stage trials — helping patients with Type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar while causing weight loss. The results were comparable with other GLP-1 injections on the market, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro. Orforglipron could give Lilly a key advantage over other pharmaceutical giants in the GLP-1 realm. Lilly’s stock was up 11% in premarket trading. Novo Nordisk (NVO), which makes Ozempic, was down 6%. The results are pivotal: While the GLP-1 class of medication has become a blockbuster on the market (both for diabetes treatment and weight loss), they’re expensive, must be injected, and need to be kept refrigerated. A pill version would be a more convenient option that could be much more widely used. Lilly expects to file for global regulatory approval of orforglipron for weight management by the end of the year and for Type 2 diabetes in 2026. The phama giant currently sells Zepbound and Mounjaro for diabetes and weight loss — both of which are administered by injection. Orforglipron is the first small-molecule GLP-1 taken without food and water restrictions to successfully complete a Phase 3 trial. In a press release, the company said that if the drug is approved, Lilly is “confident in its ability to launch orforglipron worldwide without supply constraints.” Shortages of currently available GLP-1 medications have been a prevalent issue recently. David Ricks, Lilly’s CEO and chair, said, “As a convenient once-daily pill, orforglipron may provide a new option and, if approved, could be readily manufactured and launched at scale for use by people around the world.” Lilly’s pill involves complicated science that makes a nonpeptide act like a peptide. Japanese company Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. (RHHBY), which figured out how to do just that, licensed its drug to Lilly in 2018. The resulting medication is a bit of a unicorn in the medical world: a peptide drug pill that can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill, Rybelsus, but it isn’t as effective as Lilly’s pill — it must be taken in large doses and also isn’t as effective as injectables because most of it is digested. Thursday’s results from Lilly are the first reported from seven large studies of orforglipron that are expected this year from the company. This first Phase 3 trial involved 559 people with Type 2 diabetes across the U.S., China, India, Japan, and Mexico — who either took orforglipron or a placebo for 40 weeks. In patients who received the medication, blood sugar levels dropped by about the same amount that patients taking Ozempic or Mounjaro experienced over that same period. The study measured weight loss as a secondary goal. Patients who received orforglipron also reported weight loss — up to 16 pounds without reaching a plateau, meaning more weight loss was possible on the medication. The 40-week results were similar to what patients taking Ozempic experienced but slightly less than those taking Mounjaro. Lilly’s trial participants reported side effects similar to other GLP-1s: diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Lilly said it expects Type 2 diabetes to affect an estimated 760 million adults by 2050. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of Americans are obese — and more than 10% have diabetes (most of whom have Type 2). According to a May 2024 study from KFF, 62% of adults who have taken GLP-1 drugs said they took them to treat a chronic condition (including diabetes or heart disease), and four in 10 adults said they took the drugs to lose weight.

This first Phase 3 trial involved 559 people with Type 2 diabetes across the U.S., China, India, Japan, and Mexico — who either took orforglipron or a placebo for 40 weeks. In patients who received the medication, blood sugar levels dropped by about the same amount that patients taking Ozempic or Mounjaro experienced over that same period. The study measured weight loss as a secondary goal. Patients who received orforglipron also reported weight loss — up to 16 pounds without reaching a plateau, meaning more weight loss was possible on the medication. The 40-week results were similar to what patients taking Ozempic experienced but slightly less than those taking Mounjaro. Lilly’s trial participants reported side effects similar to other GLP-1s: diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Lilly said it expects Type 2 diabetes to affect an estimated 760 million adults by 2050. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of Americans are obese — and more than 10% have diabetes (most of whom have Type 2). According to a May 2024 study from KFF, 62% of adults who have taken GLP-1 drugs said they took them to treat a chronic condition (including diabetes or heart disease), and four in 10 adults said they took the drugs to lose weight.

Title: Nvidia's CEO went to China and promised to 'unswervingly serve the Chinese market'

Time Published: 2025-04-17T15:12:17Z

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT) reported. The H20 — a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions — had become central to the company’s China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia’s stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday. While in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia’s commitment to the market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” Back in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules — particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips. As Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” The firm called the chip ban the “first shots fired” in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7–10%. While the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year — over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar. And with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang’s balancing act — between regulatory compliance and global expansion — just got significantly harder.

A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Time Published: 2025-04-17T13:30:00Z
Full Content:
April 17, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Zealand Tire market was valued at US$ 800.24 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1,312.16 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.40% during the forecast period 2025–2033. New Zealand’s Tire market is undergoing a transformative shift toward sustainability, driven by stringent environmental regulations and eco-conscious consumers. In 2024, the government’s Tirewise stewardship scheme, which mandates Tire producers to fund recycling initiatives, has spurred innovation in material recovery. For instance, 68% of end-of-life Tires are now repurposed into asphalt or playground surfaces, up from 52% in 2022. Major brands like Bridgestone and Goodyear have introduced Tires with 30–40% recycled rubber content, targeting urban consumers in Auckland and Wellington, where eco-awareness is highest. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/new-zealand-tire-market These shifts are altering supply chains of the Tire market in the country. Local distributors partner with Michelin to test silica-based compounds that reduce rolling resistance by 15%, enhancing fuel efficiency. However, small retailers in rural regions face cost barriers, with sustainable Tires priced 20% higher than conventional ones. To bridge this gap, startups like KiwiTires leverage crowdfunding to subsidize eco-friendly options for farmers. Consumer surveys reveal that 63% of buyers under 40 prioritize sustainability over brand loyalty, compelling manufacturers to recalibrate R&D budgets. This trend is redefining competition, as environmental compliance emerges as a key differentiator. Key Findings in New Zealand Tire Market Regulatory Pressures Accelerate Adoption of Smart Tire Technologies New Zealand’s transport safety regulations, updated in 2023, now require fleet operators to use Tires with embedded sensors for real-time tread monitoring. This has propelled a 45% annual growth in smart Tire sales since 2022, with logistics giants like Mainfreight adopting Bridgestone’s ‘Tire Logic’ systems in the Tire market. These sensors detect pressure loss and alignment issues, reducing roadside failures by 27% in heavy vehicles. Auckland-based start-up Torc Analytics offers retrofit sensor kits, capturing 12% of the regional commercial market. Despite progress, consumer adoption lags. Only 18% of private vehicle owners use smart Tires, citing high upfront costs (averaging NZ$400 per Tire). To counter this, Firestone’s ‘Pay-as-You-Drive’ subscription model links Tire costs to mileage, appealing to ride-share drivers in Christchurch. Meanwhile, insurers like AA offer 10% premium discounts for sensor-equipped cars, incentivizing uptake. Challenges persist in standardizing data protocols, as fragmented systems complicate fleet management. Regulatory nudges and tech partnerships will dominate this segment’s growth trajectory through 2025. Import Dependency and Currency Volatility Strain Pricing Strategies New Zealand’s Tire market remains tethered to Asian manufacturing hubs, with nine out of ten Tires imported from countries like Thailand, China, and Indonesia. This dependency exacerbates pricing instability, particularly for agricultural and industrial segments reliant on specialized imports. For instance, Firestone’s Maxi Traction IF Tires—a staple for Canterbury dairy farms—are produced in Thailand, where shipping delays due to Red Sea disruptions in early 2024 inflated costs by NZ$85 per unit. Concurrently, the New Zealand dollar’s depreciation against Asian currencies forced dealers like TireHub to markup premium tractor Tires by 12%, squeezing mid-sized farmers already grappling with low milk payouts. Efforts to diversify sourcing face logistical hurdles in the Tire market. Bridgestone’s pivot to Indonesian suppliers for its popular “V-Steel” tractor range reduced lead times by three weeks, but Tauranga Port’s congestion caused 20-day delays for Southland’s planting season. Some retailers mitigate volatility through pre-hedged contracts: AGrowQuip, a North Island Agri-tech dealer, locks in euro-based pricing for Michelin’s sprayer Tires six months in advance, shielding clients from 40% of forex fluctuations. However, grey-market imports from Malaysia—often lacking NZTA certification—undercut authorized dealers by 25%, compromising safety standards in regions like Waikato. Regional Climate Variations Drive Demand for Specialized Tire Formulations New Zealand’s microclimates necessitate hyper-localized Tire engineering, particularly for agriculture. Independent field tests in the Waikato region revealed Firestone’s Maxi Traction IF Tires improved traction by 15% on waterlogged soils compared to conventional models, critical for heavy harvesters navigating autumn rains. In Otago’s alpine zones, Cooper Tires’ “WeatherMaster” line incorporates silica compounds that retain flexibility at -10°C, reducing frost-induced cracking by 60% during winter trials. Coastal challenges demand equally tailored solutions in the New Zealand Tire market. Pirelli’s “Scorpion All-Terrain Plus”, engineered for Northland’s salt-laden air, uses corrosion-resistant bead wires to extend lifespan by 18 months in mussel-farming regions. Yet, low-volume production inflates costs: a single 16.9R34 “Mud-Shed” Tire for West Coast logging costs NZ$1,200—double the price of standard variants—due to bespoke moulds required for clay-shedding treads. Bridgestone’s modular retread kits address this, allowing Gisborne citrus growers to swap seasonal tread patterns for under NZ$300 per Tire, blending cost efficiency with climatic adaptability. E-Commerce Platforms Disrupt Traditional Tire Distribution Channels Online sales now account for one-third of NZ’s replacement Tire market, with agricultural buyers leading the shift. TireHub’s e-commerce portal, offering AI-driven fitment tools for tractors and harvesters, reduced misorder rates by 30% in 2024, particularly for complex SKUs like Firestone’s 480/80R50 radial flotation Tires. Urban consumers flock to platforms like TireSlick for price transparency, but rural adoption hinges on hybrid logistics: FastTire’s partnership with Farmlands Co-operative enables stock pickup at 78 rural service centers, slashing last-mile costs by NZ$45 per order. Traditional retailers counter with value-added services in the Tire market. Beaurepaires’ “Tire Connect” portal provides real-time inventory tracking for niche agricultural Tires like BKT’s 18.4-16 R1 Row Crop models, while its in-house leasing program covers 80% of maintenance costs for loyal clients. However, counterfeit risks persist online: 12% of Facebook Marketplace listings for “discounted” Pirelli SprayMaster Tires failed NZTA’s load index tests in 2024, prompting Federated Farmers to issue a national advisory. Explore customization options: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/new-zealand-tire-market Agricultural Sector’s Shift to Precision Farming Influences Tire Specifications Precision farming’s rise has redefined Tire market’s performance metrics. Firestone’s “CycleMax” technology, integrated into 70% of Waikato’s GPS-guided tractors, uses pressure sensors to reduce soil compaction by 22%—a critical factor for dairy farms targeting pasture recovery. In Marlborough’s vineyards, Michelin’s “VitiSpray” Tires, with 12% narrower contact patches, minimize root damage during spraying cycles, cutting replanting costs by NZ$8,000 per hectare annually. Yet, adoption gaps persist. Small-scale sheep stations in the Mackenzie Basin struggle with the NZ$14,000 outlay for telemetry-compatible radial Tires, prompting Bridgestone to pilot a carbon-credit leasing model. Under this scheme, farmers using low-compaction Tires earn credits redeemable against future purchases—a strategy already adopted by 15% of Otago’s high-country stations. Meanwhile, legacy equipment compatibility remains a hurdle: nearly 40% of Hawke’s Bay’s vintage tractors still run cross-ply Tires, which lack the pressure adjustability needed for precision systems. Urbanization and Ride-Sharing Trends Reshape Replacement Cycles in Tire Market New Zealand’s urban population growth (2.1% annually since 2020) and booming ride-share usage (12M trips monthly in Auckland) are shortening Tire replacement cycles. Uber drivers replace Tires every 18 months, compared to 3 years for private users, driving a 28% uptick in high-mileage Tire sales. Hankook’s ‘Kinergy PT’ promises 80,000-km durability, securing contracts with Zoomy and Ola. Parking constraints in cities like Wellington boost demand for run-flat Tires, which constitute 17% of urban sales. However, 43% of workshops lack specialized equipment to repair them, creating bottlenecks. Service providers in the New Zealand Tire market like Bridgestone Select invest in training programs to address this gap. As ride-sharing penetrates regional hubs (e.g., Hamilton and Tauranga), tier-2 cities are becoming battlegrounds for fleet-focused Tire brands.

Title: Markets search for footing as earnings roll in and Washington deflects blame

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Boeing (BA) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China. The broader tech sector continues to grapple with geopolitical fallout, regulatory uncertainty, and earnings jitters. The Nasdaq remains down about 15% year to date. As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and recent earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds.

In a speech Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment, and warned that Trump’s tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth. He also suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be extra relevant as some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature.

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and recent earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. In a speech Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment, and warned that Trump’s tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth.

More displayed on a smartphone with a Microsoft logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The current period presents concerns for broader markets, which inevitably create challenges for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Growing economic anxieties in the United States, fueled by the implementation of tariffs and an escalating trade war, are fostering a generally unfavorable market climate. While Microsoft’s stock has not been immune, declining from nearly $450 in January to around $370, its drop has been less severe than some other tech stocks. This relative resilience can be attributed to Microsoft’s limited exposure to China (reportedly low-single-digits contribution to sales) and its focus on the software and cloud side of its business, offering some insulation from global trade tensions. Separately see – ASML Stock To $400? The question now is whether to buy MSFT stock at $370. We think so. Our positive outlook is based on a comprehensive analysis comparing Microsoft’s current valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its present and historical financial standing. This assessment, which considers key parameters such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, reveals that Microsoft possesses a very strong operating performance and a robust financial condition, as will be detailed further. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. Microsoft's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Microsoft’s profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft's balance sheet looks very strong. MSFT stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Microsoft's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Given Microsoft's very strong performance across key parameters, the stock presents an attractive investment opportunity. While its valuation may appear high when compared to the broader market, Microsoft's current trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30x is actually lower than its three-year average of 33x. Coupled with the continued robust growth expected from its cloud offerings, Microsoft appears to be a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors at the current levels. Although near-term volatility related to ongoing tariffs does pose a risk, for investors with a time horizon of 3 to 5 years, we believe MSFT is a sound stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. logo is seen displayed ... More on a monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock appears relatively expensive, making it a costly investment at its current price of around $93. We believe there are some minor issues with AMD stock that contribute to its high valuation. The surge in generative AI has fueled strong GPU demand, but AMD’s AI accelerator segment has fallen short of expectations. In Q4, AMD’s data center revenue—a key indicator of its AI chip performance—was $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. The company also issued a soft outlook, noting that current-quarter data center sales may decline 7% sequentially. Former President Donald Trump’s trade policies could also pose risks to companies like AMD. While there is limited clarity on the semiconductor tariffs due to inconsistent messaging from the White House, the threat remains for AMD, as it sources most of its chips from Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Additionally, AMD has a thinner margin buffer to withstand tariffs compared to competitors like Nvidia due to its lower gross margins. Our assessment of Advanced Micro Devices using key parameters like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows the company is strong operationally and financially, despite its rich valuation. For those seeking returns with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers an alternative—it has outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered over 91% returns since inception. Relative to sales and profit, AMD stock appears quite expensive compared to the broader market. • AMD has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6 versus 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) is 69.0 vs. 21.3 for the S&P 500 • The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 87.7 compared to 21.3 for the benchmark Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have grown significantly in recent years. • The company has recorded an average revenue growth of 17.8% over the past 3 years (vs. 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Revenues have increased 13.7% from $23 Bil to $26 Bil in the past 12 months (vs. 5.3% growth for the S&P 500) • Its latest quarterly revenue rose 24.2% to $7.7 Bil from $6.2 Bil a year ago (vs. 4.9% growth for the S&P 500) AMD’s profit margins lag behind most firms covered by Trefis. • Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.1 Bil, reflecting a low Operating Margin of 8.1% (vs. 13.1% for S&P 500) • Operating Cash Flow was $3.0 Bil, implying a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 11.8% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) AMD’s balance sheet appears robust. • The company had $2.2 Bil in debt at the end of the latest quarter versus a $152 Bil market cap (as of 4/11/2025), resulting in a very low Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.5% (vs. 21.5% for S&P 500) [Note: Lower is better] • With $5.1 Bil in cash among $69 Bil in total assets, AMD has a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (vs. 15.0% for S&P 500) AMD has underperformed the S&P 500 during several past downturns. Concerned about a crash? Check out our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? and see detailed comparisons to past market crashes. • Stock fell 65.4% from $161.91 (Nov 29, 2021) to $55.94 (Oct 14, 2022), while S&P 500 declined 25.4% • Fully recovered to prior peak by Jan 18, 2024 • Rose to $211.38 on Mar 7, 2024, and now trades at ~$93 • Dropped 34.3% from $58.90 (Feb 19) to $38.71 (Mar 16), nearly matching S&P 500's 33.9% drop • Recovered to pre-crisis level by Jul 22, 2020 • Plunged 91.2% from $20.35 (Jan 2007) to $1.80 (Nov 2008), vs. S&P 500's 56.8% drop • Recovered by Aug 21, 2018 Here’s how AMD fares across key metrics: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak • Overall: Neutral Given its lofty valuation, AMD stock looks relatively expensive, which aligns with our conclusion that it is currently not an ideal buy. The high valuation restricts upside in the near to mid-term. Instead, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed a combined all-cap index benchmark. Why? Its quarterly-rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks helps capture gains in strong markets while limiting losses in downturns, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Tariffs Will Affect Grocery Prices, According to an Agro-Economics Professor

We asked an agriculture and economics expert about where consumers can expect food price hikes in the future. Grocery prices may rise even further if Trump's tariffs go back into effect. President Donald Trump's trade war has been a wild-moving target with severe economic implications. The most recent announcement and subsequent 90-day pause of tariffs affected thousands of imports from dozens of countries and sent the stock market reeling, but what could sweeping tariffs on China and other countries mean for food and grocery prices? Hours before the pause on Trump's newest tariffs was announced, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for everyday shoppers in the US. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are If you're just catching up, on April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. Days later, when the tariffs went into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. While it's still unclear whether the Trump Administration will extend the 90-day pause on the rest of the previously announced tariffs, the large tariff on China could still have an impact on American food costs. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge [or tariff] on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the European Union -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." The tariffs may cause supply issues leading to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Many of the Avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump Administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) finished more than 22% lower Thursday in the stock's worst day in over 25 years after the health-care giant's first-quarter results fell short of analysts' estimates and it cut its profit forecasts for 2025. UnitedHealth reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.20 on revenue that rose 10% year-over-year to $109.58 billion. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $7.25 and $111.46 billion, respectively. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based company lowered its 2025 EPS outlook to a range of $24.65 to $25.15 and its adjusted EPS projection to $26 to $26.50. Last quarter, UnitedHealth said it expected to generate full-year EPS of $28.15 to $28.65 and adjusted EPS from $29.50 to $30. UnitedHealth attributed the outlook cuts to "heightened care activity indications" in its Medicare Advantage business, and "unanticipated changes in the profile of Optum Health members impacting planned 2025 reimbursement." Analysts have said rising medical costs and lower government reimbursements for Medicare Advantage claims mean higher expenses for insurers that operate those plans like UnitedHealth, CNBC reported. As UnitedHealth shares closed Thursday with their fourth-worst performance since the company went public in 1984, shares of other health insurers like CVS Health (CVS), Humana (HUM), Elevance Health (ELV), and Centene (CNC) also were dragged lower Thursday by the cost concerns. CEO Andrew Witty said the company "did not perform up to our expectations, and we are aggressively addressing those challenges to position us well for the years ahead." UnitedHealth shares entered the day up about 16% since the start of the year, recovering from a February slump following a report that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the company's diagnosing practices. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information and analysis.

TSMC earned $25.77 billion in revenue in Q1 2025 vs. expectations of $25.72 billion. For Q2, the fab giant expects to haul in revenues of between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion (midpoint at $28.8 billion). Based on its visible H1 run-rate, TSMC is now on course to haul in $109 billion in revenue for FY 2025. — U.S. TARIFFS HAVE NOT IMPACTED CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; DEMAND CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED SUPPLY. — PRODUCTION YIELDS IN ARIZONA ARE COMPARABLE TO TAIWAN FACILITIES; EXPECTED THAT 30% OF 2NM CAPACITY WILL EVENTUALLY BE BASED IN ARIZONA.$TSM $TSMC https://t.co/zHGRc3jKs6 — Michael Kitara (@MichaelKitara) April 17, 2025 Elsewhere, while conceding to the US tariff-related uncertainties ahead, TSMC says that it has seen no impact on customer behavior so far. As a refresher, NVIDIA and AMD have both disclosed significant financial hits from the Trump administration's recent imposition of licensing requirements on the H20 and MI308 GPUs, respectively. Also, TSMC has declared that the yields in its Arizona fab are now comparable to those in its Taiwan facilities. Moreover, the company now intends to increase its investments in the US to $165 billion. TSMC has no intention of forming joint ventures or engaging in technology sharing with other companies. (@intel) Puts stop to all the rumors. $TSM — Parv sharma (@Parv_S) April 17, 2025 Of course, the most critical comment to come out of TSMC's earnings call was its refusal to enter into any JV or technology transfer agreements with other companies, read Intel. Bear in mind that reports in recent days indicated that Intel and TSMC had apparently reached an understanding to constitute a JV that would then manage Intel's US-based fabs. The arrangement would have also roped in other chip designers such as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple. For its part, TSMC would have retained a 20 percent stake in the JV, financed via its in-kind contribution of technology and expertise. The Taiwanese fab giant, however, has now clearly denied any possibility of just such an outcome. Citi, of course, has remained skeptical of a JV between TSMC and Intel from the beginning, going on to declare: "We do not believe TSMC operating/forming a JV with Intel would work given differences in manufacturing and operations."

Title: Inside WPP’s $150 million InfoSum purchase
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/inside-wpps-150-million-infosum-purchase/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Editor’s Note: This piece was updated and then re-edited to reflect GroupM’s characterization of WPP’s relationship to the market. WPP’s acquisition of data clean room InfoSum has raised eyebrows both inside and outside the industry, not just because of what it signals about the holding company’s ambitions but also because of what it reveals about its anxieties. Let’s start with the upside. The holdco has bought a business it believes, rightly or wrongly, can bolster its cash cow: GroupM. The media buying unit has faced those pressures for some time, and those cracks have played a role in several high-profile client departures over the past year. Yes, WPP has chalked up some headline wins recently — Amazon and Unilever, to name a couple — but there’s no denying that whatever GroupM is selling, CMOs aren’t buying it like they used to. The pitch is simple enough. InfoSum’s clean room uses federated learning to let marketers work with sensitive data without actually moving or exposing it. In theory, this enables rich insights by combining first-party data with a vast pool of privacy-safe signals — hundreds of billions of them — sourced from the likes of Netflix, Samsung Ads, and Channel 4, along with data partners like Experian and TransUnion. It’s the kind of offering that could further GroupM’s ongoing efforts to stitch together insights across fragmented platforms. But for all the strategic logic, the road ahead is murky. For all InfoSum’s promise, the clean room category itself is in transition. Once heralded as the cornerstone of privacy-first advertising, clean rooms lost some of their shine once marketers realized they solved only part of the puzzle. On their own, they don’t deliver the scale, simplicity, or seamless outcomes CMOs expect, especially in a landscape preferring retail media channels where data activation and measurement come bundled. In addition to the high costs, technical complexity, and limited interoperability, it’s easy to see why clean rooms have struggled to scale as point solutions. More and more, they’re being folded into larger tech stacks or absorbed into cloud infrastructure — seen as less of a strategy and more of a supporting feature. WPP may view InfoSum as a strategic linchpin for GroupM and Choreograph, but the bigger question is whether it can transform a specialized tool into something that moves the whole machine. And then there’s the trust problem. InfoSum’s appeal was built over nearly a decade on neutrality — a Switzerland for sensitive data. That’s a much harder pitch now. No matter how WPP frames it, it’s tough to imagine rival holding companies lining up to upload customer data into a platform now owned by one of their fiercest competitors. The promise of independence, once central to InfoSum’s volume, is up for debate the moment its ownership changes hands. Little wonder, then, that the deal has left some WPP clients, partners and even rivals scratching their heads over its swoop for InfoSum. One GroupM client told Digiday they had reservations over how the deal would really add value to the agency network. “Even before the deal, we were already considering whether to put the account up for review at some point this year or next,” the marketer said. Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun highlighted the challenges of integrating a clean room like InfoSum into a wider proposition during the company’s earnings call earlier this week, underscoring how closely the industry is watching not just what WPP bought but what it will now do with it. “A clean room alone is an empty shell,” said Sadoun. “If you don’t add proprietary data that will bring to your client something that they don’t have then they won’t find a new source of goals. They won’t be able to connect every individual to the entire media ecosystem.” In the weeks leading up to the purchase, InfoSum pursued a $25 million Series C investment — it raised $93 million across its prior funding rounds. InfoSum CEO Lauren Wetzel told Digiday WPP was eager to participate in the round, but it soon evolved into a wholesale takeover. “About a week out from closing the Series C, one of those investors who was new to the cap table along with WPP shifted gears and felt very strongly there was more of an opportunity for a [sale] transaction,” she added. WPP did not disclose the sum it paid for its new acquisition in its April 3 announcement, prompting speculation over InfoSum’s final exit figure. This was further fueled when Chrysalis — the lead participant of InfoSum’s 2021 raise, when it was valued at $300 million — announced a $63 million liquidation of its stake in the U.K.-headquartered company on the same day. Estimated exit prices vary, although separate sources (both of whom were investors in InfoSum) told Digiday the eventual sale price was approximately $150 million. WPP declined Digiday’s requests to comment on these claims. While Wetzel didn’t comment on the financials of the sale, she spoke on the decision to switch from raising a Series C to signing off on an acquisition. “It was compelling for our investors,” she said, “and it had to be for me to change my mind.” Additionally, sources claimed InfoSum made dozens of layoffs in the weeks leading up to the purchase — Digiday understands this number is lower than 20 — a period when Companies House initiated compulsory strike-off proceedings. According to Wetzel, who is now also GroupM’s chief solutions officer, the March 4 notice, which marked the beginning of a process that could have resulted in InfoSum’s compulsory dissolution, was the result of its fundraising efforts. According to Wetzel, the timing of its efforts to raise a Series C round meant InfoSum deferred filing its accounts with the registry of all U.K. businesses. Thus, Companies House triggered the process, which Wetzel characterized as “pretty standard” given the context. Furthermore, in the weeks since the purchase was confirmed, industry observers raised how Brian Lesser, CEO of WPP’s GroupM, was chief executive of InfoSum as recently as July of last year and whether this amounted to a conflict of interest. Digiday was told that Lesser was not part of the acquisition process for this reason. Instead, a team of technical execs oversaw the transaction and is held to the same degree of third-party oversight as any other, according to WPP. The agency network, once the undisputed heavyweight of media buying, has spent the last few years walking a tightrope: trying to modernize its infrastructure without unraveling the scale that made it powerful in the first place. The result has been a kind of strategy stutter. Internally, leadership changes have only deepened the disorientation. Over the past 18 months, the exits of GroupM’s CEO in North America, Kirk McDonald, followed by GroupM CEO Christian Juhl being replaced by Lesser a year later, have left staff unsure of who’s steering the ship and in which direction. Lesser, in particular, made waves upon his return, declaring to Adweek that within five years, “there is no human that touches a media plan.” It was meant to signal ambition, especially when paired with the familiar refrain that AI won’t take jobs, but people who use it will. For some inside GroupM, though, it landed less like a rallying cry, more like a warning — an aspirational soundbite that glossed over the day-to-day friction of a network still figuring out how to move forward. “It seemed like there was very little regard for the people who are actually running the agency, ” said the partner, echoing what they described as widespread frustration among colleagues and friends still inside the network in reaction to the quote. Outside the network, things aren’t much better. On the new business, the media group trails its rivals. Last year it ranked third behind Omnicom Media Group and Publicis in net new and retained client wins with a total value of $3.5 billion, according to COMvergence, a global research firm that tracks agency pitches. When accounting for that value without losses, it climbed to second place with $8.7 billion, still behind Omnicom. “Clients are really souring on WPP — they’re not interested in the new direction it’s on,” said a pitch consultant on condition of anonymity. “WPP has been dormant while its biggest rivals have been proactive. That’s had an impact on GroupM, which doesn’t seem to have an exciting story to tell clients in the way that Publicis Media does.” Lesser has defended the network’s performance, arguing it’s paying for sins of the past. He also noted that GroupM has actually beaten out Publicis more recently. “I think the notion that WPP is not competitive is a little bit overplayed and dramatic,” he told Digiday last week when the InfoSum deal was announced. He added, “If you look at some of our wins from late last year, whether that be Amazon, or Unilever — taking the commerce business back off Publicis, because Unilever was unhappy there — and winning J & J in a direct head-to-head with Publicis. I think that we are very competitive in the market. And frankly, when you look at our financial results, that has more to do with things that we’ve lost in the past, that we’re just feeling the after-effects of.” The irony is that for all the talk of reinvention, GroupM’s future seems increasingly straddled with the same issues as its past: a clunky operating model, an over-reliance on scale, and an uneasy relationship with the very technology it’s banking on to save it. However, the DOJ failed to prove Google monopolized ad network market. Cloud Next 2025 showed how the giant wants AI to join creative departments.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 7% Wednesday after the company said it’s set to take a $5.5 billion charge as a result of U.S. restrictions on exports of its AI chips to China. The company said via a regulatory filing that it would be required to have an export license to sell its popular H20 chips to China amid concerns they could be used by Beijing to build a supercomputer. The development caught market watchers off guard, given Nvidia designed the H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to comply with Biden-era chip export curbs on advanced chips the former administration thought could be used by foreign adversaries. Nvidia shares have staged a modest recovery above this month’s low but have lost about a firth of their value since the start of the year as of Wednesday’s close amid uncertainty over Washington's trade policies and big tech AI spending. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching out for. After attracting buying interest near the lower trendline of a falling wedge pattern last week, Nvidia shares rallied sharply before running into selling pressure near the pattern’s top trendline. It’s worth noting that although the stock fell sharply in Wednesday’s trading session, the price formed a doji, a candlestick pattern suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. Let’s identify key support and resistance levels on Nvidia’s chart that investors may be monitoring. Nvidia shares fell 6.9% to close Wednesday's session at $104.49. Further selling in the stock could initially see the price revisit support around $96. This area may attract buyers near last year’s prominent March twin peaks, a location on the chart also situated just above this month’s tariff-driven low. The bulls’ failure to defend the April low could trigger a larger drop to the $76 level. Investors may look for buy-and-hold entry points in this region near last April’s notable swing low. A volume-backed breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s top trendline could drive a move to around $130, currently just above the 200-day moving average. The shares may face overhead resistance in this area near the August peak and December trough. Finally, buying above this level could see Nvidia shares climb to $150. Investors may decide to lock in profits at this price near several peaks that formed on the chart just below the stock’s record high set in early January. This area also aligns with a projected measured move price target that calculates the depth of the falling wedge in points and adds that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, adding $40 to $110 forecasts an upside target of $150. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Markets sank sharply on Wednesday after back-to-back tariff-related headlines from Nvidia and the Federal Reserve rattled investor confidence. The sell-off started after a disclosure on Tuesday evening after markets closed from Nvidia, which warned of a $5.5 billion hit due to export rules on H20 AI chips developed for the Chinese market. Nvidia appears to be caught in the increasing tension over tariffs between the US and China. Stock losses deepened after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell cautioned that renewed tariffs under the Trump administration could create a "challenging scenario" for the economy. He warned that the Fed's dual mandate — low unemployment and price stability— could be tested if tariffs drive up consumer prices while slowing growth. Here is how much each of the Magnificent 7 lost on Wednesday — and since Trump's inauguration — at market closing at 4 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.51% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2% Alphabet, Google's parent company, took a comparatively smaller loss on Wednesday but still saw about one-fifth of its stock value wiped out since Trump became president. In February, Nvidia replaced Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company. Alphabet donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Loss in stock value since January 21: 22.16% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2.93% Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, has lost about one-fifth of its share value since Trump's inauguration and could be hit further by tariffs, especially the up to 245% in duties imposed on China. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, and founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos attended. Small businesses selling on Amazon told Business Insider they are struggling to keep their doors open as their already razor-thin margins shrink further under tariffs. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.21% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.89% Apple shares briefly rallied on Monday on a surprise tariff exemption on key tech products, but the reprieve was short-lived. The tech giant is also planning to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 15.40% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.68% Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is currently facing a blockbuster antitrust trial with the Federal Trade Commission that opened on Monday and is expected to run up to eight weeks. The tech giant had donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.98% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.66% Microsoft has been rethinking its performance reviews and is mulling another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, after already having fired "low-performers" in January. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.33% Loss in stock value on April 16: 6.87% A main character of Wednesday's stock market woes, Nvidia, the chipmaking giant, took a heavy loss in shares and at one point neared a 10% loss before bouncing back toward market close. The semiconductor maker developed H20 AI chips for China but disclosed Tuesday that new US export restrictions have effectively blocked Nvidia from selling the inventory, which weighed down share values of the broader tech sector. Loss in stock value since January 21: 40.08% Loss in stock value on April 16: 4.94% Tesla, the EV giant, had an especially difficult year in terms of sales and share value for reasons that go beyond tariffs or generally low consumer sentiments. Public backlash over Musk's political involvement and ties to the White House's DOGE office resulted in mass protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles, and his focus on DOGE made investors question his commitment to the company. Elon Musk has donated over $260 million to support Trump's return to the White House, along with $12 million toward a failed conservative bid in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Jump to

Title: PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/graphics-cards/29396/pny-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-overclocked-dual-fan
Time Published: 2025-04-17T01:18:53Z
Full Content:
The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card.

The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here.

April 16, 2025 18:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years.

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years.

Title: Nvidia could be hit hard by the new chip export license. Analysts warn the big decision is still to come.

Time Published: 2025-04-16T20:48:24Z

Wall Street analysts had some choice words for the latest shake-up to Nvidia's regulatory landscape — "disruptive," "surprise," and "abrupt," just to name a few. Bernstein analysts went so far as to say "The Trump rug remains in full effect." New rules regarding Nvidia's Chinese business surprised many company stakeholders this week. On Tuesday, after market close, the company announced that it had been informed that the Trump administration would require a new license for all accelerated chips shipping to China and a small group of other countries including Russia. Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves in the first quarter, which ends on April 27. "Based on our discussions, this is effectively a ban," wrote UBS analysts in a note to investors Tuesday. Even those analysts unwilling to read the disclosure as a full-on ban said any licensing process is likely to be lengthy, so revenue from Nvidia's H20 chip, the one the company designed specifically to meet Biden-era export restrictions, is expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future. "This is not a ban; it's a licensing requirement, but again, the inventory write-down suggests that the company is not optimistic about being granted licenses," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. At the time of writing, the regulation has not appeared in the Federal Register or the Department of Commerce website, so all analyst reactions are related to Nvidia's disclosure. The company's stock was down more than 7% from Tuesday to Wednesday market close. A spokesperson from Nvidia declined to comment. Nvidia priced the charges it will likely incur in the first quarter (ending April 27) at $5.5 billion. However, there was no warning about the company's first-quarter results, which will be announced on May 28. Though China sales will almost certainly be lower than expected, several analysts expect the company may still be able to meet revenue targets for the first quarter. "Given the strong demand for H200 chips since DeepSeek's launch, we think NVDA could offset somewhat lost China H20 revenues," BNP Paribas analysts wrote. The same analysts estimated Nvidia's China data center business constitutes 10% to 12% of Nvidia's total revenue. UBS suggested earnings per share would fall by 20 cents, and Morgan Stanley analysts expect 8% to 9% of data center revenues to disappear in the near term. A decrease in ongoing sales to China was already expected. Restrictions on what the company is allowed to sell to China are not new. Hence the company has attempted to reduce its reliance on that market over the last two years. Since the H20 is only relevant to the Chinese market, oversupply won't affect Nvidia's sales of any other chips, Morgan Stanley wrote. Since Nvidia's chips are the most expensive in existence, and buyers still keep lining up, tariffs are less of a concern than export restrictions, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Beyond the Chinese market, there are bigger potential impacts looming. The Biden administration's AI diffusion rules are set to go into effect next month — and could have an even more material impact on Nvidia if enacted as is, since they restrict exports to many more countries such as Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, UAE, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and India. Since the White House and Nvidia have demonstrated some cooperation this week, with the Trump administration celebrating the company's announcements around expanded US manufacturing, analysts have converged around a theory about what comes next. "We are optimistic that the company's demonstrably good relationship with the government, as Trump tweeted yesterday, will mitigate these concerns," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Jump to

Title: Netflix Q1 Earnings Preview: Wall Street Expects Solid Results, Sees Stock as Safe Haven Amid Potential Economic Downturn

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Netflix, which financial analysts have crowned the undisputed subscription-streaming leader, kicks off the media and entertainment sector’s Q1 earnings this week. Wall Street anticipates that Netflix will report strong results for the period — the first quarter it will no longer disclose subscriber counts — and that the company is relatively well positioned to withstand economic headwinds. Netflix is scheduled to report Q1 2025 results Thursday, April 17, after market close. Wall Street consensus estimates are for quarterly revenue to come in at $10.51 billion (up 12% year over year) with earnings per share of $5.66 (up 7%), according to LSEG Data & Analytics. That’s slightly above the company’s previous guidance for revenue of $10.42 billion and EPS of $5.58. Related Stories VIP+ What the Music Industry Can Learn from Patreon & the Creator Economy Box Office: Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan's 'Sinners' Targeting Solid $45 Million Opening Weekend “Given macro volatility, we view Netflix as arguably the most defensive stock in our coverage universe amid any broader slowdown,” TD Cowen analysts led by John Blackledge said in an April 8 research note. Popular on Variety For starters, Netflix will not face any significant direct impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs. The TD Cowen analysts also cited “robust underlying biz demand from increasingly global content slate,” Netflix’s strong value proposition especially relative to out-of-home entertainment options, and continued “secular adoption of streaming video.” TD Cowen has a “buy” rating on Netflix with a 12-month price target of $1,150/share. So far in 2025, Netflix shares have outperformed the broader market: The stock is up more than 7% year to date, compared with a decline of more than 10% for the S&P 500 index amid President Trump’s tariff announcements and escalating trade war with China. Seaport Research Partners equity analyst David Joyce similarly noted that Netflix is “one of the cheapest forms of entertainment on a per-hour engagement basis. “Generally speaking, what makes NFLX (and other streamers, of course) a defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it is likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget,” Joyce wrote in an April 14 note. The monthly price of Netflix premium service in the U.S. costs as much as “a single Imax ticket in major markets for 2 hours, or one-fifth of the average price of a single Live Nation ticket for a 2-hour event — not to mention comparing to pro sports events or theme parks,” he added. Joyce rates Netflix a “buy” with a $1,025/share 12-month price target. As Netflix announced last year, beginning with the first quarter of 2025 it will stop reporting paid subscriber numbers and average revenue per member (ARM) on a regular quarterly basis, saying those aren’t as meaningful as user engagement or financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. (Netflix says it “will continue to announce paid memberships as we cross key milestones.”) For Q4 of 2024, Netflix reported 18.9 million net new global subscribers — around twice analyst expectations — to reach 301.6 million at year-end. With the decision to no longer report subscriber figures, “Netflix is now free to focus solely on revenue growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in an April 11 note. The company in January implemented price hikes across all tiers in the U.S. and other countries; even if that results in subscriber cancellations Netflix can “obscure subscriber churn and trade-downs while showing meaningful revenue growth.” In the absence of subscriber figures, TD Cowen’s Blackledge expects investors to look for updates around Netflix’s “burgeoning ad tier.” Netflix plans to launch first-party advertising tech stack in the U.S. in April after rolling it out in Canada, and “we’ll look for color around potential timing of the remaining 10 ad markets later in 2025,” Blackledge wrote. Netflix earlier this year raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion (up $500 million from its prior forecast) and for operating margin to be 29%, up one percentage point from its previous guidance. With $18 billion in content spending forecast for 2025, “there is meaningful upside potential to Netflix’s 2025 guidance,” Wedbush’s Reese wrote. VIP+ Analysis: Should Netflix Rivals Imitate Its Choice to Hold Back Subscriber Numbers? For 2025, the company has touted the return of three of its biggest TV shows — “Squid Game,” “Wednesday” and “Stranger Things” — and said it plans to “grow into new areas like live programming and games.” Of note, Netflix began streaming WWE “Monday Night Raw” exclusively in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Latin America on a weekly basis in January 2025. It also will reprise its NFL double-header on Christmas Day 2025. “Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding more live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,” Reese wrote. The analyst maintains an “outperform” rating on Netflix with a $1,150/share 12-month price target, reflecting a P/E multiple of 34X on Wedbush’s 2027 EPS estimate. Meanwhile, according to TD Cowen’s monthly survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers, Netflix continues to be the most popular way to watch video content in the living room. Asked which platform consumers use most often to view video content on their TV, Netflix retained the top spot in February 2025 with 25% of respondents, followed by YouTube (15%) and basic cable (10%). “We think Netflix’s broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time,” Blackledge wrote.

Title: Bieber Crisis of Faith?

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter A bitter management shake-up. Angry public outbursts. A “narcissistic” pastor whose word is gospel. What in God’s name is happening to the once-mighty pop icon? “Whatever he’s going through, I pray for him” a longtime collaborator says. By Shirley Halperin For the millions around the world wondering what Justin Bieber has been up to these past few years — since music seemingly took a back seat to his life as a full-time husband (he married Hailey Baldwin in 2018) and father (son Jack Blues was born in August) — it may be surprising to learn that the pop sensation did release something new this month. On April 3, the 31-year-old revealed his fashion brand, Skylrk, with a video directed by 3D artist Gal Yosef that shows an animated Bieber riding an electric scooter to a house that he then promptly burns. Strewn about inside are relics of his past life, including the smiley face logo of the Drew House clothing line he started in 2019 with former friend Ryan Good (Drew is Bieber’s middle name); outside, waiting while the residence goes up in flames, is his wife with a stroller. The two kiss and walk toward the setting sun holding hands, never turning back. Related Stories News Jordan Firstman Is Sharing All Your 'Secrets' News Joel Katz, Longtime Music Industry Attorney, Dies at 80 That Bieber chose a scooter running out of power as a visual element was presumably no coincidence. Scott “Scooter” Braun, the manager who discovered the Canadian talent through a YouTube video in 2008, has been a constant presence in Bieber’s life from age 13 through adulthood. During their 15 years together, Bieber launched into the pop stratosphere, becoming one of the most popular artists on the planet, today boasting more than 78 million monthly listeners on Spotify, where 17 of his songs — or songs he’s been featured on — have each amassed over a billion streams. Bieber’s rise was the stuff of fairy tales. Reality, as it turns out, is a much more complicated story that’s rooted in questions of loyalty, wealth and health.Indeed, Bieber has been torching his past in ways that aren’t just metaphorical. Professionally, he separated from his longtime team last summer, joining a number of uber-successful musicians who self-manage, like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars and Morgan Wallen. In taking the lead on his business affairs, the singer has enlisted a tight-knit crew of compatriots who share his resolve to chart a new direction. Many in his inner circle also share his faith, ascribing to the beliefs of Churchome, a nondenominational Christian community with an outpost in Beverly Hills that is run by 44-year-old pastor Judah Smith, who also serves as a spiritual adviser to Bieber. In recent months, Bieber has been giving glimpses into his new life on social media, but whereas usually what someone presents on Instagram is the best version of themselves — the most flattering angle, an idyllic backdrop, just the right filter and, of course, the caption conveying a life lived to its fullest — some of Bieber’s posts have been more cryptic. “I think I hate myself sometimes when I feel myself start to become inauthentic. Then I remember we’re all being made to think we’re not enough but I still hate when I change myself to please people,” Bieber shared with his 294 million Instagram followers on March 22. That same day, he wrote, “I got anger issues, too,” adding that he wanted to “grow and not react so much.” In other posts, Bieber shared feeling “unworthy,” like he’s “drowning and unsafe.” Further down the scroll are visuals of a hollow-eyed Bieber brazenly smoking a blunt and rapping about getting high. Recent photos of Bieber out and about show him looking gaunt and disappearing into his clothes. Off social media, he’s also displayed some questionable behavior. At the Super Bowl, Bieber was seen dancing atop a VIP suite sofa shirtless and barefoot, bewildering nearby spectators. And just last week, Bieber had a testy exchange outside a Palm Springs coffee shop, chastising a group of paparazzi: “All you care about is money, not human beings.” For an artist whose music has lived under such hopeful banners as Purpose (the name of his fourth album) and Never Say Never (the title of his Jon Chu-directed 2011 documentary), the contrast was noticeably jarring for fans and casual observers alike (YouTube houses dozens of user-generated “What’s Going on With Justin Bieber?” commentary videos). The prevailing sentiment is that he is struggling. (Bieber’s reps refute this characterization.) Concern for Bieber’s well-being turned into a full-on public discourse when, in January, he unfollowed a number of his former friends and associates — including Braun and deputy Allison Kaye (who, after running point on all things Bieber for the better part of two decades, resigned in January), Good (who was the best man at his wedding) and longtime security chief Kenny Hamilton (who shielded him from music industry vultures, bad actors and others, like accused sex trafficker Diddy, according to multiple people present at the time), among others.Now, former friends and ex-associates excised from his world, along with musical collaborators, his record company and, of course, his fans, are coming to terms with a new chapter in the book of Bieber. And some are questioning the choices he’s making. “Whatever he’s going through, I pray for him and hope he’s OK,” says former Bieber collaborator Poo Bear, who co-wrote some of his biggest hits, including Billboard No. 1s “Despacito,” “I’m the One,” “Where Are Ü Now” and “What Do You Mean?” “Seeing him disintegrate like this … it’s watching the embodiment of someone not living their purpose,” says one ex team member. “He’s lost. There’s no one protecting him because there’s no one there willing to say no to him. You say no, you get blown out.” Mario Lavandeira, better known as Perez Hilton, who has been obsessively following Bieber’s every post, posits to The Hollywood Reporter, “Justin Bieber is like a male Britney Spears: He’s trolling, partly because he wants attention, and also because he thinks he’s so funny.” (In an April 10 Instagram story, Bieber joked of Stevie Wonder, “This fool never sees my FaceTimes.”) To that end, a source close to the singer offers that Bieber is just doing as media-savvy pop stars do. “Artists are artists — they don’t look at the world the way you and I do,” says the insider, who laughs off the notion that Bieber is in distress. “He’s healthier than all of us — physically and mentally.” “He’s managing himself through his own family office now, and there’s skepticism on if he can do it alone,” says Chris Anokute, a veteran music executive who’s worked extensively with Katy Perry. “He’s leaving home for the first time. He’s building a business without the team that took him here. I’m sure he’s feeling that pressure. But he can [do it]. At the end of the day, Justin Bieber is a star, and consumers still want Justin Bieber. … He’s showing a lot of courage and foresight on what the industry is going to look like in the future.” *** Although Bieber long ago shed his teen heartthrob image, trading his staple swoop hair for a buzz cut and covering his body in tattoos, his carefully curated ascent has always given a sense of wholesomeness. Despite his ink, which includes a cross on his chest, an image of Christ on his leg, scriptures on his arm and the name Jesus in Hebrew on his rib cage, he was never a purity ring guy, à la the Jonas Brothers. But starting out at age 15, when legions of very young fans anointed him a role model, Bieber has been leaning into this good-guy ethos, carefully guided by his former management team, led by Braun (who declined to speak for this story), which heavily promoted Bieber’s philanthropy as part of his image (via Make-A-Wish, where he’s been among the most requested celebrities for many years running, and by donating a dollar of each concert ticket sold to a charity). After all, what kid plucked from obscurity and handed fame and fortune wouldn’t feel grateful to those who cheered him on? Still, there’s a feeling that his former managers may have “protected him too much,” to the detriment of his personal growth as a kid learning from his mistakes, several ex team members share. There had been instances of questionable behavior in the past; in his younger days, Bieber had a number of police altercations, including a 2014 arrest for DUI in Miami and a vandalism charge in Calabasas that same year. But Braun’s team was always there to smooth the young star’s path, in ways big and small, swooping in to delete embarrassing tweets and videos when necessary.“He never felt the consequence of his actions because we were so worried about the illusion of Justin Bieber being ruined,” offers an insider. “It wouldn’t have ended his career. He would have felt the sting, though.” In their efforts to keep the artist happy, there was finger-pointing when things didn’t go Bieber’s way, sources reveal, especially concerning matters like budgets. Discussions about complicated music matters like song splits or creative decisions on ancillary projects could get tense, and Bieber, says a confidant, “doesn’t like conflict or drama.” At the same time, Bieber wants to give of himself. “Justin is an exceptionally generous person,” adds the insider. “He doesn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or get into arguments.” In fact, Bieber long ago instituted a team-wide directive: No talk of business after 6 p.m. Running the show as of fall 2022 is Will Bracey, a former tour manager for Fifth Harmony whose title is Chief Operating Officer at “The Office of Mr. Justin Bieber,” according to his email signature. The press-averse Bracey, who declined to speak for this article, is described as a sort of consigliere to Bieber by several people who’ve interacted with him. “He’s running the logistics and operations in service of the family,” says one source, who distinguishes Bracey as “operating at a very high level” but also describes him as not a typical music biz bro. Adds the insider: “He’s diligent and hardworking. He cares about Justin as a person.” Another describes Bracey, who is engaged to Fifth Harmony alum Ally Brooke, as “obsessive” about Bieber. “He’s protective of people knowing about his closeness with Justin, but then he’s always talking about Justin and about ‘being at his service,’ ” adds the source. Bracey worked under Braun on Bieber’s ill-fated Justice world tour in 2022, which was plagued from the get-go. The pandemic delayed its start by nearly two years, and four months after it finally kicked off in February, Bieber was diagnosed with a rare facial paralysis disease called Type 2 Ramsay Hunt syndrome and had to take several weeks off. By September, after completing around 45 concert dates, he pulled the plug on the rest of the Justice outing — a year’s worth of shows in the Far East, South America, Australasia, the Middle East and Europe. Sources say that his management — Braun and Kaye at the time — advised against canceling, noting that the tour’s routing, which was designed to include off days and buffers like weeklong breaks (during which the Biebers could work in luxe vacations), was the lightest lift possible. But Bieber wanted to get off the road to be with Hailey, according to people privy to his decision-making at the time. That meant forgoing the estimated $90 million he would have netted from the tour and laying off more than 100 crewmembers (many still recovering from the work stoppage of COVID). God’s got his back, Bieber intimated of his decision, say multiple people involved with the tour. “Can’t argue with God,” his handlers conceded. In September 2022, Bieber announced: “This past weekend, I … gave everything I have to the people in Brazil. After getting off the stage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I’m going to take a break from touring for the time being. I’m going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better.” The decision to “pull down” the remaining Justice dates brought Bieber’s mental health to the forefront. Though his struggles with substance abuse (from which he recovered) were well documented — revealed in painful detail via Bieber’s 2020 10-part YouTube Originals docuseries, Seasons — the public pronouncement of exhaustion had fans expressing worry and the industry wondering whether he’s fit for the grueling demands of touring. The Justice cancellation also triggered a series of financial consequences that are still plaguing the artist today. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour’s promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, he was left owing a large debt to AEG (insiders claim more than $20 million). According to sources, then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. To date, Bieber has only returned a portion of what he borrowed. While one might think that Bieber, who sat at the top of the pop heap for the better part of the 2010s, would be flush with cash, multiple insiders, who until recently were familiar with his finances, suggest he’s overstretched — real estate purchases and renovations (he owns six homes, including a $26 million estate in Beverly Hills’ exclusive Beverly Park neighborhood, a $16 million home in La Quinta, and a property in the tony Gozzer Ranch Golf and Lake Club in Idaho, where the Kardashian-Jenners are known to holiday) and destination vacations with friends are particularly taxing — even on the heels of a $200 million deal for the publishing rights to his catalog, executed in January 2023. (Bieber’s reps vigorously deny the assertion, telling THR, “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn’t understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.”) The sale of some 290 songs, his entire pre-2021 catalog, to Hipgnosis Songs — among them Bieber’s portion of writing credits on “Sorry,” “Holy” and “Ghost” — was seen as a major win for an artist who was only 29 at the time. That is especially true given that Bieber has relied on collaborators for his biggest hits, splitting rights with as many as 11 people on 2021’s “Peaches” (which also holds the distinction of setting a Grammy record for the most songwriters on a song of the year nomination). Though his publishing share was enough to draw a steady stream of “mailbox money,” as royalties are known colloquially — to the tune of millions in annual earnings — sources say Bieber was keen on selling, trading those regular payments for a lump sum. The publishing assets were appraised at a value of $140 million at the time, but Bieber’s team, which then included Braun, attorney Michael Rhodes and business manager Lou Taylor, was able to get the price up by $60 million. The deal was geared toward putting Bieber in a position of financial security that would last him for quite some time — one person describes it as “the largest nest egg in music history” for what is ostensibly fractions of a song — and it may be one of the last catalog sales to command a price north of $200 million. Late rapper Biggie Smalls’ songs, which include some of the most sampled beats and melodies in hip-hop, went for half that amount when Primary Wave purchased his publishing and publicity rights in March. Before the catalog gold rush, which opened the door to monster deals like Bruce Springsteen’s $500 million sale of his recordings and publishing to Sony Music in 2021, “these asset sales were normally distressed sellers — people that had tax problems, divorces, or got to a point in their age where their health was failing them and limiting other income streams such as live [shows],” explains Hipgnosis founder Merck Mercuriadis, who helped propel the “song management” market and worked on the Bieber deal. “Making millions of dollars a year versus somewhere around 15 times that amount up front is not the same freedom. With the money up front, you’re free to plan in a way where you don’t have to be beholden to anyone else. You don’t necessarily have to go on tour or make another record, if that’s not how you want to spend the next few years. You can then afford to take some risks on yourself. … For Justin, I think that was the motivation: He had ill health and was at a time in his life where he was married and very in love and contemplating family. Making the deal gave him the freedom to focus on that and not have to be on the treadmill he’d been on for almost 15 years.” “I think it was smart,” says Anokute of the sale, which valued Bieber’s share of each song at around $600,000. “With AI, I don’t know what the value of a catalog will be in the future. Anyone frowning at making a quarter-billion dollars on music that you made before the age of 30 is a fool. He sold that music, and he has another 10 to 20 years ahead of him where he could own everything.” (It’s worth noting that Hailey Bieber is herself a successful model and entrepreneur who launched her own skin-care line, Rhode — her middle name — in 2022, and is reportedly exploring a sale.) Smart or not, the deal also opened a rift between Bieber and Braun, with the former said to be resentful of the latter’s ballooning wealth. In fact, the tension had been building for some time. Although widely credited with launching Bieber’s career as a teen phenom (with the backing of Usher), Braun’s Svengali-like guidance drew some ire from the general public, and even more so in recent years as struggles unique to child stars have been exposed in the media. Bieber himself made reference to the pressures on young performers in a teary interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2020. Speaking of Billie Eilish, who was then 18, Bieber said, “I just want to protect her,” adding, “It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn, and everyone telling me they loved me, and turning their back on you in a second.” There’s little doubt that Braun is a savvy mogul. He was an early investor in Spotify, Uber and Waze, all the while guiding the careers of artists across the musical spectrum, from Ariana Grande to J Balvin to Demi Lovato. But with Bieber, Braun accomplished something truly rare in the music industry: growing a pop career into adulthood with a string of hit singles, two documentaries and 23 Grammy nominations (and two wins). Today, Bieber ranks among the five most-followed celebrities in social media (alongside Swift, Grande and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez). But as Braun’s own stature in the entertainment industry was rising, with TV and film projects added to his portfolio (as an executive producer on the hit series Dave and the Balvin documentary The Boy From Medellín, and a partner with Marvel founding chairman David Maisel in Mythos Studios), he’s also stumbled into some PR snafus of his own, like his feud with Swift over the ownership of her catalog, which Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased in 2019 in a deal for Swift’s Nashville-based label, Big Machine, for a reported $300 million. In the minds of millions of Swifties, Braun was the greedy bad guy who had “bullied” the singer out of the chance of owning her own music. (Both parties ultimately came out ahead. A year and change after purchasing the Swift catalog, Braun sold those rights to a private equity firm for a reported $405 million, a profit of over $250 million. For her part, Swift resolved — and delivered— to rerecord and re-release her earlier albums with the amended title “Taylor’s Version.” Her reenergized base prompted monster streaming numbers on the rerecords, which fed appetite for new material and launched the record-shattering Eras tour.) The succession of prescient and profitable moves brought Braun to the attention of South Korean entertainment giant Hybe, which in 2021 acquired Ithaca Holdings in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. As part of the sale, longtime staffers were given a total of $50 million in stock from Braun’s personal stake. Bieber and Grande were each gifted $10 million, per public filings. Bieber’s contract with Braun would now move over to Hybe America, for which Braun serves as CEO. In June 2024, Braun announced that he was leaving artist management, writing of Bieber and Grande: “To see them both come up to be the legends they are today will forever be one of my greatest honors. As we change our working relationships now, I will continue to root for them with the same passion that I did at each of their humble beginnings.” But Braun is still bearing the brunt of criticism for participating in contracts that the public perceives as taking advantage of young artists — specifically in the realm of rights and ownership. “It’s easy to villainize Scooter,” says one high-ranking music executive familiar with all the parties, reasoning that Braun was already viewed negatively due to the dust-up with Swift. “He’s not Lou Pearlman; he’s the modern-day David Geffen. No trickery or shenanigans. You could make a plan and get things done with Scooter. And you could always make money with him.” Another longtime Braun associate echoes that view: “Actions speak louder than words, and Scooter put his money where his mouth is. He built a profitable business and made [Justin] a billion dollars.” *** One figure who has seemingly benefited from an association with Bieber, and remained in the star’s inner orbit, is his longtime pastor Judah Smith. He’s seen his Churchome community grow steadily in the past decade, now reportedly drawing more than 10,000 parishioners weekly, among its five locations. Its Beverly Hills visitors have included Kourtney Kardashian, Ciara and Russell Wilson. Bieber regularly attends Churchome sermons on Zoom, in addition to appearing in person with Hailey. In 2019, he helped lead a service, noting in a clip leaked to TMZ that he hadn’t done so before because “I didn’t want people to think this was a show.” “He’s got the biggest heart in the whole world, he forgives very easily, [and] he believes the best very readily,” the pastor once told The Daily Beast of his star disciple. “[We] talk all the time and pray a lot and think a lot together.” (The pair also have gotten matching tattoos together while on tour.) “Judah and his wife are great people,” says one congregant of Churchome, which is relatively permissive in its social ethos along the evangelical continuum, preferring hopeful messaging about scripture to Jim Bakker-like fearmongering. This accepting ideology is attractive to parishioners in its big, coastal cities with more liberal social views and values. Smith has pursued his own Hollywood projects. In 2017, Amazon reportedly shot an unaired talk show pilot, produced by Management 360’s production arm, which would have seen him in conversation with famous figures about life’s biggest questions. He incorporated a new entity, Pitiful Palace, in March 2024, which according to public records intends to focus on faith-based multimedia entertainment. Both Bieber and Smith, who sits on the board of one of the singer’s companies, were longtime clients at Lou Taylor’s business management firm Tri Star. They both appear to have left in spring 2024, shortly after Tri Star — which had already been embroiled in Britney Spears’ conservatorship dispute — began to publicly figure into Diddy’s legal saga. Taylor, herself the wife of a pastor, also exited the Churchome board. (She declined to comment.) As an adviser on records or tours, Smith obviously has none of Braun’s chops, but the two men do share some common traits. Both are deeply committed to their respective faiths (Braun, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, is Jewish and helped bring the Nova Music Festival exhibit, honoring the hundreds killed by terrorists in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to the U.S.); charismatic in private meetings and public speaking engagements; and each has an intuition for popular culture. But where one is fluent in the language of entertainment, the other now seated at the table is a novice in an industry that’s fraught with shady practices and constant change. “You have a narcissistic pastor egging on a narcissistic artist, both fueled by Jesus, running around trying to do business,” says someone familiar with Smith and Bieber. Another affirms the tremendous sway and influence Smith has over Bieber when it comes to major career and life decisions. *** And when the business is music, things get even more complicated. The industry is built on supporting album cycles — it may take a year to record and produce an hour’s worth of songs, during which time the team is planning a tour, branding deals, merchandise and all manner of creative related to the project. That means working at least two years out on a global plan and committing the artist for two years post-release. In Bieber’s case, the absence of an album cycle makes tapping large sums of money more challenging. And since Bieber sold off his publishing, smart financial planning is key to this new phase, when automatically generated income is diminished. Bieber’s first record deal with Raymond Braun Music Group (RBMG), signed in 2008 and likely renegotiated, entitled the company then jointly owned by Braun and Usher (the latter sold his interest in RBMG in 2022 for an estimated $40 million) to share in the profits of Bieber’s album and song streams and additional revenue sources related to the recordings. In 2020, Bieber’s RBMG contract came to an end and he signed a new recording deal, where he and Braun partnered on a label (of which Bieber is a majority shareholder) that calls for four more albums via label partner Def Jam Records (a subsidiary of Universal Music Group), but since 2021’s Justice, Bieber has only released guest appearances on tracks by Don Toliver and SZA. Insiders assert that Tunji Balogun, who joined Def Jam as CEO in 2022 after a decade at RCA Records working with the likes of Bryson Tiller, Childish Gambino, Khalid and Wizkid, doesn’t have a relationship with Bieber, and his efforts go only so far. (Universal Music Group did not respond to requests for comment.) “He’ll release music when he feels comfortable,” says a confidant of Bieber. Meanwhile, Bieber has been hosting “jam sessions” at his house where attendees have included his longtime DJ Tay James, musical director HARV, SZA collaborator Carter Lang and Australian artist Eddie Benjamin (whose song “Maniac” soundtracks the Skylrk visual). Staffers at Universal Music universally agree: They would love to have a new Bieber album, as the demand for Bieber’s return remains strong. But things may be complicated for the label “until Justin and Scooter sort out their issues,” says one company insider. Often, when a manager and a longtime client break, there’s a “sunset” period in which commissions are still being collected on deals negotiated prior to the split. Such extrication from a years-long relationship can be awkward, and in the case of Bieber and Braun, it most certainly is. According to multiple players, Bieber is pushing to renegotiate his recording contract in order to lessen Braun’s share in his future music. So far, they remain at an impasse. “There’s a hole right now,” says Anokute. “A lot of the leading artists are female … and the male artists aren’t your traditional pop stars: It’s Benson Boone, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey. The marketplace is in desperate need of the music Justin Bieber has given us over the years. We’re welcoming him in with open arms.” Indeed, a music agent familiar with the numbers says Bieber is “still demanding seven to eight figures” but doesn’t see him touring anytime soon. “An occasional pop-up show, maybe,” the agent hints. So where does this leave Justin Bieber? Is he satisfied with the life-work balance he’s chosen? What will it take to come back, and will the fans, now also in their 30s, show up? “He’s meant to be onstage,” says a former adviser. “Like his brain needs that dopamine release and he’s not getting it. But at what point does it become Timberlake? No one wants to see a bunch of 30-year-olds out there dancing. It becomes nostalgic.” His current team is of another mind, and while no one from the “Bieber Family Office” would speak on the record, the sentiment seems to be, hasn’t he given enough? Anokute concurs: ”He’s been a winner for 16 years. Everyone goes through stuff; people have struggles financially, relationship problems. Do you know what it’s like to be a man at 30? To be a father? He’s living his life. Let him evolve. Let him grow. He’s gone through the fire and this is a phoenix moment for him. He’s going to rise.” Ethan Millman and Gary Baum contributed to this report.

Title: Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year

Time Published: 2025-04-16T16:14:12Z

Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year. One thing after another seems to be knocking shares lower. If the pressure isn't coming from competing Chinese AI models, it's being applied by President Trump as he announces more tariffs on Nvidia-adjacent industries. And that's not to mention the stock's status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a headlining member of the vaunted Magnificent 7. Its rapid increase over the past few years has only been rivaled by the major declines it experiences during times of market turbulence. Nvidia's rocky year continued on Wednesday as shares fell as much as 7% after the company said that it expects to take a $5.5 billion earnings hit because of Chinese tariffs levied by Trump. The stock is now down 20% year-to-date and off about 30% from its January peak. Those losses far outpace the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 12% in 2025. Investors in Nvidia — formerly the market's foremost darling — are being forced to come to grips with the stock's position at the epicenter of multiple headwinds. "Nvidia has found itself in the middle of many crosscurrents this year," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI on Wednesday. Detailed below are three major forces holding Nvidia back in 2025: This ultimately boils down to Nvidia's sheer size and weighting in major indexes, which has resulted from the stock's eye-watering climb in recent years. Now that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the clear leader of the AI-chip revolution, expectations have been ratcheted up. After all, Nvidia has grown its annual revenue by 383% since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. "The stock has become a victim of its own success where the exponential growth following the release of ChatGPT became unsustainable given how large sales had become," Hickey said. The first warning of a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth rate was the release of a large-language model from China, named DeepSeek. DeepSeek was significant in that it utilized nuanced efficiency gains that helped boost performance on par with mainstream GPTs, all while using significantly less computing power. The swift decline in Nvidia stock was almost fully recovered in mid-February, as tech CEOs spun DeepSeek's efficiency gains as a reason why AI should evolve even quicker. But that recovery was severely dented after Nvidia reported its earnings results in late February, which included guidance that failed to meet Wall Street's most lofty projections. After earnings, tariff worries weighed on Nvidia stock, as it sources most of its chips from overseas factories, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor. And now investors have to worry about the US government levying export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market as a watered down AI GPU. All together, this weighs on Nvidia's ability to continue to post eye-popping growth rates in its upcoming earnings release. "We acknowledge that this news could impact NVDA Jul-Q guide's ability to beat street estimates comfortably," analysts at Citi said in a note on Wednesday. These issues only compounded investor worries about the stock. "The stock's problems started way before DeepSeek and tariffs, but these issues haven't helped as they only create more doubt as to the sustainability of its torrid growth rate," Hickey said. Jump to

Title: Lyft Stock Rises as Oppenheimer Initiates Coverage at 'Outperform'

Time Published: 2025-04-16T15:55:48Z
Full Content:
Oppenheimer analysts on Wednesday initiated coverage of Lyft (LYFT) with an "outperform" rating, writing that they expect the company to benefit as ridesharing continues "to challenge the rising cost of car ownership." The analysts gave Lyft a $15 price target, a premium of about 38% to the stock's closing price Tuesday. Of the 15 analysts who currently cover Lyft tracked by Visible Alpha, four—including Oppenheimer—have "buy" or equivalent ratings, 10 have "hold" ratings, and one has a "sell" rating, with a price target range of $12 to $24. Oppenheimer wrote that Lyft could benefit as younger, frequent users of its app continue to age and rely on its services as car ownership continues to get more expensive. They also said Lyft and rival Uber (UBER) should see lower costs as autonomous driving technology improves and the companies partner with self-driving vehicle makers to offer rides through their apps. Also on Wednesday, Lyft announced a 175-million-euro ($199.1 million) acquisition of FREENOW, a ridesharing service that operates in nine countries in Europe, from BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz Mobility. Lyft said the deal is set to close in the second half of this year. Shares of Lyft, which is set to report its latest quarterly results after the bell on May 8, were up about 2.2% in recent trading. They have declined roughly 40% in the past 12 months.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Title: Netflix Set To Kick Off Earnings Season Well Positioned As Wall Street Weighs Recession Risk
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/04/netflix-q1-2025-earnings-tariffs-wall-street-media-1236368789/
Time Published: 2025-04-16T14:33:11Z
Full Content:
By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Netflix unveils its first-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The report will kick off a rather momentous earnings season for media amid churning stock markets and recession jitters prompted by the Trump administration’s global tariffs. Traditionally the company that fires the starting gun for entertainment and tech numbers every three months, Netflix may be a calming place to start this time. As tariffs cast a pall across business sectors including media, the streaming giant may be Wall Street‘s top stock pick to weather the macroeconomic storm. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein calls it the “cleanest story” in media in the case of a U.S. or global recession. The company has little tariff exposure, sustainable 2025 growth, strong engagement data and has gotten to the other side of a round of price increases, which bug customers but enthuse profit-hungry investors. This will be the first quarter when Netflix doesn’t report subscriber numbers, but it has a number of other metrics to trumpet and has been solidly profitable for years, a claim most other streaming players can’t yet make. Watch on Deadline Netflix is only minimally exposed to advertising, which right now is ideal, after introducing a cheaper ad tier less than three years ago. A nascent business is less exposed as low consumer confidence, anticipated inflation and economic uncertainty have Wall Streeters warning of an advertising pullback. Advertising makes up a big chunk of revenue and profit at companies like Fox Corp., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery to Meta and Snap. The ad business was hit hard during the past two recessions and slow to recover, which left leaving the media landscape transformed. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” research firm MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent client note. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation towards connected TV and broader digital channels.” He see $45 billion in lost U.S. advertising spend versus current forecasts if GDP growth slows in 2025. To limit downside risk, the firm’s Michael Nathanson pinpoints Netflix and Alphabet as “offering compelling entry points.” The firm has “buy” recommendations on both, as well as on Disney, WBD and Meta. It has “hold” ratings on Fox, Paramount, Roku and Snap. But it also said it’s waiting to revise forecasts ahead of “further clarity during earnings calls.” It’s an understatement to say that CEO commentary over the next few weeks is highly anticipated. Beyond advertising, analysts fret about parks, which generate key revenue at Disney and Comcast, with the latter’s NBCUniversal division set to open Epic Universe in May. Nathanson notes that historical recessions (in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009) squeezed domestic parks. In the event of a recession, he predicted, Disney’s U.S. revenue would be several billion dollars below his estimates for both this year and next. Trump’s tariffs have angered U.S. allies. Airlines are sounding a cautionary note and analysts in that sector note dips in foreign travel to the U.S. in March from the year before. Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities think Epic Universe could provide a nice boost to the sector in trying times, along with new Disney cruise ships and a rise in per capital spending at Disney parks. That said, BofA has had to rethink its outlook. “Entering the year, we were bullish on the Media & Entertainment industry in part driven by a potential cycle of M&A, but this thesis has clearly not played out (and appears unlikely) given the current Administration’s unfavorable view of some companies in our coverage,” Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients. Media and entertainment, in a state of seemingly never-ending tumult, navigating Covid and then Hollywood talent strikes over the past few years, “now faces the economic uncertainty and market volatility created by the risk of tariffs.” BofA economists are not forecasting a recession but see a drag on growth that could bring the economy to the precipice. “While typical recession risk mainly impacts revenue, tariffs could lead to higher costs,” the analyst noted, in areas like raw materials for sets, or a loss of foreign tax incentives for production. She sees Netflix and Spotify as best-positioned in the field and preferred buys as both have nascent ad businesses and strong subscription models with “critical entertainment which historically performs well in a recession.” Oppenheimer’s Helfstein says that Netflix could be confronted with higher churn, weaker gross subscriber additions or subscribers trading down to cheaper plans given the deteriorating economic picture. Still, he says the firm sees “limited risk overall.” Citing a 2011 Stanford survey, he said consumers spend more time at home during economic hardship, and time spent watching TV increased during the last U.S. recession. (And we all remember the explosion of viewing and sign-ups in 2020.) Netflix is offering both secular growth, as it embarks on a new advertising revenue strategy among selective price increases, says David Joyce of Seaport Research, calling it “the best of both worlds as the low price points globally offer a great deal of value for the engagement levels – which is exhibited in good times and bad.” Generally, what makes Netflix and other streamers a “defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it’s likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget.” A monthly premium subscription is cheaper than a sporting event, a concert and even an Imax ticket. Although exhibitors also tend to benefit in economic downturns. He has a buy on the stock. The first quarter brought one of the company’s biggest hits ever, Adolescence, showing continued momentum after it blew past estimates to top 303 million subscribers as of the end of 2024. Loop Capital’s Alan Gould said the Ted Sarandos- and Greg Peters-led streamer should be among the most economically resilient companies in the current climate and least impacted by tariffs. For the first three months of 2025, Gould is forecasting $10.54 billion in revenue; operating income of $3 billion; net income of $2.456 billion; and diluted earnings per share of $5.63. Wall Street consensus is close at $10.51 billion of revenue; just under $3 billion in operating income; $2.473 million net profit; and EPS of $5.67, he noted, as per investment researcher VisibleAlpha. “Both we and the Street and us are expecting a small revenue, operating income and EPS beat. The quarter will benefit from about a half quarter of the price increase in the UCAN region and a month in the UK. As discussed in our March 24 report, here, engagement appears to have been up 5% for the quarter based on NFLX’s weekly Top 10 global titles in English, non-English, film and series,” Gould said in a report yesterday. “Engagement was down for the 4 weeks from late February to mid-March, coinciding with 1 month after the US price increase was fully in effect, but engagement has since bounced back the past 3 weeks.” Any and all financial metrics will be taking on increased significance when company reports after market close Thursday because – and this is big – it will be the first quarter ever Netflix won’t be revealing monthly subscriber numbers. That prospect freaked out analysts when it was floated last year although some say it has the benefit of tamping down some of the volatility around the stock, which can get buffeted subscriber numbers from quarter to quarter. Netflix has said that it will still provide that data in certain situations, like when it hits milestones. It also will likely continue characterizing growth in its ad-supported tier, using montly active users (MAUs) as the key metric, which is different from subscribers. Upbeat sentiment on the streamer accelerated this week after a WSJ report that the company’s top brass shared some ambitious goals at an annual business review with senior staff – namely, plans to achieve a $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue by 2030. The outlook included growth targets for ad sales – of $9 billion globally by 2030, and tripling operating income from $10 billion in 2024. The saga of tariffs – imposed under a Trump declared “national emergency” in foreign trade – has been fast-moving, hard to follow and value-destroying. On April 2, the administration announced sweeping tariffs targeting 60 countries with a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all remaining imports that had not been taxed already, calling it Liberation Day. Trump then announced hefty, additional reciprocal tariffs on most countries, tanking markets. He later walked those back to allow for negotiations. When China publicly chastised the administration, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. China quickly confirmed will cut back imports of Hollywood films, which could impact media company revenue. Last Friday, Trump suspended tariffs on electronics like iPhone and laptops from China – where most are made. But the administration also said it’s probing the “whole” tech supply chain, meaning products like chips and semiconductors may not be excluded from tariffs. He also has hinted yesterday that he might give tariff relief to certain automakers to give them more time to move production the U.S. Relief also might also extend to car components. Tariffs on a major trading partner, the European Union, will likely stay in place as negotiations appear to have stalled, according to a number of developments on Tuesday. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been putting out sometimes twice-daily updates on the tariff situation in recent weeks, said Tuesday that “the price impacts from this head-scratching tariff slate could result in demand destruction of 15%-20%” for new car purchases in the U.S. this year. That would add $100 million to automakers’ costs and raise the price of new cars by up to $15K. Automakers are a key advertising category. Trump’s goal is to move production back to the U.S., but that would take years after decades of globalization. “We reiterate the concept of a U.S. made car with all U.S. parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative” and not even possible now, Ives wrote. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson has also been among those pointing out that a shift by Apple from China-based iPhone production to American manufacturing for the device, which accounts for half of the tech giant’s revenue, would take decades. Given the uncertainty, companies are unlikely to commit capital based on protectionist policies that may not last beyond 2028, Nathanson said. Entertainment, unlike auto parts or lumber or liquor or shoes, is a service, not a good, so not subject to tariffs. Of the more than 300 CEOs surveyed in April by an industry group called Chief Executive that conducts monthly polls, 62% saw a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months – up from 48% who had that forecast in March. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during a recent interview that the U.S. may already be in a recession or getting close to one due to Trump’s tariffs. The tariff debate escalated as banks were out with quarterly numbers, the first sector to report each earnings season. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday the prospect of a recession has increased amid the uncertainties of a trade war alongside growing indications that economic global economic activity is slowing. Influential JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also said tariffs could spur inflation, weaker economic growth and, potentially, a recession. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026.

Title: Nvidia stock slumps 6% as a U.S. ban on China AI exports means a $5.5 billion hit

Time Published: 2025-04-16T14:26:00Z

The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty. Nvidia (NVDA), America’s third-largest company by market cap, said Wednesday it will take a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China — citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The H20 had been engineered to comply with earlier Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China, one that was quickly gaining traction. But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing. Let’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched. Meanwhile, ASML (ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026. Investors didn’t like what they saw. Nvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry. In a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks. Markets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Activate your online access Authoritarian regimes make crushing unions a top priority for a reason: Strong, independent unions are the best safeguard against tyranny. Dozens of Starbucks employees and union supporters protested alleged anti-union tactics by the company outside a Kansas City Starbucks on March 3, 2022. It’s easy to feel powerless. The US government is enabling Israel’s genocide in Palestine and deporting immigrants to concentration camps in El Salvador. Elon Musk is gutting public services. And corporations, emboldened by the new regime, are urging it to go even further and roll back workers’ rights and public accountability. These forces can feel “too big to fail,” which raises the question: How can we meaningfully fight these powerful actors? If you want to fight the rise of fascism, organize a union in your workplace—or get a job and help your coworkers organize. There’s a reason that authoritarian regimes often make crushing unions their top priority: Free and independent unions are the best safeguard of democracy. Unionizing provides workers with the means of building power outside of capital and the state. A strong labor movement could launch a general strike in protest of a repressive regime that would shut down the economy and force concessions—or at least galvanize resistance and turn popular opinion against the state, as the 1943 strike at the Fiat factory in Mirafiori, Italy, which helped bring down Benito Mussolini’s dictatorship, demonstrated. The threat of a general strike has not lost its power: In 2019, during the first Trump administration, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, helped end a government shutdown by calling for one. After flights were grounded in New York City, politicians reached a deal to reopen the government within hours. Unionizing also allows workers to leverage their power to resist state and corporate demands, while protecting workers from retaliation when they speak out against injustice—both within and outside the workplace. In a heroic example of unionized workers refusing work to protect human rights, workers at a Scottish Rolls Royce plant in 1973 refused to repair engines used by the Chilean dictatorship. Their union had already issued statements condemning the junta and its torture and murder of their fellow trade unionists; this was a means of putting their beliefs into action and helping to save lives. As the US government persecutes marginalized groups and as corporations respond by dropping their pretext of caring about social justice and ending their diversity, inclusion, and equity programs, US unions must likewise become or remain a means of collective advocacy. Rank-and-file organizing within Starbucks Workers United, the union campaign I helped launch in 2021, has meant that the union has spoken out on a range of issues—from LGBTQ rights to racial justice to solidarity with Palestine. Through actions like “Strike with Pride”—a national strike over the company’s cuts to coverage of gender-affirming care, retaliation against queer organizers, and removal of pride decorations from cafes—the Starbucks union is mobilizing within the labor movement to make these demands over human rights mainstream. Even where workers do not already have left-wing sympathies, a strong and independent labor movement can change its members’ beliefs and make authoritarianism less appealing. Right-wing populism recognizes that workers are angry, but instead of channeling that anger upward, toward the corporate bosses and their collaborators, its survival relies on directing resentment downward, toward immigrants, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized groups. Union-busting often follows this same template, as corporations try to prevent workers from building solidarity with each other and instead stoke divisions within the workforce. Union organizing unites people around class, helping to build genuine community and solidarity between groups the ruling class seeks to pit against each other. Through shared struggle, workers who might otherwise have been attracted to right-wing populism often develop a deeper understanding of the ways their own interest is entwined with their coworkers’—including the coworkers who belong to groups that might be painted as “the enemy.” A 2019 study indicated that even where white working-class voters had “psychological tendencies” toward authoritarianism, involvement in unions frequently “inoculated” them against voting for Trump. But the impact of unionization on members’ outlook goes far beyond the ballot box: Authoritarian regimes rely on the public looking the other way from injustice (or cheering it on), while the labor movement emphasizes that an injury to one is an injury to all and urges collective action to confront abuse. If unions are our best hope to reverse course, what should the labor movement prepare for as authoritarians take power in the United States? The playbook for undermining or outlawing independent unions has several components, including attempting to co-opt unions, restricting or eliminating existing unions, and creating loyal or company unions to create a semblance of worker voice without giving workers real power. Co-opting existing unions is one of the most straightforward strategies, targeting existing fault lines within the labor movement, but its scale is limited since it relies largely on the consent of the co-opted. In India, for example, unions are typically linked to political parties; thus, the RSS, a far-right nationalist paramilitary organization, has both a political wing—Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—and a labor wing. In other countries, unions that were initially independent have since aligned with right-wing political groups: Poland’s Solidarność evolved from an independent union formed during an illegal wildcat strike against authoritarian state socialism into a supporter of the reactionary Law and Justice party. Right-wing tendencies have always existed within the US labor movement. Most early unions, even tho se that organized Black and white workers into interracial locals, supported the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. As government repression targeted leftist and anti-war unions in the beginning of the 20th century, many unions adopted increasingly conservative platforms, culminating in purges of Communist organizers from the labor movement at the height of the red scare. The Teamsters endorsed Nixon in 1972 and Reagan in 1980. Is their president’s current coziness with Trump—Sean O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention last year; while the union declined to endorse a candidate, it released polling data indicating that members largely supported Trump—a true departure from their past? Not necessarily, but it is a concerning sign—especially when workers at companies ranging from Chipotle to Amazon are seeking to join the Teamsters as part of a commitment to joining the labor movement and building a better world. O’Brien’s right-wing turn also included tweeting his approval of Senator Josh Hawley’s anti-DEI and anti-trans op-ed, “The Promise of Pro-Labor Conservatism.” Unions must resist the temptation to accept a “pro-labor conservatism” rooted in macho, white-supremacist nationalism. The United Auto Workers has recently pivoted from declaring “Trump is a scab” during the election season to writing “We’re ready to work with Trump” in the pages of The Washington Post. Even if the UAW thinks its members will benefit from Trump’s erratic tariffs—which has put the UAW at odds with the Canadian autoworkers’ union and has already resulted in layoffs of UAW members at some domestic auto plants—making a bargain with this administration is a fundamentally unwise decision. Any wins gained through such compromises would come at the cost of the UAW’s moral compass and labor movement solidarity: the very things that make a union a powerful force for justice. Where authoritarians are unable to co-opt unions, they frequently restrict their ability to operate, criminalizing many actions, targeting union leaders, and changing labor law to make organizing much harder. In Turkey, for example, Erdoğan’s regime has made an already-challenging climate for organizing even more repressive. The state has suppressed strikes, arrested union leaders, and used the state of emergency it declared in 2016 after a failed coup attempt to fire about 130,000 public-sector workers, claiming they were disloyal to the government. Emma Jackson Jeet Heer Saree Makdisi Books & the Arts / Mark Chiusano Sound familiar? Trump’s recent attacks on federal workers’ unions—including his executive order stripping most federal workers of their right to organize—follow the same playbook. This attempt to ban unions within a wide range of government agencies on “national security” pretexts doesn’t even try to hide its retaliatory intent of preventing “hostile unions” (as the administration’s lawsuit refers to many federal unions) from acting as a countervailing force through collective bargaining. The Trump administration has further targeted union organizers and members across sectors based on their immigration status, including sheet-metal worker Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a member of SMART, who was abducted and taken to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison due to a so-called “administrative error” that the Trump administration has refused to reverse, in defiance of judicial orders. ICE is also known to have kidnapped a United Farm Workers leader, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez; revoked the work authorizations of 200 unionized manufacturing workers in Kentucky who are members of the IUE-CWA; abducted unionized graduate students, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil; seized SEIU member Lewelyn Dixon, a University of Washington lab tech; and raided a roofing company where workers had protested safety conditions, disappearing 37 workers whose families do not know their whereabouts. Finally, the Trump administration has signaled its intention to repeal Section 8(a)2 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which bans company unions—organizations that are dominated or controlled by the boss, often with the intention of preventing free and independent unions from gaining traction instead. In between assertions about the “Judeo-Christian tradition, stretching back to Genesis, recogniz[ing] fruitful work as integral to human dignity [and] as service to God” and policy proposals to ban critical race theory trainings, encourage “Sabbath rest,” and reduce overtime pay thresholds, the labor section of Project 2025 lays out a plan to facilitate the creation of works councils and other forms of what it calls “non-union worker voice and representation.” Before the passage of the NLRA in 1935, many businesses created company unions. After using the National Guard to massacre striking coal miners in an encampment in Ludlow, Colorado, in 1914 (burning 11 children alive), John D. Rockefeller Jr., embarked on an effort to restore his reputation through a public relations campaign that included an “employee representation plan” under his control. Company unions ran rampant in industries ranging from steel to textiles to railways to photography. The NLRA’s prohibition was designed to put an end to this practice to help remove barriers to workers organizing freely. Today, advocates of “associational” or “alternative” unionization, like labor scholar Tom Kochan (who remains a staunch supporter of collective bargaining, as well), argue that because union density is so low, “labor law needs to open up to support a range of voice options.” For very different reasons, some of the Project 2025 authors, including Oren Cass, share this view: Cass has maintained that the Republican Party should be more open to unions (within a narrower definition of what “protected concerted activity” entails) and has advocated for workers’ councils and placing workers on corporate boards. While these alternatives may give workers more voice—i.e., a forum to express opinions—they don’t provide workers real power—the ability to bargain about issues and build an independent organization. Moreover, rather than helping open the door to forming a real union, they often make it more difficult to organize. If workers are likely to face an intense union-busting campaign and retaliation for forming an independent union, but the company is encouraging participation in an alternative model, many workers would settle for the safer but powerless option. Even during the best of times, organizing a union is not easy; labor law in the United States is extremely weak, and, as labor professor John Logan writes, corporations “are prepared to do whatever is necessary, lawful or unlawful, to crush their organizing campaigns.” But in our current moment, it is critical that workers continue to organize in order to build power independent from corporations and the state, and to insist on their unions maintaining principled positions rather than negotiating with authoritarians. Growing democracy in the workplace is our best line of defense for democracy outside of it, too. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.

Title: The FTC Discredited Its Case Against Meta In Its Opening Statement

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: The Dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible as FTC attorney Daniel ... More Matheson departs E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on April 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust trial against Meta over the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and allegations that the company holds a monopoly over the social networking market. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.” Those were the words of FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in the opening statement of the FTC’s antitrust case against Meta. Matheson unwittingly exposed his own argument as meritless. To understand why, it’s important to remember that when Facebook purchased Instagram in April of 2012, it could claim just 30 million users at a time when Facebook’s users were already in the billion category. Which is a comment that FTC and Matheson are rewriting history in an attempt to make their case. If readers are confused, consider yet again that Instagram could claim all of 30 million users when its acquisition was announced. So, while it should be said that antitrust is always and everywhere an unfortunate look backwards by government lawyers constrained by the known, it’s no wonder that the Barack Obama DOJ and FTC didn’t raise an objection to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram. The simple truth is that Instagram was largely unknown in 2012, and as an unknown, not at all a Facebook rival or peer. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the price Facebook paid for Instagram: $1 billion in cash and stock. Sorry, but such a purchase wasn’t evidence of a social media giant in Facebook buying its way out of competitive pressures, rather it was Mark Zuckerberg speculating on a future of social media that brought new meaning to opaque. In other words, if Instagram had even somewhat appeared as a future threat to Facebook or Facebook’s competition, there would have been a ferocious bidding war for Instagram that would have pushed its purchase price far, far above $1 billion. From there, consider Meta’s U.S. sales in 2025. Instagram presently accounts for 50 percent. Looking back to 2012, if Instagram had at all been seen as such a substantial future source of Facebook or Meta revenues, then the 2012 buyout price for it would once again have been far, far above $1 billion. Yet Matheson is basing his case on Facebook spending what was even then a somewhat piddling sum to ward off its oncoming status as a has-been victim of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”? Such a view isn’t serious. What is serious and dangerous at the same time is that Meta and Zuckerberg are being forced to spend precious time in court for having seen the future of social media much more clearly than their rivals. In other words, rather than rest on his wildly successful Facebook laurels, the future-seeing Zuckerberg worked feverishly to discover ways to continue to meet, and much more important, lead the needs of a social media user base that had alternate options then, and still does now. It all raises a question: since when is vastly improving the user experience with free services the stuff of antitrust violations? Tick tock, tick tock. All of which brings us back to how Matheson framed his opening statement, and most notably the case-neutering line about Facebook buying out its rivals rather than competing with them. Which means Matheson is basing his gossamer thin argument on the easy-to-discredit notion that 2012 resembled 2025 in a commercial sense. Except that it didn’t, and Meta still has its $1 billion receipt from its Instagram purchase to prove that it didn’t.

If Muse isn't creating games, then what is it creating - and how should we respond? Earlier this month, Microsoft set loose upon the world a new, publicly-available demo of its video game-focused generative AI model, Muse. As far as demos go, it was a significant one: a playable, browser-based "AI rendition" of legendary first-person shooter Quake 2. But rather than landing as, say, an impressive demonstration of Microsoft's bounding progress in artificial intelligence, the Quake 2 "Copilot gaming experience" was widely slammed by the gaming public as, amongst many other things, "shit". The criticism has been more or less universal, ranging from members of the public describing it as "absolutely fucking disgusting" and "like horrible Nyquil-induced sleep paralysis", to a Forbes "review" of the game that called it "an abomination". Members of the games press condemned reporting in The Verge, which ran the headline "Microsoft has created an AI-generated version of Quake", as overly credulous, labelling any similar coverage as "unpaid PR work". Will Smith, a tech blogger, offered a more measured response but still concluded that it is ultimately "a gimmick. It's interactive video, and yeah, I guess that's impressive, but it doesn't capture the magic of interlocking systems that still makes playing Quake 2 fun in 2025, despite the fact that it's almost 30 years old and dates to the earliest days of 3D graphics." All of this comes just a couple of weeks after Microsoft's initial reveal of Muse itself, which that time featured non-interactive but similarly murky footage based on Ninja Theory's Bleeding Edge - and which received a similarly heated response. That first unveiling also came with further issues of its own. Reactions zeroed in on the notion of Muse being used for "gameplay ideation" in particular, as well as Xbox chief Phil Spencer's seemingly outlandish claim, in an accompanying video, that Muse could "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future," making older games compatible with "any device". It was a messy reveal. At the time, we clarified - with the help of AI expert Dr Michael Cook - that Muse very much was not "creating games". As Cook laid out in his blog, the research paper Microsoft had published in Nature alongside the reveal of this model "is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," but is instead, "about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools." But that didn't mean there weren't plenty of limitations and concerns. On Spencer's comments on preservation, for instance, Cook noted: "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of Final Fantasy 8 looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort." All in all, it leads to what is on the surface an utterly bizarre situation. Microsoft, one of the world's wealthiest businesses, is committing presumably vast sums of money towards the work of its Muse AI research team. The research team features a number of experts, such as Dr Sam Devlin and research lead Dr Katja Hofmann, that are well-known and widely cited in their field. And the early results of this research are something that almost everyone in the industry seems to totally despise. There is intense scepticism towards what Muse AI does, what it could do, and whether it could ever be useful for anything. But what is actually going on? Can the research team behind it offer more credible answers? And how, exactly, ought we react to all of it? To help understand, I spoke to two of the people who have been at the heart of the conversation around Muse since its reveal: Drs Mike Cook and Katja Hofmann. Cook is a senior lecturer in computer science at King's College London and specialises in artificial intelligence, specifically computational creativity, automated game design, and design and analysis of generative software. We've covered his work on Eurogamer a few times over the years, including an AI program he built, ANGELINA, which was capable of creating video games of its own back in 2013, and his quest to see if it could win a game jam the following year. He talks with the soft directness of a fast-moving lecturer who doesn't mind if you really can't keep up with the source material, as long as you're at least willing to keep trying. Speaking to me after the first Muse reveal, but before the second featuring Quake 2, I asked Cook to explain what was going on in the Bleeding Edge examples we were first given. "I suppose you could think of it as: if you showed ChatGPT a screenshot of a video game, and then you said, "Could you show me a video of what would happen if there was an enemy here", and it generates a video showing you the player playing from that screenshot, but with an enemy on the screen," he says. That's a "very clumsy" summary, he adds, "but basically that's what they're trying to do." A key point to emphasise here is, as Cook says, that "it's generating images. It's not generating code or anything like that." It's a series of images forming a video, and that video is what's known as being "conditioned", in AI research terms. "It's conditioned on inputs," Cook explains, in the same way that an image generation tool such as Midjourney "is image generation conditioned by text." If you tell an AI image generator you want an image of a cat, for instance, "it generates an image and then it looks at the text and it's like, this can't be any image; it has to be an image of a cat." With Muse, that conditioning is "on not just the video of people playing the game, but actually the buttons they were pressing." This means that when we talk about the 'playable' models, such as this latest version of Muse, and Google's similarly controversial Genie, "it is doing video generation, but you can also say "Generate the next frame of the video if the jump button was being pressed," and it will take that into account when it generates the next frame." The key point here is that this all remains fundamentally predictive, in the same way that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are ultimately predicting sequences of words based on your text prompts. I put the same explain-this-to-me-like-the-layperson-I-am question to Hofmann, who is senior principal researcher and the lead of Microsoft's game intelligence research team. Softly spoken, with a slight German accent, Hofmann is a precise talker, measuring words in her combination of seasoned public spokesperson familiar with the conference trail, and excitable research grad who still believes in the work. "In simple terms," she says, the first model "shows we can train an AI simulation of an existing video game. So that means if we train a model on the game visuals and the control actions, we learn a model that is then able to simulate this." So, she continues, "you create a small, playable scene, that's only backed then at inference time by the model," inference time being the duration it takes for the model to process new, unseen data and make predictions on it. In the "real time" version of this model, then, this actually "allows players to connect the controller and play within the imagination - or play within the model." In even more simple terms, think of it like this: Muse is a model that generates simulated video footage of the video game it's been trained on, and simulates interactivity with that footage by predicting what your button presses would cause that video footage to do, and then replicating those. So if, for example, all of the Bleeding Edge footage used as training data shows that when players push the right analogue stick upwards in Bleeding Edge, the camera looks upwards, then when "playing the model", pushing the analogue stick upwards likewise causes the simulated video feed to tilt upwards towards the sky. All this notion of "playing" Muse raises one particularly important question: is Muse generating video games? The emphatic answer from both Hofmann and Cook is, essentially: no. For Cook, there's a question about whether it's even accurate to describe Muse, and similar models such as Genie or Oasis, as "playable" at all. "On YouTube you can watch panoramic video and turn your head around, but that's not "playable" video. That's just a video that has some interaction with it." At the same time, he says, "if you think about those streaming services where you were playing at home and your keyboard inputs were being sent to a server," such as say, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna or the doomed Google Stadia, "your computer was just showing you video. And the video was kind of conditioned on keyboard inputs." It's best to think of it instead as "video of a 3D world, but the 3D world doesn't really exist." Whether that does or doesn't disqualify it from actually being a game is up for debate. As Cook himself says, "it gets a bit philosophical at some point." (An example of a natural follow-on question that's either fascinating or incredibly boring to you, depending on your persuasion: does a video game world defined by fixed code "exist"? Does it exist on your hardware more than a streamed one from a server? Or, as in Muse's case, a very murky, inconsistent one conjured on the spot from no code at all?) During our initial conversation, Hofmann extended an invitation to visit the Microsoft AI research team's offices in Cambridge in order to try out a demo of Muse in person. There, she elaborated further on this notion of playing the model, rather than its attempt at recreating a game. "We're trying not to refer to it as a game, because it is not a game," Hofmann tells me during the in-person demo, which this time takes place after the reveal of the Quake 2 simulation. "We're thinking of "playing the model", so that exploratory kind of interaction of figuring out: What are the limitations? Where does it break? What doesn't work, what works?" To Hofmann, it's a process she feels is "fascinating," albeit joking that said fascination might be reserved for a very specific subset of researchers who share her enthusiasm. In fact to Hofmann, testing the boundaries of where the model breaks is in many ways part of the point of publishing the Quake 2 demo, and indeed creating it in the first place. She compares it to other, non-interactive generative AI favourably in that sense, in that with attempting to replicate video games you can simply find the flaws much faster. "If you interact with a chatbot, you never get that immediate experience of: I can essentially see where data is missing, or where it's making mistakes. Here, because we're so wired for 3D interaction and visual interaction, we get that immediate experience of: you can literally debug the model by going in and playing within this environment," she says. "And to me, that is the key fascinating aspect of what we're able to show here." Having "played the model" myself both via the online, browser-based Quake 2 Copilot demo and again in person, via an Xbox controller connected to Hofmann's laptop, this notion does have an element of truth to it. I played an updated version of the Bleeding Edge-based simulation alongside the Quake 2 one - both based on WHAMM (note the second M), which is the more recent version that makes the Quake 2 demo possible - and also tested out the drag-and-drop functionality of adding interactable items, jump pads, and enemies in real time. It's worth making very clear up front that both of them are, as video games, utterly terrible, for all the many reasons already detailed at length and with far more satisfying bite elsewhere than I could ever conjure: they're fuzzy, laggy, nightmarish non-places, chugging along at nine frames per second, crucially without much in the way of consistent internal logic, let alone meaning or intent. They are, by every measure of playability, unplayable. However, treated as a kind of meta-game, where the challenge isn't within the game but in just attempting to successfully play it at all, there is something at least novel and interesting here. In one moment of quasi-Quake 2, for instance, I found myself stuck in a dark, underwater secret area with no apparent way out, not helped by the vagueness and inconsistency of the visuals and controls. Then I realised I could "play the model" to escape, effectively gaming its 0.9 second memory by looking at a dark wall for a moment, then turning back around to discover the world had totally changed and a route was now clear. These are, in their own ways, the kinds of consistent rules we need to make something a game, learned in the same way we learn any other mechanic or moment of internal game logic: if I do X, Y happens. That, technically, is a video game. And arguably an interesting one, if only given its novelty and context, much the same way as an out-there art gallery installation can be when you're only interacting with it once or twice. But also still not a particularly good one. That also ties into the natural follow-on question here, which asks what the actual point of this model is, and what its uses might or might not eventually be. If the question of whether or not Muse's synthetic creations are video games seems a tad murky, this next one's about as clear as mud. Who, or what, is Muse actually for? Again, this question rapidly takes on a philosophical form as soon as you begin to prod at it, but before we get to the real chin-stroking it makes sense to run through the proposed uses that've already been suggested so far. One of the prominent, and most easy to dismiss, is this notion of preservation touted by Phil Spencer. Hofmann, it's worth noting, was on that slightly odd, video call-style reveal video with Spencer when he raised this as a possibility. I asked her whether she felt that was a genuinely feasible use for Muse, now or at any point in the future. "What I see at this point in time is that we're having so many conversations on what could be the potential branch-out points into real applications," she said, "and game preservation has been one of them that multiple people have brought up. And one that Phil, for example, was particularly excited about." However, she continued, "I see this as one of the capabilities of not something that is, in any full form, feasible today. I like to ground it in: what's feasible today is I can create a simulation of a level in a game, that gives you a sense of playing a version of that game, that is not exactly like the real game." "My sense is that over the next decade, this technology will mature," she added, noting that she felt it "perfectly feasible" to believe it could eventually be "a very general way" of preserving a video game in some form. "I'm certain it won't be the only one. But I see that. I do see it as something that could be exciting to explore along with other application areas." Cook is unequivocal here, meanwhile. "Think about your favourite game, and think about the footage of it that's on YouTube," he said. "If we were going to learn the game based on that footage, what stuff isn't seen very often? What stuff is maybe not seen at all? Maybe there's secrets no one's ever found. Bugs, glitches. "And also on maybe a stupider kind of level - but still important to think about - is things like when dataminers find cut content from Elden Ring. Or how if you look in very old games, you can find comments in the codebase from developers who are working at 4:00am and writing messages in the code. That stuff obviously can't be locked, can't be recovered, because the computer can't see it." An analogy he offers here: "The Globe Theatre that I walk past is not the real Globe Theatre. It's still useful that we built it. But it would be great if we also had the original." Hypothetically, he adds, even if this method got "99 percent of the way there, ultimately it isn't the same as actually recording the code base, for a million and one reasons." The next suggestion here feels like less a piece of executive ad-libbing, and more a central to Microsoft's core pitch for Muse: "gameplay ideation" - a rather corporate term for, essentially, thinking up stuff you can do in a game. Muse is explicitly being touted as a potential tool for helping with this, but crucially, and as we've already clarified, it's not coming up with ideas or inventing gameplay itself in any way. "There are philosophical questions around: can models be creative?" Hofmann said, when I asked her to clarify. "And I'm quite firmly on the side that they are not. I've seen a lot of confusion around that in the literature. But by framing Muse as: it is a simulation of an existing video game, I think that quite firmly emphasises that the model in itself is not creative." What the research team was instead aiming to achieve, after conversations with developers internally at Microsoft, "was exactly to tease out the model capabilities that could unlock human creativity." In other words, the team is attempting to figure out how models like this, if they were to become faster, more efficient, more accurate and so on, might be useful to human developers in the future. In this case, it comes back to the initial demonstration of Muse with Bleeding Edge, where you could drag and drop something into the game - a jump pad, an explosive barrel, an enemy - and then quickly see how that plays out. Is that actually feasible as a method of seriously prototyping game ideas, and even if it was, would it actually be helpful? With the first question, Hofmann describes the output of the current version of the model as "not-fully-working" and for now only an example of "signs of life", but despite plenty of scepticism from the watching public, her confidence in its ability to improve seems ironclad. That confidence is based on what Hofmann believes to be genuine discoveries in how these models can operate, she explains, such as gaining an understanding of "how we can curate data to craft - or to train - models that capture those structural relationships in the data." By "structural relationships", she adds, what she specifically means is "the understanding of how this model is able to translate an image into numbers, and then learn how those numbers relate to each other." In the simplest possible terms, Hofmann feels the team has learned how being specific with training data in certain ways can give you much more reliable outputs, and with less data required. That newfound understanding has "opened up this really big space around how specifically curated data sets and multi-modal models interact with each other, and the kinds of structures they're able to learn." When does that potential become actual, usable reality for some kind of developer-friendly jump pad-testing tool? There's "a lot of runway", she says, though "I can't give you a timeline. I can't tell you specifically which innovation is going to come after the other, but it's basically opened up this huge, huge space… I cannot see the end of how far we're going to be able to get with that." Whether or not this might actually be useful to developers is another issue, however. Cook, for his part, is sceptical again, suggesting more immediately helpful (and efficient) avenues for this kind of tool might be found in quickly adding a splash of a game's visuals and other details to standard whiteboxing, or adding new forms of immediate, quickfire automatic playtesting that don't currently exist. "Human playtesters exist," he says, "but there are some techniques that require you to have an automatic playtester." Nevertheless, Cook is keen to praise Microsoft for having actually sought input from real game developers, something that Hofmann also repeatedly points to. "One of my favourite things about the paper is that they actually sat down with developers and talked to them," Cook says, "and often they talked of developers that were already very positive about the technology - but they still actually said to them: What would a workflow that looks useful for you be? I thought that was really important and we need more of that stuff." One other, important question comes up here, when it comes to the practical implementation of this kind of hypothetical tool. How could a developer use Muse to simulate adding a new mechanic to an in-development game, when doing so currently requires training Muse on, as in Bleeding Edge's case, about 7000 hours of the already-finished game's footage? Hofmann argues the team has indeed thought of this, and it came up in the conversations the research team had with developers. "We look at: assume a scenario where let's say someone has built out a first level of a new game that they're working on - how little data might they need to train a model like this?" The team is "nowhere near the full version of making that real," she said, "but we now know that we can get away with as little as about 50 hours of gameplay from a given game level to create a really nice, consistent representation in that." The very fact that there is so much uncertainty over possible uses for Muse, however, leads on to yet another, regularly posed query. Isn't this all being done back to front? "A solution looking for a problem" is a criticism regularly levied at all kinds of AI ventures, particularly generative AI ones. In many cases it feels entirely justified. AI-generated video and images, such as those produced by Midjourney and Sora, have thus far failed to find any real purpose beyond generating low-effort memes, objectionable propaganda and disinformation, or unanimous criticism whenever used in relation to a video game. Generative text, such as ChatGPT, has fared better in terms of gaining weekly users, which have landed in the hundreds of millions, but poorly in terms of actually making any money from that (the vast majority of those users use it for free, and using it costs OpenAI a huge amount of money). Text-based gen-AI's main uses seem to remain helping Instagram influencers and spammers to rapidly fill out inessential image captions to game the algorithm, meanwhile, or disrupting more trustworthy Google search results with such valuable advice as eating rocks for good health. Naturally, that same criticism was levied again at Muse after its reveal of the Quake 2 demo. Sos Sosowski, an indie developer, issued one of the most widely-shared putdowns on BlueSky with exactly this. "That's very on-track with [the] AI trend," he wrote. "A solution looking for a problem. It's yet another in a series of "reveals" that is bug-ridden and broken." In talking to Cook and Hofmann, who both work in very different areas of AI-based academic research, I was particularly curious about this. How does the actual timeline of research unfold here? Whose idea was Muse? How did it begin, or change over time? And is it normal to do things this way round, in the academic world, in researching technology first and worry about finding a use for it later? "What used to happen at Microsoft Research Cambridge - I used to know someone who worked there," Cook says, "and they used to joke that they felt like Microsoft didn't know they existed, and in a good way. Because they didn't ask what they were doing with their money, and so the researchers there would just do whatever they were interested in and had a great time doing it." The one exception to that? "The Xbox team that was there - and I think over time, there's been more scrutiny on what the AI teams are doing." He has a few suggestions as to how this initial research might have come to be. Sometimes, he explains, "ideas like this are born out of a single researcher or a hackathon day, or a conversation over coffee." Likewise, "it might have been born out of something more specific," like say, if there's a large data source that's already available. "So it's like: listen, we've got 400,000 hours of people playing this game, there must be something we can do with it." I put the same question to Hoffman, who for her part offered a detailed explanation which seems to quite closely echo some of Cook's best guesses. "Microsoft Research is quite unique, I would say, in that it's a very bottom-up research organisation," she explains. "Our remit is to drive innovation, to drive the start of the art in our respective areas." In practical terms that means combining their research into machine learning with, for instance, "leveraging the rich data that we can in many cases responsibly obtain in video games, where we might be able to get to a scale or a variety that might be very, very difficult to collect in any other application area." That'll be the readily-available data theory, then, and in this case that's down to the End User License Agreement (EULA) that all players agree to when playing games on Xbox. Under that often-ignored agreement, Xbox was able to gather the video data of, for instance, Bleeding Edge gameplay that it used to train its model. This combination of the research area and the available data then melds with the "luxury" of Microsoft being a large, multidisciplinary company. That grants the research team the "opportunity of engaging with the rest of the company and seeing what's on people's minds," as Hofmann puts it, "and so we have those regular conversations with people in the gaming space to understand what limitations, what challenges they're facing. Where do they see things going?" The research team itself then decides, "within the team", how to direct its research. In this case, Hofmann says the notion of something to help with "ideation" was one that came more or less directly from conversations with developers. "Many of them felt that because game development is so expensive, and prototyping is expensive, everyone who mentioned it felt like they did not have the luxury of doing enough ideation and prototyping - which they felt limited the creativity of what ultimately got built," she explained. As for the specific timeline, Hofmann says the research team started discussions with Ninja Theory as far back as 2018, when Microsoft first purchased the developer, in part because the two are simply both based in Cambridge. The team looked at various options, "very much with an open-ended, exploration point of view - so there was never an expectation that any of the things that we do would actually be put into the games." Ninja Theory then offered the gameplay data the studio had collected under the Bleeding Edge EULA to the research team in 2020, the data was anonymised and imported, and the research carried on from there. The specifics of what the team actually chose to do with this data, meanwhile, wasn't fully settled on until the autumn of 2022, when Hofmann returned from maternity leave to a world where LLMs such as ChatGPT had begun to grow in use and public awareness. "The world had changed in AI," she says, "in the sense of, suddenly, the broad population knew what language models were and what they could do… and so we within the team took that step back and said, well, how does that impact our work? What are the next frontiers that we can explore?" Ultimately, they decided, "Well, we know what works for language, wouldn't it be amazing to figure out what happens when we train on a large amount of actual human gameplay data?" Notably, Muse is actually one of two research projects being worked on in parallel by the team. The group, of around 10 to 15 researchers, can usually accommodate around "one to three" projects at a time, Hofmann said, with Muse a "sustained effort over the better part of two years," and more than half the team involved for much of that time. There were in fact "multiple points" during the project where the team almost stopped work on it, with any further progress "in the balance" until the "huge public response" to the paper that was published in Nature back in late February allowed the team to continue. To come back to that core question of whether it's standard practice to work this way round, Hofmann's answer was clear: first that, yes, it is indeed normal. And second, in her view, that her research team actually placed more emphasis on practical uses than most research of this nature normally would. "In terms of the research process, it's very common to be purely curiosity driven," she said. "And in many ways, I see our project as an example of not doing it this way - which is ironic, because a lot of people don't see that. We started from technical curiosity, but as soon as we saw signs of life - of this is what it's able to do - we put together that interdisciplinary team. We did the user research to understand what the capabilities would be, how this ultimately enabled specific use cases, and then we were especially focusing on ideation and early prototyping. While Hofmann is clear about the order in which the research has unfolded, and the level to which developers have been consulted along the way, the elephant in the room is Microsoft itself. Microsoft is one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies, and one which happens to be in an arms race with other, AI-focused tech competitors, as each attempts to justify - and find a way to ultimately profit - from their investments. OpenAI notably lost $5bn last year and is projected to lose double that in 2025, and triple in 2026. In late February it was revealed that Microsoft had backed out of new datacentre leases with a power capacity equivalent to the entire operational IT load of London, potentially signalling a lack of demand to meet its previously planned generative-AI supply. There is, obviously, an incentive for Microsoft to reveal new, exciting things that can be done with generative AI as early as possible. As Cook puts it, while Muse "has some really interesting qualities to it" and there are "things in there that could be useful for developers," those things aren't really the focus of how the research was presented by Microsoft in the first place. "A lot of the positioning does seem to be: positioning yourself as a company that uses AI and that invests in AI and that is on top of AI advances. It does seem to be a shareholders thing." To Cook, the way Muse has been presented in general is a concern. To him, "there's a difference between what the researchers were trying to achieve, and how Microsoft presented it - and in this case, I thought it was very stark. I really felt like they were kind of hung out to dry in some ways." I put this to Hofmann - both the question of why this was being revealed to the public so early, given its "not-fully-working" nature, as Hofmann herself put it, and of whether she felt the team had struggled to communicate what their research actually was. "I think there's as many opinions and drivers of this as we have people in the team, and potentially a lot more," Hofmann laughed, on the topic of going public early. "Part of it comes from the academic research community. Within academic research, there is a drive and incentive and realisation that it's important to be as open as possible," she explains. "A lot of research does not get into the hands of people where they can try something this quickly… we said, 'Okay: there is something here that even has that possibility; a lot of research is not very accessible by definition; so here is something that could be accessible. Let's put it out.'" At the same time, Hofmann agrees it would be "largely accurate" to say there's been some difficulty in properly communicating what Muse is all about. "Our learnings are very much around: how do we explain what's happening here, what the technical capability is? How do we make that very clear? And with anything we explain, we'll never be able to reach everyone, but I'm certainly looking at the social media activity and I'm taking notes of, okay, here's where the confusion is." Hofmann maintains, however, that even though there's still "a lot of confusion around what it actually is and what is the purpose, and a lot of debate around that," there has been positive feedback for the team. "Interestingly, everyone who commented on the technical achievement called it impressive, or [were] even more hyperbolic. So on the technical level I'm really satisfied, because people appreciate the achievement, which is fantastic." That said, Hofmann concedes that the downside of going this early is the impact on the conversation. "It's not something that happens that commonly, even in an age where AI research does move quickly and people do push out an archive white paper or a video demonstration," she says. Typically, when researchers publish something usable, such as an app, members of the public "expect a certain level of product polish, and we're between those. The technology is not ready. We're very explicit - trying to be very explicit - that this is a technical demo where we intend to show what is becoming possible, and how the field is moving." The goal for that, she says, is to at least "give people that background" to be able to then compare progress down the line. "I'm hoping that ultimately, all those steps will lead to both us understanding how to communicate this more clearly, and then also to the public having built up some of that understanding that helps them interpret what's going on there." For all the big questions and elephants-in-the-room we've worked through so far, there is one more cluster to go that is without doubt the biggest: the many questions of ethics. As anyone loosely familiar with AI, particularly generative AI, will already know, there are a number of ethical issues that very justifiably arise with each discussion. The first of those is the matter of plagiarism - or intellectual property rights - which in the case of Muse is slightly easier to put aside. Microsoft owns Bleeding Edge developer Ninja Theory and also Quake 2, via Zenimax, and under the EULA therefore has rights to the gameplay footage used as training data here. (That said, there are of course ethical questions about whether it's right for Microsoft, or any entity, to impose EULAs which collect user data at will on anyone wanting to play their games. And indeed about whether it's right for Microsoft to own such a large share of the games industry today - but these are questions for another time.) More applicable here is the second essential question with generative AI ethics, which is the environmental impact from the sheer amount of energy used to both train the model, and then to use it in practice. "The energy cost is, I would say, more than you would want for an actual player-facing experience," Hofmann said regarding the Quake 2 demo, when I asked her about this. That public demo uses Nvidia H100 GPUs for the inference, which Hofmann describes as "very similar to an LLM, or a chat bot," in terms of energy cost, and similarly for the training process as well. "What's making me optimistic about where we can push this is, one, the insights from those last two months around how little data, how little training, and how small a model we could get away with," she adds, which she claims is "nowhere near the end" right now. "We haven't really optimised this for inference cost, for example, or for more efficient training." "I can't tell you when, but I'm confident this will run on a consumer GPU, or an NPU [neural processing unit] on a mobile phone," she says, giving a rough estimate of "less than two years" until that's possible in terms of inference cost. As for training cost, "the more we learn about how to do this data efficiently, the more we pave the way to something that is truly democratising access to this." I asked Hofmann if she knew the specific numbers involved in terms of current energy cost, either to train or to "play" the model, to which she directed me to Microsoft PR. Microsoft PR told us they did not have anything additional to share beyond what had been published via the company's blog. As far as broader ethical concerns go, this is far from the last of it. Cook, for instance, suggests one less-cited worry with 3D video game gen-AI more broadly: "It feels like it's sort of a long play for moving toward robotics," he says. "Obviously a lot of these researchers are interested in this stuff for their own sake," he notes, but large tech companies - including those beyond Microsoft, such as Alphabet and Meta - are at least partially looking into AI as it corresponds to video games specifically, he says, because "these projects have two features: they work on video data; and they need to have some model of the world when an action is taken. And these two things are also really important for robots." He qualifies this, adding, "I know the Muse team, they're interested in games, they're really excited by this stuff. But I think one of the reasons why we're seeing big tech companies invest more in this kind of game-modelling stuff, and why they often talk about it as "worlds" and things like that, is because games have always been a research platform for other purposes." Less speculatively, there's the more immediate fact that, as Cook puts it, "for lots of the proposals for tools that are powered by AI, their use case seems to be that they would reduce employment. There doesn't seem to be a way around this." Coupled with a growing concern that video game bosses may be implementing AI in their workplaces with a mixture of ignorance and artlessness - one recent report based on a handful of accounts quoted anonymous developers, with one describing it as "an overwhelmingly negative and demoralising force" - there is plenty of reason for those concerns. All combined, it makes for an almighty mixture of ethical, philosophical, scientific and financial questions - which perhaps is to be expected, given the broader state of AI and the public's natural response to it right now. All those issues are only heightened and complicated by this practice of essentially performing scientific research in front of a live audience, be that out of the pure idealism of accessibility or, I can't help but suspect, the business incentive to do so. For Hofmann, it remains a project that, at least to her, is as personally worthwhile as it is anything else. Her hope is that regardless of the ultimate use case, the research may "add to the wealth and breadth of interactive experiences that are available to us," be that through adding these dream-like (or maybe more accurately for the foreseeable: somewhat nightmarish) elements of an AI-generated game simulation directly, as some kind of additional medium for artistic expression, or in just helping developers think up something else entirely. "I love video games; I recently got back into Quake 2," she laughs, "I played Cocoon recently… I don't even define myself as a gamer, but there aren't enough games to satisfy the time I would like to spend playing." For her, she concludes, "if people are able to use this to create something that is meaningful to them, and there are people who enjoy it - if I could play a role in that, I'd be happy." A fellow researcher, I get the sense that Cook remains sympathetic to Hofmann and her team, even if the goals and natures of their research are notably different. I ask him somewhat bluntly, towards the end of our conversation, if he feels people are right in reacting so viscerally to what Microsoft revealed, even with all the communication mishaps, the well-meaning intentions, and the public learning-on-the-fly in mind. "I think it's justified for a number of reasons," he says. "One of the reasons is just simply that people are so burned out and hurt by all of the things that are happening in the space, that I think there's just a general sense of anger and despair. And I think that's completely understandable." The industry has, of course, been going through a prolonged period of unprecedented layoffs and general uncertainty. The people staying in the industry after all this, as Cook puts it, "they're doing it because they truly love it and they want to do it, and so seeing this creative practice that they love treated in a sort of disrespectful way, it hurts them as well. It's not just about the morals or the ethics or anything like that. This is a thing they care about." When it comes to this practice of doing science in public, and how these findings are presented, he adds, "I see that there's a responsibility. The public are not stupid, but they can only work with the information they're given, and often they're given really bad information." "And so we have to think that going with these gut reactions makes sense right now; it's all we've got to work with. And then hopefully over time, in the future, we can slightly start to build trust again and figure out the bits of AI that we want to keep and that we like." A final, forgotten question for Cook is also the most important. "Not even: does it make games better; but do people want it? And they don't have to want it - technology is rejected all the time, for all sorts of reasons," he says. "So with generative AI, the question should just be: do we want this? We don't have to do anything. We don't even have to make games if we don't want to. Sometimes we forget that we do have this power; we can just not have something if we don't want to. And so players should think more about: what do they really want from the future of games? Because they can want anything. They don't just have to want the things that they see in tech demos, at E3. They can build whatever future industry they want."

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A trader makes a bubble with a chewing gum ahead of the closing bell on the floor of the ... More New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 29, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) A simple options trade turned pennies into dollars - and the next move might already be brewing. Let’s rewind the clock to March 31st, 2025. SPY - the S&P 500 ETF - closed just above $559. Markets weren’t exactly calm as they had been falling for the past month. But the real trigger was yet to come. Trump was about to announce his tariff policy. Separately, tariff talk has been hurting tech stocks. See Meta Stock To $400? It wasn’t some backroom rumor - it was publicly known, and this created the perfect setup to go “long on volatility” - something not a lot of investors think about. When a shake-up like this happens, volatility spikes. It simply means making money when the volatility goes up. How could you have done that? Here is the trade: You could have bought put options on 31st Mar 2025, or if you were unsure of potential direction, hedged it by buying a call too and made it a straddle. And then squared off the trade a week later, bagging a massive sum. Missed SPY Opportunity If you had tossed in $1,000 on those puts, you’d be walking away with $30,000. Sure, you might not want to risk that much on options, but even a $100 risk could have made you $3,000 in a week. Not a bad trade, right? True. Nobody has a crystal ball. But that’s the wrong question. The better question is: Was it reasonable to expect something to happen? And the answer is: Absolutely! The market had priced in some tension, but it wasn’t bracing for a real shock. And if you’ve traded through enough macro events - tariff talk, Fed surprises, geopolitical curveballs - you know that buying options during uncertain times can pay off big. Not always. But often enough to make it worth a shot. Buying puts wasn’t a crazy gamble - it was a calculated hedge against known risk. And if you were more balanced, even buying a straddle (put + call) would’ve given you upside either way. SPY closed at just under $538 yesterday, 15th Apr 2025. The markets are still twitchy, the volatility has crept higher over the last three months, and option prices are reflecting that. Here’s what’s interesting: If you look at at-the-money straddles (call and put premiums combined for $538 strike - current SPY levels) expiring Tuesday next week, they’re priced around $14.70 or a little under 3% of the current SPY price. This implies the market expects a move of a little under 3% in either direction. Is that realistic? Maybe. Maybe not. But here’s the thing: Short-term volatilities in the market are not uncommon and are often challenging to navigate. However, long-term outperformance is hopefully what matters to you. If so, consider investing in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Title: 'I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed': Wall Street is rethinking its Trump bet

Good morning. Bill Gates says AI is coming for a slew of jobs, including two that once seemed tech-proof: teachers and doctors. What will be left for us humans to do? "Retire early," Gates said. In today's big story, Wall Street dealmakers thought Trump was the answer. Now, they're not so sure. What's on deck Markets: Why I want to work on Wall Street: College students explain. Tech: OpenAI is on a hiring spree, and one area of investment stands out. Business: Realtors and Zillow are going to war, but homebuyers will pay the price. But first, Wall Street is having doubts. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed," a managing director at a middle market-focused investment bank told BI. They were talking about the many soothsayers in Wall Street's C-suites who had bet that the new administration would revive a comatose dealmaking market. Things haven't quite worked out that way. Goldman Sachs said that the paralyzed deal market dragged revenue from deal work down 22% in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. On every bank's Q1 earnings calls in recent days, one person loomed large: President Donald Trump. No CEOs mentioned him by name. Instead, they talked about uncertainty, worried clients, and a concerning economic outlook, BI's Reed Alexander writes. "While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year," Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup, said. Behind the scenes, bankers told BI that they were feeling less diplomatic about the Trump administration and its tariff policies: "If you're an executive in finance and you talk to clients frequently and you understand how the world works, there's no way you can't be upset." A fuller picture of how Trump is impacting Wall Street may not emerge until the next earnings season later this summer. Many of the worst days of recent volatility happened in April — the second quarter. Whether the White House will care is another matter. 1. Netflix: Sell-off, who? Netflix's shares have climbed more than 10% in 2025, outperforming its mega-cap tech peers and a struggling broader market. Some analysts consider the stock to be recession-resistant. 2. Bring it on, Wall Street. A career path in finance can be notoriously brutal, but young people are embracing it anyway. More than 150 Wall Street-bound college students told BI their hopes, fears, and reservations about launching careers in the industry. 3. Should investors go risk-on again or stay defensive? President Trump recently hinted at a potential exemption for the auto industry. It's not the first time he's walked back on tariffs, and some investors are questioning if they should stop taking his remaining tariff threats seriously. 1. OpenAI's hiring spree. The AI startup's looking for new talent as it ramps up its infrastructure ambitions. Dozens of open roles related to AI infrastructure are listed on its website. 2. Zuck still seems salty about a failed deal from 12 years ago. Mark Zuckerberg's failed Snapchat bid from 2013 resurfaced at Meta's antitrust trial, and it doesn't sound like he's over it. He told the court Meta would've accelerated Snap's growth if the deal went through, FWIW. 3. Alphabet's supply-chain project is going solo. Chorus, Alphabet's bet on optimizing the global supply chain, is becoming an independent company, its CEO told BI. After several years under Alphabet's X incubator, the companies believe spinning it off will help Chorus move faster. 1. Realtors and Zillow are going to war. Last week, Zillow unveiled a new rule that would ban home listings that are initially selectively marketed to the public. The move takes direct aim at giant real estate brokerages — and it's bound to start an ugly fight. 2. This app wants to pay you to shop. No, it's not a scam. Claim gives users money to redeem at partner businesses each week. Its CEO told BI he wants it to disrupt the advertising sector and help combat the youth loneliness epidemic. Here's how it works. 3. Fewer planes in the skies. United Airlines announced it's cutting domestic flights by 4% starting in July, citing less travel demand. The company said it was "impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. Stock market data growth chart graph investment finance analysis fintech financial district The roller-coaster ride in the stock market has continued as Friday’s seemingly positive reduction in the tariffs on electric goods was deemed temporary on Sunday before the markets opened on Monday. China’s new policy on not accepting the delivery of Boeing jets was announced early Tuesday which is a further sign that the trade war is heating up not cooling down. The new rhetoric on pharma tariffs once again does not exhibit any real understanding of what new tariffs might mean. In a Tuesday CNBC interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb revealed that “just about 70% of the key ingredients, key chemicals substances that are used” to make widely used generic drugs all originate in China. The former FDA commissioner is concerned that additional tariffs on some of these life-saving drugs, which have a small profit margin, will not continue to be produced because of new tariffs. After the market closed a regulatory filing by NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) reported that the U.S. “required required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip. The chip giant said the move would result in $5.5 billion in charges to the company.” In early trading Wednesday, NVDA was down 6.7%, trading at $104.71, which is down $7.50 from Tuesday’s close. There had been some signs over the past few days that the rebound was losing upside momentum. QQQ Many stocks opened very strong on Monday as there were hopes the Friday announcement of lower tariffs might be a sign of progress. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) had closed on Friday at $454.40 but opened Monday at $464.46 which was 2.2% higher. QQQ closed Monday at $457.48 which was well below the day’s high of $465.05. On Tuesday the QQQ again traded above the 20-day EMA at $461.32 but closed at $457.99. There is chart support to watch at Friday’s low of $441.33 with the monthly S1 pivot support at $446.74. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line has just rebounded back to its EMA as it closed just above it on Tuesday. If the QQQ A/D numbers are negative on Wednesday it will be consistent with a failing rally. There is support at the recent lows and then the uptrend, line c. The AD line needs to move above the downtrend, line b, to signal that the correction in QQQ is over. The relative performance (RS) is above its EMA but it needs to overcome the recent highs to indicate that QQQ is now leading the SPY. A move above the major RS resistance at line d is needed to confirm that QQQ is leading the SPY. NYSE Composite The loss of upside momentum was also evident on the more broadly-based NYSE Composite as it closed Tuesday on the day’s lows as it failed to reach the 20-day EMA at 18,663. There is further chart resistance, line a, in the 18,818 area. The NYSE McClellan Oscillator rallied from the April 8 low to close Tuesday just above zero at +10.59. The downtrend at line b needs to be overcome to signal a further rally. The NYSE All Advance/Decline line has rallied from the recent lows but is still below the declining EMA and resistance at line d. The downtrend in the A/D line (line c) needs to be overcome to turn it positive. The S&P futures are down 41 points at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is an hour before the open. Of course, it is the close that will be more important. If the stock market declines sharply for a few days it will hopefully encourage a return to sanity before there are new ill-informed tariffs on the pharma industry.

U.S. stock futures moved lower Wednesday as investors braced for another wave of geopolitical and earnings headlines. S&P 500 futures were down 0.5%, the Dow hovered near flat, and Nasdaq futures dropped more than 1%. These are the stocks most likely to shape the news. Wednesday’s most closely watched story centers on Nvidia (NVDA), which disclosed a $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its H20 AI chips to China. The Biden administration initially crafted the export controls to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Nvidia’s stock is down nearly 7% premarket. Given its rank as the third-largest U.S. company by market value, the fallout could be wide. Chipmaker AMD (AMD) also dropped 6% premarket. In Europe, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — just below analyst forecasts — and warned of “greater uncertainty” ahead due to U.S.-China tariff tensions. ASML, which makes the machines used in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, has seen its shares fall 28% over the past year despite the AI boom. Also before the bell, Abbott Labs (ABT) — best known for developing medical devices and consumer health staples like Pedialyte and Ensure — topped earnings expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $1.09 on 4% reported sales growth. Its medical devices segment surged nearly 13% on an organic basis, driven by a 20% jump in diabetes care. Shares were flat to modestly higher ahead of the open. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, posted first-quarter core FFO of $1.27 per share, meeting estimates. The company, which operates logistics hubs crucial to global supply chains, highlighted solid rent growth and occupancy, even as leasing cooled. “Policy uncertainty is making customers more cautious,” said CEO Hamid Moghadam. “But over the long term, limited new supply and high construction costs support continued rent growth.” Kinder Morgan (KMI), CSX (CSX), and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are also set to report Wednesday, offering insight into the state of energy infrastructure, transportation, and regional banking. Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook, while March retail sales data is due, offering a window into consumer behavior before the latest tariff escalation. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains stuck in “extreme fear” territory, a mood that’s proven hard to shake since President Trump’s early April tariff blitz. And for good reason: Even amid the hard numbers of earnings season, markets are now being driven less by fundamentals and more by policy whiplash. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often delivered via social media or offhand remarks — are proving just as influential as official actions. It’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%. Nvidia stock plunged 6.9% after the company disclosed a $5.5 billion charge linked to fresh U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips — once seen as a workaround for earlier bans. AMD (AMD) stock fell 7.4%, while chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7% after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates and warned that escalating tariffs could cloud the global outlook through 2026. Markets retreated further as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were “highly likely” to fuel inflation, and suggested the central bank will wait to gauge their effect before lowering interest rates. “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,” Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. “The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.” “For the time being,” Powell said, “we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Still, there were bright spots. Abbott Labs (ABT) beat earnings expectations with adjusted EPS of $1.09 and double-digit organic growth in its medical device division, including a 20% jump in diabetes-related products. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, met forecasts with $1.27 in core FFO and reaffirmed guidance — but noted rising customer caution. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales surged 1.4% in March, the biggest monthly gain since January 2023. Analysts said shoppers likely pulled purchases forward to avoid tariff-driven price hikes: Think customers loading up on TVs and T-shirts at Costco (COST) ahead of potential price pain. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains in “extreme fear” territory — a mood that’s proven hard to shake since Trump’s tariff barrage earlier this month. It should come as no surprise: This is a market increasingly driven by policy whiplash, cheerleading soundbites, and dropped hints of trade negotiations. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often via social media or offhand remarks — are proving as influential as official announcements. And it’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. The most closely watched story Wednesday centered on Nvidia (NVDA), the third-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and its disclosure of the $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its AI chips to China. The Biden administration originally designed export controls to curtail China’s access to advanced AI chips — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Also in chips news, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion, or about $8.7 billion— below analyst expectations — and flagged “greater uncertainty” ahead due to tariffs. ASML, which makes the machines essential to high-end chip manufacturing, has seen its stock fall by 28% over the last year despite the AI boom. Elsewhere, China posted 5.4% GDP growth for the first quarter, matching the prior quarter. Export activity surged as companies rushed to ship goods ahead of expected new U.S. tariffs. Beijing also named a new top trade negotiator. Still, market watchers seemed to see little clarity ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MARCH 10: In this photo illustration, the Adobe logo is displayed on a smartphone ... More screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting Adobe's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the software, digital media, and cloud computing sectors, on March 10, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Let’s not mince words – Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is a compelling buy at current levels. The company leads its sector, has exceptional fundamentals, is resting on a strong technical support level, and is trading at a valuation rarely seen for businesses of its caliber. With shares down over 40% from their 2024 peak, Adobe may appear to be struggling. But this type of weakness often attracts savvy investors. Still, investing in any single stock comes with risk. You can reduce that risk and still participate in the upside with our High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, delivering returns of over 91% since launch. Adobe remains strong. Consider the following metrics: All of this comes with a P/E ratio below 25. That’s right, a sub-25 P/E for Adobe – one of the most reliable SaaS businesses out there. It’s a rare blend of quality and value that long-term investors seek. Here are the main reasons for the recent decline: But none of these factors undermine Adobe’s core strengths and long-term prospects. Beyond the compelling valuation, Adobe currently sits at a key technical support level that previously fueled rallies in 2020 and 2023. In 2023 alone, it surged nearly 80% from this price range. This isn’t just a number – it’s a historically proven base where market sentiment turns bullish. Adobe stands out as a timely opportunity. That said, timing individual stocks is difficult – it’s hard to consistently buy at lows or sell at highs. A more consistent approach is to use a periodic, trigger-based rebalancing strategy like we implement in our High Quality Portfolio. With 30 curated stocks, it has regularly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why? The HQ Portfolio delivers better returns with lower volatility than the index, as shown by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Title: The Death of ESG

Some have proclaimed ESG investing dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? Over the past few years, ESG investing has moved from a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world to a polarizing topic. Financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net-zero initiatives, and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? The pushback to ESG gained steam in 2021, when Texas passed Senate Bill 13, an anti-ESG law. It prohibits any government entity in the state from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting — as defined by Texas — the oil and gas industry. The resulting “blacklist” of companies deemed to be discriminating against oil and gas included financial firm BlackRock — which, ironically, invests billions of dollars in energy companies in Texas. Since then, legislators across the country have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills — some modeled after the 2021 Texas law — in 40 states, according to a legislative tracker maintained by climate research firm Pleiades Strategy. It’s not just politicians going after ESG. Behind this flurry of legislation lies a tangled web of different interests that have supported the plot to kill ESG: think tanks, state treasurers, oil and gas trade associations, culture warriors, and oil tycoons. In this episode – our ESG whodunit – we take out our magnifying glasses to take a closer look at the legislation that would spark dozens of other bills across the country. We’ll question a line-up of suspects at the center of the anti-ESG plot and dive into their motivations for protecting the fossil fuel industry.

Amy Scott: So how would you describe the smell? Elizabeth Trovall: It is, we haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Amy Scott: I'm on the bow of the Sam Houston, an elegant 95 foot boat with the breeze in my hair and the state flag of Texas flapping overhead. It's got the vibe of a pleasure cruise, if it weren't for the smell. Elizabeth Trovall: Oh yeah, now it's really pungent. Amy Scott: My colleague, Elizabeth Trovall, who covers energy for Marketplace, invited me on this boat tour, a ride along the Houston Ship Channel, the industrial waterway that connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf of Mexico. Voice 1: As we leave the Turning Basin, off to the left you will see public grain elevator number one... Amy Scott: Chugging along, we see big metal grain elevators and giant cargo ships from far away countries, which Elizabeth looks up on her phone. Elizabeth Trovall: Her length overall is 179.98 meters, and her width is 32 meters. She's a hefty lass. Amy Scott: Until we reach the source of that smell, the oil refineries. Elizabeth Trovall: There's a bunch of white cylinders jutting up in the ground, and then, like hundreds of much smaller tubes. Amy Scott: I can see flames or flaring coming out of some of those tubes and what looks like steam churning out of smoke stacks. Whenever you see pictures on the news of climate change, they always show this, yeah. Some serious climate change B roll right here. Refineries like the one we're floating by process hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil every day, barrels that help make the state of Texas the biggest exporter of petroleum products in the US, and are also fueling a planetary crisis. Elizabeth Trovall: Oil and gas has been so important for the Texas economy, the US economy, the global economy, but also, like what climate are we leaving our children and our children's children? Amy Scott: That tension between the power of oil and gas and the urgency of the climate crisis, that's at the heart of a mystery that we're here in Texas trying to unfold. We're floating on the Houston Ship Channel looking for some clues like Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot interrogating suspects on the Nile. We're hoping to untangle a complicated plot, a plot to kill ESG. This is How We Survive. I'm Amy Scott. ESG, that's the investing framework that looks at environmental, social and governance factors. In the last episode, we traced how it evolved from a niche concept embraced by faith based and other socially conscious investors to a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world. Cue the backlash. Over the past few years, financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net zero initiatives and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? In this episode, we take out our magnifying glasses to peer a little more closely at a piece of legislation in Texas that would spark dozens of other anti-ESG bills across the country, the weapon that made the first of a thousand cuts, all in service of protecting the fossil fuel industry. This episode, the death of ESG and the dark money behind its demise. ___ Okay? A little vertigo here. Oh, my God. We are in the, I guess this is the capitol rotunda, right? There's a star at the top of the dome that says, T, E, X, A, S, Texas. We're going to start our investigation where this all started, the state capitol building in Austin, Texas. And this is the heart of the Texas Legislature. We're here to meet with our first suspect in the plot to kill ESG. 06, Isaac. This is representative Carrie Isaac's office. Jason Isaac: Good to see you. Thanks for meeting me here. I appreciate it. Hey, how are you? I'm Jason. Amy Scott: But she's not who we're looking for. There's a rose. Jason Isaac: Yes, this is my wife's office, and apparently one of her colleagues gave her some sort of a rose for something. Amy Scott: Nice. We're here to meet this guy, her husband. That's our suspect. A proud one, I should say. You know what we're up to? We're looking at the rise of ESG investing as a concept, and then the backlash against it, sort of telling the story, and I understand you have a big role in the backlash part of that story. Jason Isaac: Yes, yeah. Amy Scott: Can you start by just introducing yourself? Jason Isaac: Sure. I'm Jason Isaac. I'm the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute. We're a non profit trade organization and research organization that represents American energy producers that support free markets, primarily oil, gas, coal and nuclear. Amy Scott: Jason Isaac has a bit of a reputation. Jason Isaac: It was Congressman Raskin who called me the Carbon King when I was testifying in front of Congress, because I said, I'm Jason Isaac, and I live a high carbon lifestyle, and I think the rest of the world should too. Amy Scott: So Jamie Raskin came up with that nickname? Jason Isaac: Jamie Raskin. It was, it was not a kind nickname. Amy Scott: But you've embraced it. Jason Isaac: I have. I love it. It's my license plate. I've got it on my business cards and my wallet. And I remind myself, and yes, absolutely. And I wish everybody else could be the Carbon King, too. Amy Scott: At the outset, you should know two things about Jason. Not only that he works on behalf of the oil and gas industry, but also he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is causing catastrophic climate change. Jason Isaac: I mean, if we're living in a catastrophic climate crisis, I want more of it, because people are prospering like never before because of energy. Amy Scott: Before he became known as the Carbon King, Jason was working at a conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He led an energy initiative there called Life Powered. He says it was around 2019 when he started to hear something that bothered him. Jason Isaac: I had specific drilling companies, I had services companies that were telling me that their banks were denying them access to financial services because they were in the oil and gas industry. Amy Scott: These energy companies suspected they were being denied because of the banks' ESG policies. Jason Isaac: And I didn't know what ESG was at first, I just said they're discriminating against politically unfavored industries like oil and gas and forestry and guns and ammunition manufacturers. Amy Scott: And so what did you decide to do about it? Jason Isaac: Well, it was interesting, because one of them kind of challenged me. It's like, Jason, you've got to fix this. And so I thought, oh gosh. Amy Scott: Jason says a light went off. He recalled a bill he'd worked on a few years earlier when he was serving in the Texas House of Representatives. It was aimed at preventing companies from boycotting Israel. So he thought, hey, why not just replace Israel with oil and gas? Jason Isaac: I essentially just said, If you boycott fossil fuels, you can't do business with the state of Texas. Amy Scott: The bill would prohibit any government entity in Texas, so pension funds or school districts, from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting oil and gas, a sort of boycott uno reverse card. So you boycotted companies that you saw as boycotting other companies? Jason Isaac: Yeah, I just didn't want them using our tax dollars, our pension dollars from teachers, firefighters, other first responders that are entrusted with companies. I didn't want those dollars, and in some cases, our tax dollars, being weaponized against the best interest of Texas. Amy Scott: So the sort of confusing thing here is that these companies that Jason sees as boycotting fossil fuels in Texas, these are financial firms and banks that, in some cases, invest billions of dollars in oil and gas in Texas, which seems like the opposite of a boycott. The problem, Jason says, is the way that some of these financial firms invest. Jason Isaac: They're investing in them, forcing them to transition, forcing them to adopt political agendas which are contrary to popular opinion here in the legislature in Texas, and so I really felt like they were weaponizing their capital, trying to, using Larry Fink's terms, force behaviors. Amy Scott: Remember Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, whose now infamous 2020 letter to CEOs declared that climate risk is investment risk? Jason says, while it's true, BlackRock invests more than $100 billion in Texas oil and gas, the company has also used its shareholder power to push companies to address climate change. To Jason and his conservative allies in the legislature, that kind of activism had no place in Texas. Voice 2: Senator Birdwell, you recognized committee substitute for Senate Bill 13 to suspend the regular order of business. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr... Amy Scott: In the spring of 2021, on the green carpet of the baroque Senate chambers, a Republican state senator brought Jason's anti-ESG bill, now known as Senate Bill 13, to a vote. Voice 3: On behalf of lucky number 13, Mr. President, I move final passage. Amy Scott: It passed the first chamber, the Senate, with almost no opposition. Voice 2: There being 26 ayes and four nays, the bill is finally passed. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr. President for all your work on this. Amy Scott: But one person in the room felt something was not quite right. Do you feel like you have a lonely position here? Nathan Johnson: I think there's a matter of record of I have a lonely position here. Amy Scott: This is state senator Nathan Johnson. He was one of the four nays on Senate Bill 13. He's a Democrat, a lawyer and a composer. Millennials may recognize his music from the TV anime show Dragon Ball Z. Nathan Johnson: I did the music for 67 episodes and five of their movies. Amy Scott: Do you still get royalties for that? Nathan Johnson: I don't get any royalties at all for that. I got into the business at the wrong time. Amy Scott: In our murder mystery scenario, Senator Johnson is like the witness watching in horror as the scene unfolded. Nathan Johnson: I think the whole notion of passing laws that interfere with the private flow of capital is anathema to the whole Texas ethos of being a business friendly state, and it smacked of big government interference with markets. Amy Scott: Battling some of the biggest financial firms in the US, limiting market options, telling companies what they can and can't do, seemed like just a different form of the market interference the bill's supporters claim to oppose. Nathan Johnson: The job of a financial services institution is to make money. They want to take capital and invest it and get it a return. And if they think they can do it with a wind farm or a pump jack, they're going to pick the one that gives a good return. Amy Scott: Increasingly, it's the wind or solar farm investors are betting on. Texas is actually leading the country in renewable energy production, and Johnson says this anti-ESG legislation looks to him like a campaign to slow down the transition. Nathan Johnson: Which I think is silly. The fossil fuel industry is well integrated with the renewable energy generation industry. Wind farms and solar farms are powering oil and gas operations. So it's unfortunate that we're having this silly conversation right now, because it's helping no one. Amy Scott: After SB 13 passed, again saying Texas would boycott any financial firms that boycott oil and gas, the state had to figure out who was in compliance, so officials created a black list. It named 10 firms at first, including BlackRock, which again, invested more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies at the time. It also included nearly 350 individual funds. The firms on the black list were banned from any financial activity that used state money. That meant everything from managing public pensions to underwriting municipal bonds, and that might have been the end of it, the infliction of this first cut to ESG, but for this man, our second suspect. ___ Would you mind just introducing yourself? Tell us who you are and what you do and where we are. Brian Hughes: Thanks. I'm Brian Hughes, and so glad to be with you in the Texas capitol today. Amy Scott: Senator Brian Hughes of district one in East Texas. Senator Hughes co-authored Senate Bill 13. But that bill, that first wound to ESG, wasn't enough for the Senator. He really wanted to twist the knife. Brian Hughes: Good morning, everyone. For many of you, I'll say, Welcome to Marshall, and for Marshall folks I'll say, Thank you for letting us be here and enjoy this... Amy Scott: He wanted to throw a harsher spotlight on what financial firms were up to with this ESG stuff, and make sure they knew Texas was serious about cracking down. So a couple months after the blacklist came out, in late 2022, Senator Hughes and the state affairs committee he chaired summoned a bunch of Wall Street firms to a remote corner of East Texas for questioning. Representatives from BlackRock, State Street, Global Advisors and institutional shareholder services, an advisory firm, made the trek out to the small city of Marshall, and were greeted with a show. Brian Hughes: We had the hearing in December and so the Christmas lights are up. There's an ice skating rink set up on the town square. It's a beautiful Norman Rockwell feel. What we were looking for was to be in this environment of a Hallmark movie. Except for the firms we subpoenaed. We wanted a John Grisham movie for them. Amy Scott: He gave them a six hour grilling, challenging them on all the ways they were trying to take down the fossil fuel industry, like offering ESG funds that screen out some energy companies, joining net zero initiatives aimed at drawing down emissions, voting to support some environmental and social shareholder resolutions like the board shake up at Exxon Mobil we talked about last episode. Brian Hughes: When it comes to ESG investing, which interest is BlackRock trying to serve? The general welfare of your clients, the general welfare of humanity, or the sole financial interest of those clients. Amy Scott: Again and again, Senators accused the companies of putting ideology ahead of their fiduciary duty to act in their clients' best interests, while company reps insisted that duty required them to consider ESG factors that could affect their investments. But Senator Hughes wasn't persuaded. BlackRock stayed on the black list. Brian Hughes: And our response to them has been very, very simple. If you don't want to be on the list, then don't attack the Texas energy industry. Amy Scott: Since then, the list has grown to a total of 16 companies and includes big global firms like BNP Paribas, HSBC and UBS. And the senator isn't done. He's now trying to pass other bills to prevent financial firms from considering non-financial factors in investing and lending decisions. In some ways, his tactics have worked. Before the hearing, Vanguard, another big asset manager, appeased Texas lawmakers by dropping out of a net zero initiative, and in the years since, BlackRock and others have followed suit and dialed back at least their public support for ESG initiatives. But if Hughes's aim was to hurt the companies on the black list, he doesn't appear to have been successful. Most of these firms have grown even bigger. Critics of the effort say the people who have been hurt by all of this are Texans. Chris Hollins: So how has your trip to Houston slash Texas been? Amy Scott: It's been good. Yeah, very friendly. __ This is Chris Hollins, the city controller of Houston, Texas. He's an elected official responsible for Houston's $7 billion budget. We met him in his corner office on the eighth floor of City Hall. He's got a Hakeem Olajuwon college jersey on the wall from when the legendary basketball player was at the University of Houston. Chris Hollins: The jersey is Hakeem Olajuwon, but it's signed by the whole team. Amy Scott: Wow. How'd you get that? Chris Hollins: You know, I have my ways. Amy Scott: That's cool. That is cool. But we're here to talk about Senate Bill 13. Has it had an impact on the economy of Texas? Chris Hollins: I believe that it has. Amy Scott: One of the most important things that financial companies like BlackRock do is help towns and cities like Houston borrow money to fix roads or upgrade schools using the bond market. The firms bid for that business, so when a bunch of them get blacklisted for their ESG policies, there's less competition, and that can mean the cities and school districts end up paying more. Chris Hollins: You take economics 101, and you understand that if I'm the only, if I if I'm the only bidder, and I know that, then I can go in with a little bit higher of a price, and you're probably going to say, Yes, right? It lessens our negotiating power, which we know ultimately has that negative impact on on our bottom line. Amy Scott: Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Wharton School studied the impact of anti-ESG legislation in Texas, including Jason Isaac's bill. They estimated that in the first eight months they were in effect, these laws cost the state between $300 and $500 million in higher borrowing costs. Chris Hollins: A huge chunk of what we spend money on is debt service, right? It's paying interest on money that we borrowed and and so all the money that, the millions and millions of dollars that we're paying in interest, that's money that we're not spending on hiring more police officers. It's money that we're not spending on fixing potholes or beautifying our parks to make this a better city to live in and enjoy with your family. So there are real victims here. Amy Scott: Controller Hollins, who's a Democrat, says it's disappointing to see politicians sitting in Austin, hours away, making policies that he feels are harmful to his city. Chris Hollins: And it's even worse when you when you can put like a nice southern drawl on it and sound all, you know, I don't know hokey and kind and whatever, but all you're doing is is just really waking up and going to hurt people every day. Amy Scott: Who have those policies hurt? Can you give some examples? Chris Hollins: The the millions who are being impacted by changes in climate when there are disaster after disaster pummeling our state, especially in the coastal areas. We're the energy capital of the world and just you know, in recent past, we can't keep the lights on during certain natural disasters. Last year, climate related disasters cost Texas between $20 and $50 billion. Amy Scott: When we visited Houston, the city had just been through a deep freeze. Chris Hollins: And the recovery is is getting more and more costly. That little chicken scratch that y'all saw on the table when you came in, it was it was around our disaster recovery costs, which are estimated to be upwards of $200 million just for what happened this past year. Amy Scott: To controller Hollins, the ESG backlash is just another form of climate denial that's delaying action to address the crisis and will cost Texas not just money, but lives in the future. But to conservative lawmakers, it's another front in the broader culture war, another acronym like DEI and CRT, to distort and demonize. After it passed in Texas, Senate Bill 13 became a blueprint for Republican legislators across the country. Dozens of bills in states like Oklahoma, Kentucky and West Virginia have used Jason Isaac's language as a template. It was a targeted coordinated attack that delivered a thousand cuts to the concept of ESG and left it bleeding out in the stairwell. But the lawmakers that wielded the knives weren't operating alone. Turns out, they were hired killers funded by a river of dark money. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: After the break, the tangled web of right wing think tanks and fossil fuel interest groups that funded the plot to kill ESG. [BREAK] Amy Scott: What are some of your favorite slurs that the right has given ESG? Kelly Mitchell: Oh, that's a fun question. Amy Scott: Like woke capital is one, woke capitalism. Kelly Mitchell: Woke capitalism might be my favorite, just because it's so kind of absurd on the face. Like nothing BlackRock is doing is woke. Amy Scott: This is Kelly Mitchell. We heard from her in episode one. She's executive director of the investigative watchdog group Fieldnotes, and she's been following the anti-ESG backlash since the very beginning. If Kelly was the lead investigator in our ESG murder mystery, she'd have an evidence board in her office with red yarn connecting pictures with suspects that would take up the entire wall, maybe even several rooms. But what Kelly's tracking isn't just the people and the organizations who delivered a thousand cuts to ESG, it's the money and power behind them. And there are really two main sources of money, the business folks and the culture warriors. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: These are the people and the groups in the shadows that paid for the knives that policy makers wielded against ESG. Kelly Mitchell: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a long time recipient of oil money, most notably from the Koch brothers and Koch Industries. Amy Scott: The Texas Public Policy Foundation is the conservative think tank where Jason Isaac worked when he wrote Senate Bill 13. According to climate research firm Pleiades Strategy, over the last 10 years, the think tank has received about $13 million from foundations linked to Koch, Inc., the big conglomerate that's deeply involved in oil and gas. Another funder is oil and gas tycoon Bud Brigham. Bud Brigham: I found the Texas Public Policy Foundation to be a very effective think tank for the principles that I believe in. So I have invested over the years with them quite a bit. Amy Scott: We reached out to Bud because he's been gunning for ESG for years. Back in 2021 he published a white paper with the Texas Public Policy Foundation called "Energy discrimination: a threat to capitalism, prosperity and flourishing." In his paper, he questions accepted climate science and calls ESG a cancerous threat to our way of life. Bud Brigham: The ESG movement, it became apparent that it was like DEI, a Trojan horse for these political movements, in this case, to co-opt companies away from oil and natural gas by those that view it as detrimental, and so I felt like I needed to stand up for capitalism. Amy Scott: Bud Brigham's ideas influenced Jason Isaac, who wrote Senate Bill 13. Ideas that through that white paper and Jason's legislation began to spread across the country. Since 2021, legislators have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills in 40 states. That's again, according to Pleiades Strategy. 48 of those bills, so a little over 10%, became law, some modeled after Jason Isaac's bill. Others taking a different approach, but each one sliced away at ESG with the help of the people in the shadows. Kelly Mitchell: As this fight has grown, there have been a number of other groups, other major dark money players, that have stepped in to take advantage of the momentum. Amy Scott: Dark money is, by its nature, hard to track, but some familiar names are tacked up on Kelly's evidence board. Kelly Mitchell: Some of those include groups that are backed by Leonard Leo, most famous for basically shaping Trump's Supreme Court. Through his various affiliates, he's poured millions of dollars into this anti-ESG movement with the goal of crushing liberal dominance and really taking on the quote woke left and woke capitalism. Amy Scott: Groups backed by Leo, a conservative lawyer, include the nonprofit Consumers Research, which funds the State Financial Officers Foundation, an organization of Republican State Treasurers and auditors. Another big player in the backlash is the Heritage Foundation, whose fellow Andy Puzder, former fast food CEO, had this to say about ESG. Andy Puzder: ESG investing is socialism in sheep's clothing, and this is, this is the challenge of your generation. My father's generation's challenge was the Nazis. Amy Scott: Puzder was speaking at a workshop about ESG. The investigative watchdog Documented, where Kelly used to work, got hold of this recording, which was first verified and aired by the program Here and Now. Andy Puzder: The challenge of your generation is ESG investing, and it's more insidious than communism or the Nazis. Kelly Mitchell: I don't even know how to respond to that, but I think it does speak to the hyperbolic nature and the fear mongering that's come along with something as simple as like evaluating risk. Amy Scott: This is just a fraction of the suspects on Kelly's board, which is actually a PDF put together by her and her colleagues. It's a tangled web of think tanks, advocacy groups, corporations and oil and gas trade associations, including the Heartland Institute, Heritage Action for America, American Petroleum, Independent Women's Forum, Capital Research Center, American Legislative Exchange Council, America First Policy Institute. And many, many more. ___ Yes, it kind of makes your head spin, doesn't it? Kelly Mitchell: It does make my head spin. Amy Scott: We've got oil billionaires and Republican treasurers, anti-woke pundits and climate deniers. And what's even more baffling about all this is that the thing they're so afraid of, this so-called woke capitalist threat to fossil fuels, doesn't seem to be doing what its critics think it's doing. In fact, last year, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever has. Kelly says part of the problem with ESG is that it's so poorly defined. To critics on the right, it's part of an activist plot to bring down the fossil fuel industry, but to critics on the left, it's not doing nearly enough to actually address the climate crisis. Kelly Mitchell: In part because we don't really have the tools to distinguish green washing and empty promises from real, long term commitments. Amy Scott: And in some ways, that vagueness has left ESG open to attack. Kelly Mitchell: The death of ESG, if we're going to call it that, is really complicated. It's morphed into this buzzword that can now mean anything to anybody, and so identifying a single culprit is quite difficult here. Amy Scott: But the backlash has had a chilling effect. Big firms are leaving net zero initiatives in droves. Investment in ESG funds has fallen in each of the past three years. CEOs have scrubbed the letters ESG from their websites and public speeches, and maybe the final nail in the coffin, the SEC just dropped efforts to require companies to disclose climate related risks. So is ESG dead? Kelly Mitchell: The buzz word ESG may be dead. The movement has succeeded in, unfortunately, turning it into something quite politically charged and toxic. But the underlying principles are incredibly durable because they're based in reality. The truth is the world will decarbonize. The truth is that climate disasters are increasing in their frequency and their severity. Smart investors will continue to look at those risks. They will evaluate those risks, and they will price it into their investment decisions. They're probably just not going to do it under the banner of ESG. Amy Scott: Okay, so maybe the body of ESG is buried six feet under but that doesn't mean its spirit doesn't live on. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. So they're virtue signaling to us, but in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Next episode, the evolution, or maybe reincarnation, of ESG.

More Lucas via AFP) (Photo by RICCARDO MILANI/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock has risen 12% over the past five days due to two key developments: a broader market rebound after President Trump suspended reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, and the company’s announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program. Despite the recent gains, AVGO is still down over 20% this year. Such fluctuations are not unusual for the stock—AVGO fell 36% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn and dropped 48% during the COVID-19-related market selloff in 2020. However, for investors seeking a potentially more stable and high-performing alternative, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks with a strong record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Broadcom’s key financial indicators highlight its strong foundation: For long-term investors, the recent decline in AVGO stock could offer a compelling entry point, considering the company’s solid fundamentals and AI leadership. Those sensitive to volatility should consider hedging, consulting a financial advisor, or diversification, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark to produce strong returns for investors.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Shock and the China Supply Chain

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access We are now in a trade war with China, and the only question is: How long before Trump (and America) blink? A month after my last piece in The Nation, its essentials—on DOGE, the tax cuts, Pentagon spending, falling oil prices, and, above all, the tariffs, look pretty good. I judged that Mexico and Canada would get off fairly easy, that China would return blow for blow. At first it seemed I’d guessed wrong about Vietnam and other Asian countries’ escaping the heavy hit. But then Trump backed away from his absurd “reciprocal tariff” scheme. That retreat was prompted by a wobble in the bond market and the dollar. In past crises, even when US policies were at fault—as was the case during the subprime mortgage debacle—investors rushed into US Treasury bonds and bills as the safe haven. This time they moved out. Japanese insurance companies may have led that move, in an act of self-defense that hit the money men where it hurts—and showed the limits of Trump’s power. The “pause” is provisional until July 8. By then, the economic picture and the politics of tariffs may be entirely different than they are today. Trump still claimed success, reporting that more than 75 countries had come around to “kiss [his] ass,” including offers to cut their tariffs on US goods to zero. Since for many countries those tariffs were already low, while others cannot afford much of what America still exports, this costs them little and promises few gains to American firms. But along with, say, a few arms contracts or soybean shipments, it may be enough to keep the tariff wolf from their door. China does not bend. It does not bow or kneel. This has been a bedrock principle of Chinese policy since the revolution. No one inclined to grovel before any foreign power can become a leader in China, and any Chinese government that wavered on the point would be swept away by popular anger—yes, even in China. China also has a living history of hardship far greater than anything Americans can remember. The Chinese can and will take what comes. So, we are in a trade war and the only question is: How long before Trump (and America) blink? The first pressure points for political pain are the stock and bond markets; the second is upcoming elections. The broad scenario is familiar since 2008—falling prices leading to financial crisis, followed by bailout, deep recession, and ultimately emergency measures to get the economy moving again. However, that was then. The Bush and Obama regimes had enough self-preserving instinct to resort to Keynesianism under stress—as did Trump himself, when faced with Covid in 2020. But in the new libertarian order, and with Trump (presumably) barred from reelection, extreme Musk-and-Mellon-ism may instead prevail this time—even if the Democrats score gains next year. A third potential pressure point could hurt even more. Consider America’s supply chain: Amazon, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. These firms have built the most brutally efficient funnel for the distribution of goods ever seen. Many of those goods—by no means all, but many—come from China. Many are produced in the US and in other countries. But all merge into the same chain, to which, for many millions of Americans, there are now few if any alternatives. To apply an argument from my new book, Entropy Economics, efficiency is achieved by large fixed investments, which then permit unit costs to fall as volume increases and quality improves. This was Henry Ford’s famous formula for the Model T, replicated over more than a century in every sector and domain. It is the American System. America’s distribution system—for all its aesthetic and moral defects—is merely the latest and one of the greatest applications of Ford’s principle. But highly efficient, high-fixed-cost business structures are fragile. When their variable costs go up, their volume shrinks and their profits can fall sharply, since they must still cover their fixed costs. Profits quickly turn into losses. Firms with high fixed costs can run losses only until their reserves are exhausted—at which point breakdown and bankruptcy follow. Adjustment does not occur by magic as textbooks claim; it is a slow, painful process—if it occurs at all. Trump’s tariffs on China, leaving aside those on the rest of the world, raise variable costs. If the tariffs wipe out the profits of Chinese suppliers—very likely in many cases, since Asian profit rates are low—they will cease to ship to the United States. A drop in volume will hit the profits of the distribution network. As profits fall, parts of that network may begin to fail. If the large stores and on-line warehouses start to shut, there will be no channel left with sufficient capacity to deliver non-Chinese goods, including those made in the United States, to the vast consumption market that is the American working and middle class. Without access to their own customers, American producers will also begin to fail. Emma Jackson Jeet Heer Books & the Arts / Mark Chiusano Saree Makdisi The last great crisis, Covid-19, broke the supply chain—but only temporarily. It could be repaired, rerouted, and restored. Beyond that, Covid hit services hardest. Services have relatively low fixed costs. They shrink, and then, eventually, they (mostly) recover. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 hit housing: It destroyed values, displaced millions through foreclosure, and depressed construction. But homeowners who were not displaced—the vast majority—suffered mainly paper losses and life went on. Home-building is also an industry with a high proportion of variable costs, and ultimately the housing sector began to recover. Distribution is different—and all Americans need to eat every day. They rely on the high-fixed-cost supply chain for daily purchases, including food and many other items produced in the US and around the world. If the distribution network starts to fail, Americans could be deprived not only of Chinese goods but of all goods. The pain gauge will go up and up. A Soviet-style shortage economy might emerge—and this can happen quite quickly, as the pandemic briefly showed. With serious shortages, the “stimulus” reflex is counterproductive: More money will bring longer lines and higher prices. One might run the distribution system at a loss, via bailouts and subsidies for the “critical infrastructure” that is provided by the operating firms. But it is hard to imagine how either happens, at scale, consistent with a stable dollar. If the value of the dollar continues to fall, the price of everything (imported and home-made) will rise even more. The Federal Reserve will then face a choice between supporting the infrastructure subsidies or jacking up interest rates to protect the dollar (and “fight inflation,” as they will call it). That dynamic, once started, works against recovery. It is also possible, as the free-market evangelists surrounding Trump seem to hope, that the problem will be solved by massive waves of new business investment, reviving domestic industry, reshoring supply chains and decentralizing distribution, all very quickly in the teeth of inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, and business bankruptcies. When pigs fly. It is naturally also possible that our leader will again reverse course, declare victory, and try to restore the status quo ante, with the usual flattery directed at Xi Jinping. On smartphones and computers, the two largest imports from China, he already did just that, late on a Friday night, evidently to save Apple. By the time he gets around to blinking on the rest, our onetime Chinese partners may have reassessed the value to themselves of their relationship with us and moved on. Good luck getting them back. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Google Stock: A Compelling Buy Under $160

More in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on March 12, 2025. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Question: Why pay 34x earnings for Amazon stock when you can buy Google stock for just 19x? That’s a tough sell—especially when you consider three straightforward reasons: However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. While Google may not fit the mold of a traditional “safe haven,” its track record during market disruptions is worth considering. The stock declined 45% during the 2022 inflation shock and 31% amid the Covid-19 downturn, showing that it is still prone to volatility. However, the stock has already seen a significant correction, dropping from over $205 to under $160 now. This decline implies that much of the downside could already be factored in. With widespread belief that Artificial Intelligence represents a transformative, long-term growth theme, Google may offer a compelling case at its current valuation. Although both Amazon and Google provide AI infrastructure, Google’s real strength lies in its groundbreaking AI research and the seamless integration of that technology into products like Search and YouTube. This unique combination of innovation and massive reach positions Google favorably for continued AI-led growth. Naturally, investing in Google isn’t risk-free. There’s always a chance earnings might miss estimates or that growth could decelerate. Additionally, unpredictable events could adversely affect the stock. Investors should be prepared for potential volatility—including the possibility of a 30% decline from current levels. That said, for long-term investors with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a “buy-and-hold” strategy, Google’s current valuation might present a worthwhile entry point. For those with lower risk tolerance, a hedged approach within a diversified portfolio, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark, might offer a smoother ride while still capturing potential upside. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The changes in embassies, the squabbling over taxis, the blue knives, the unpaid (of the proud Left, of course) and President Salmas

Hello, I don’t know how many of you are at work today or have already started your Easter holidays, but a good parliamentary source told me that “if you see an MP not elected in Attica wandering around here in the afternoon, you can poke a hole in my nose…” Look, let’s not kid ourselves, being a member of parliament is not exactly the most… intense job in the world. Anyway, today there’s a KYSEA meeting, they’ll discuss Dendias’ armament issues, they won’t discuss the cable (it’s Easter after all), and there’s also an issue with Chrysochoidis, the extension of the fence, which everyone wants – including the minister of course – but, from what I understand, there’s no money. And after Easter Tuesday… Changes in ambassadors Significant changes in the country’s diplomatic representation abroad are marked by this year’s decisions on ambassador-level transfers. What stands out, of course, is the transfer of E. Sekeris, who is Greece’s Permanent Representative to the UN, at a time when the Greek presidency will last until 2026. His replacement will struggle to find rhythm in the particularly complex role of representing Greece at the UN Security Council. Also notable is the transfer of Aik. Nasika from the Embassy in Washington, as she hasn’t even completed two years since her appointment, and at a time when it’s extremely critical for the Greek embassy to reestablish ties with the “Trump system.” Ambassador N. Garilidis is also being transferred from the Embassy in Tripoli, at a time when relations with Libya require particular attention. New ambassadors will also be appointed to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi — particularly important posts, as our foreign policy is focused on both the Arab world and the Gulf countries. At the Metropolis (God bless us) Mitsotakis These are holy days, and churches are in the spotlight. I’ve heard that on Holy Thursday, Mitsotakis will go to the Metropolis of Athens to hear Archbishop Ieronymos officiate the Passion Service, and afterward he’ll take the ferry to Tinos, where he’ll spend the holy days (returning on Easter Monday). The attempt to reconnect with the Church is more than obvious, after all, ND’s losses to its right flank are not negligible. Just the other day, Mitsotakis was with the Archbishop at the Student Dormitory of the Apostolic Ministry in Agia Varvara, and last year as well he had attended the Metropolis on Holy Thursday. Back then it was a big deal, since the aftershocks of the same-sex marriage law hadn’t yet subsided. “Squabbling” over taxis Yesterday’s SATA strike over the right of taxis to enter bus lanes while loaded has political “tails” as well. It’s no coincidence that SATA generally had a good relationship with former Deputy Transport Minister Vasilis Oikonomou, whom President Lymberopoulos referred to as the “father of taxis.” Oikonomou, who was handling the new Highway Code — which is currently out of Public Consultation and in the General Secretariat of the government — had found a formula by including a provision that loaded taxis could enter bus lanes, but only after a traffic study was conducted and a ministerial decision was issued. Then came the cabinet reshuffle, Oikonomou left, the Highway Code stalled, and taxi drivers were left in limbo. Meanwhile, the new Deputy Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis is “running” with the trains and doesn’t appear immediately inclined to satisfy the taxi drivers’ request, while his relationship with Lymberopoulos has been stormy since the “battle” over the operations of Uber and Taxibeat. A few days ago, Kyranakis said that the new Highway Code would come to Parliament, but it remains to be seen what will happen with the controversial provision and whether it will remain as Oikonomou drafted it or be modified. Oikonomou, for his part, tells his associates that he’s done the work and it would be pointless to “rip it out.” Sharpening the “blue” knives You got a sense of what’s coming when the provisions for surrogate motherhood are introduced in Parliament from the informal yet intense dialogue between “blue” MPs and the Maximos Mansion that began in our dark column. The parliamentarians who had opposed the same-sex marriage bill now argue that developments fully vindicate their earlier observations. A government source responded that the provisions don’t close any “back doors” opened by the marriage equality law, but by an earlier law from 2014 under Samaras. The MPs return today, refute the government source, and refer to the new Floridis provision. The regulation, they say, stipulates that gender does not constitute an incapacity to gestate. In other words, a male couple — whose rights were equalized by the marriage equality law — cannot invoke medical incapacity in order to have a child via surrogate. Whether this new regulation will withstand legal challenges remains to be seen. Salmas like Tsitouridis? I told you last week that independent MP Marios Salmas wants to start a party — he’s thinking it through and working on it. His presence at Argyris Dinopoulos’ book event a few days ago might signal the kind of audience he’s targeting, and he might “play ball” with former allies of his, like the titan of politics Nikos Nikolopoulos, who’s currently politically homeless. Salmas isn’t talking with Latinopoulou (who’s rushing to organize her own party), but wouldn’t it be something if he also reached out — just in case — to another “former,” Savvas Tsitouridis, who launched the (unforgettable) party “Radicals” and scored 0.16% in the 2019 European elections? The tender, the Parliament restaurant, and gourmet dishes courtesy of… Mitsotakis Remember when Kostas Tasoulas was moved from Parliament to the Presidential Mansion and many started saying that Metsovo cheeses would also disappear from Parliament? I’m here to tell you that this moment is near, as a tender for a new contractor for the Parliament’s restaurant and main cafés will be launched soon. These spots usually go to whoever offers the lowest prices on a specific list of products, but — almost always — the contractor turns out to be from the President’s hometown. Let me also tell you that among the key obligations of the new leaseholder is to retain the existing staff. Random detail: the chef who has curated the restaurant’s gourmet dishes in recent years (and has dramatically upgraded the menu) is named Mitsotakis and is a very distant relative of the Prime Minister. Kasselakis, Famelos — same difference for the workers of Avgi and Kokkino The ordeal…and the mockery for the workers of Avgi and Kokkino continues, as not only are they still unpaid, but as time passes, they’re starting to realize that Socrates Famelos is turning out to be an even worse employer than Kasselakis. Let me explain: on Holy Monday, another three-way meeting took place involving the representative of the workers in the party’s media outlets, the SYRIZA president, and a representative from the journalists’ union ESIEA. The main topic was the timeline for the repayment of two unpaid salaries and the party leadership’s plans for the future of these “shops.” However, instead of offering even new promises, Famelos told the unpaid workers that they’ve received enough already, while their peers in other outlets have been unpaid for months (?). He added that he will proceed with taking out a loan to pay a quarter of the money owed and made it clear that “for the next two months, there’s not a single euro.” Why we got 16 Exocet (and not 24 or 32) The visit last Monday of Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu to Athens brought new developments in Greek-French relations, which had seen some fluctuations recently, mainly due to the Meteor missiles and Turkey’s attempt to acquire them. The French minister – and almost prime minister – finalized the procurement of 16 modern guided missiles MM40 Exocet Block 3C. Now, if someone wonders why 16 and not 24 or 32, the answer is simple. The procurement of these specific missiles was approved last December at a cost of 33 million euros and is intended for the two latest missile boats (Roussen-class) “Karathanasis” and “Vlachakos” that the Hellenic Navy received from the Elefsis Shipyards. These specific warships have 8 “cells” from which the Exocet missiles are launched. Essentially, the Navy acquired the “payload,” as it is called, for each ship. After all, other ships of the same class also carry Exocet missiles, with the difference being that they have older versions. Beyond that, in any case, one cannot underestimate the fact that the French “released” the most modern version with a range of 200 km and clearly greater capabilities, at a critical time with ongoing tensions in the broader region. Moreover, as we mentioned above, it has been announced that the KYSEA will convene today, where the 12-year armament program will be discussed, as well as Nikos Dendias’ proposal for the acquisition of a 4th Belharra frigate. It is certain that the issue of armaments will have much continuity and many interesting “episodes” in the near future. GEK TERNA’s post-Easter gifts The GEK TERNA stock is once again heading full speed toward a capitalization of 2 billion euros, with trading intensifying even during “light” “pre-holiday” sessions like yesterday’s. The reason for the investment interest may be revealed at the end of the month, on April 28, when GEK TERNA will publish its 2024 results and investors will learn the final benefit from the transaction with Masdar, which acquired TERNA ENERGY. If market information proves accurate, the profit from the sale is significant, which means the benefit (dividend) for shareholders will also be significant… Eurobank bets on Prosperty to sell 2,000 properties Having raised 7 million euros in funding since its founding in 2020 from investment funds such as Velocity Partners, Metavallon, BigPi, as well as family offices, the Greek real estate tech platform Prosperty is entering its next phase following Eurobank’s entry into its share capital. The bank, which is acquiring a 25% stake in the PropTech company, aims with this move to manage and promote its properties more effectively, but the move is also linked to the “My Home II” program. Overall, by the end of the year, it is estimated that the total number of Eurobank-owned properties on the Prosperty platform will increase to at least 2,000. What is interesting, however, is why Prosperty was chosen, and one of the reasons has to do with the technology developed by the company, which has created a comprehensive ecosystem of services and tools that simplify property management and commercialization, while it has also developed a B2B SaaS solution, ProspertyOS, for institutional investors, asset managers, and banks, offering complete property portfolio management and monetization. Athens is more optimistic than other markets Futures contracts on the Derivatives Market will close this week on Thursday, not on Good Friday. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s doesn’t acknowledge Easter holidays and will issue its rating on the Greek economy on Good Friday; a favorable score is expected to be followed by an upgrade for Greek banks. With that in mind, a few bold investors showed up yesterday, ready to place the “Good Friday bet,” ignoring the fact that our market will remain closed for four days amid ongoing geopolitical turbulence. The signal came early from National Bank (+6.43%) at €9.274, with trades worth €35 million—clearly not from retail investors. Piraeus (+3.45%) at €4.80, Eurobank (+2.58%) at €2.39, and Alpha (+2.22%) at €2.161 followed. The truth is that trading volume intensified in the final hour of the session, but total transactions did not exceed €150 million, with €18 million in block trades. For the fourth consecutive session, the General Index closed in positive territory, yesterday at the day’s high of 1,656.48 points, up +1.89%. Overall, in four sessions, the General Index has gained over +8.3%. The Stassinopoulos Group was once again in the spotlight, with VIOHALCO (+5.07%) at €5.39, Cenergy (+2.54%), and ELVALHALCOR (+2.61%). OTE (+2.53%) reached a market cap of €6.5 billion, but was surpassed by OPAP, which with a smaller rise (+0.69%) is now approaching a market cap of €7 billion and a stock price of €19. The turmoil strengthens the balance sheet of HELEX Over the last seven sessions, regardless of market fluctuations, HELEX’s stock has recorded gains of about +11.5%. These ups and downs—high market volatility—generate increased revenue for Hellenic Exchanges. HELEX is a company with a market value of €316.2 million and cash reserves of approximately €70 million. As of yesterday, the average daily transaction value on the Stock Exchange appears to be up +40% compared to the same period last year. All these transactions generate commissions for HELEX, which also benefits from an 18% increase in market capitalization. HELEX’s management announced that—for the 2024 fiscal year—it will distribute a dividend of €0.29/share, up 21% from last year. The stock’s dividend yield exceeds 5%. ONYX seeks transfer to the main market of the ASE On May 10, the management of ONYX Tourism will submit an application to transfer to the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. This will follow its application for participation in the Recovery Fund and the Strategic Investments Plan (ESCHASE), in collaboration with Deloitte, for its ambitious €180 million investment next to Sani in Halkidiki. After the approvals, a major and equally ambitious capital increase is planned for the fall, led by Vigor AΧΕΠΕΥ (of Nikos Kontaroudis) and Pantelakis Securities. The market value of the former MED, now ONYX Tourism, has surpassed €84 million, with institutional portfolios currently holding a 6% stake in the company. 100,000 contracts passed…through the AI scanner A quiet revolution is taking place behind the scenes at the Hellenic Cadastre. In order to manage the ever-increasing volume of transactions and the hundreds of thousands of contracts it “inherited” from the now-defunct mortgage offices, the agency had, until recently, relied primarily on the assistance of external lawyers, at a cost of 15 euros per file. Since September 2024, Artificial Intelligence has entered the scene forcefully, and—as we hear—official announcements are expected next week: More than 100,000 contracts have been legally reviewed at lightning speed and at a cost of less than 0.13 euros each. The savings for the public sector already exceed 1.5 million euros, while transaction processing is now much faster, given that in Athens it used to take up to 2 years to process a single contract. Delphi goes…to Iraq The agreement was finalized over the weekend, following a meeting between the Deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Qubad Talabani, the Greek Minister of National Defense, Nikos Dendias, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible for Economic Diplomacy and Extroversion, Tasos Hatzivasileiou. During these meetings, it was decided—and Symeon Tsomokos immediately agreed—that one month from now, on May 16 and 17, a Delphi Economic Forum will be organized in Iraqi Kurdistan. Under intense time pressure, the technical details are being handled by the Secretary General for International Economic Relations and Extroversion, Dimitris Skalkos, who will lead the Greek business delegation. D. Trump seeks Jerome Powell’s replacement U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent is making it clear: the administration is already considering who will succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and interviews with candidates will begin in the fall. The American central banker warns that tariff policies will lead to price increases, inflation, and recession. The dollar interest rate cuts that President Trump so strongly desires in order to boost investment appeal in the U.S. might not be the right remedy. Markets are watching the clash and are selling off bonds—not only in the U.S. but also in Japan. The yield on Japan’s 30-year government bonds has surged since the fateful day of April 2nd, rising by 33 basis points—to its highest level in the last 19 years—while the U.S. 30-year yield rose by 29 basis points over the same period. The U.S. 10-year bond is yielding 4.37%, the German 2.54%, the French 3.29%, and the Greek 3.43%. At the same time, in the stock markets, hedge funds are clearing stocks from their portfolios. Goldman Sachs recorded that in March, hedge funds executed the most aggressive stock sell-off (not just U.S. equities) since 2013. Not even during the pandemic crisis of 2020 was such a sharp reduction in equity positions by hedge funds recorded. When short-term professional market speculators sell in a hurry, temporary upticks—especially in the lead-up to the Easter holidays—might not matter all that much. Explore related questions

(NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

(NASDAQ: QUBT), Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the QCI class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/QUBT Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR) Class Period: August 2, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 23, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes; (2) Atkore reaped significant, unsustainable financial benefits from its anticompetitive conduct; (3) as Atkore's price-fixing scheme was exposed, the Company and its price-fixing co-conspirators were no longer able to artificially inflate the price of PVC Pipes, resulting in a substantial decrease in the price of PVC Pipes; (4) Atkore's business and operations were negatively impacted; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. For more information on the Atkore class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ATKR Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:RKLB) securities during the period November 12, 2024, through February 25, 2025 (“the Class Period”). [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further.

April 15, 2025 18:33 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart Santa Clara, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santa Clara, California - In February 2025, Meta made headlines by increasing its hiring of engineers, with interview requests surging in that period. As Meta and other top-tier tech companies continue to invest in user experiences, front-end engineering has become a critical area of hiring. Engineers who specialize in crafting fast, responsive, and accessible interfaces are more essential than ever. To learn more visit https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/front-end-engineering-interview-masterclass This hiring spike comes at a time when the broader tech industry is recovering and recalibrating after a wave of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Against this backdrop, Interview Kickstart has updated its Front-End Engineering course for professionals aiming to break into FAANG and other top-tier companies. Designed and taught by current engineers and hiring managers at FAANG+ companies, the course provides a rigorous, structured path to mastering the technical and interview skills that top employers demand. The demand for engineers with front-end expertise is rising steadily, especially for those skilled in modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. According to a 2024 report from the Burning Glass Institute, front-end developer job postings have grown at an average rate of 15% per year since 2020. Companies are prioritizing candidates who not only know JavaScript and CSS inside out but also understand system design, user performance optimization, and cross-platform delivery. Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course covers core fundamentals with an emphasis on data structures and algorithms, a must-have for technical interviews at any elite tech company. Over 5 weeks, learners engage in live classes focused on solving algorithmic challenges, understanding time and space complexity, and approaching problems with optimal solutions. This forms the technical backbone required for any engineer, regardless of specialization. Beyond that foundation, the program includes a dedicated three-week system design module. While many front-end engineers often overlook system design, it is increasingly tested in interviews, particularly for mid-level and senior candidates. The course teaches how to design scalable front-end systems, from rendering pipelines to caching strategies and distributed UI components, which are essential for roles at companies like Meta where products operate at a massive scale. The four-week front-end domain segment focuses on the exact tools, frameworks, and architectures used in modern front-end development. Topics include virtual DOM, component-based design, state management with Redux or Context API, performance optimization, testing, and accessibility, which are all covered through real-world case studies and problems modeled after actual interview questions. Classes are structured around open-ended problems and live feedback, helping participants understand not just how to solve a problem, but how to communicate their thought process effectively during an interview. What sets the Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course apart is its career-focused layer. Interview Kickstart provides 6 months of post-program support, including mock interviews with experienced engineers from companies like Google and Apple. These interviews are tailored to front-end roles and simulate the pressure and structure of actual technical interviews. Participants receive detailed feedback on both technical and behavioral performance. There are also dedicated sessions for resume building, personal branding, and LinkedIn optimization to ensure candidates stand out to recruiters and hiring managers. The course is built with working professionals in mind. Each week includes asynchronous foundational content, a timed test and review session, and a four-hour live class on Sundays. Between Monday and Wednesday, learners work on practice problems and attend doubt-clearing sessions, with continuous access to instructors for 1:1 coaching. The program recommends 10–12 hours per week for full participation, balancing structure with flexibility. As companies like Meta increase hiring for engineering teams, and as user experience becomes an even bigger differentiator in product strategy, the need for well-prepared, technically sharp front-end engineers is only going to grow. Interview Kickstart's Front-End Engineering Interview Masterclass offers a direct path to capitalize on this demand. By combining top-tier instruction, real-world practice, and structured interview coaching, the program helps engineers not only improve their skills but translate them into high-paying roles at the companies shaping the future of tech.

Title: How To Begin A WordPress Blog: A Step-By-Step Guide For Beginners

Share this article 7 Day Free Trial. Cancel Anytime. Blogging helps people express their views, opinions and insights online. Many newcomers aim to start their own site yet hesitate because they fear all the implicit technical barriers or worry about managing costs and expenses. Over time, however, platforms have adapted to match the capabilities and needs of beginners, making it simpler to get started than ever before. The following article reveals each step in setting up a WordPress blog, from picking a theme to using plugins for security and performance. Keep reading to find out how to establish your site in a straightforward manner. Before purchasing a domain or signing up for a host, it helps to think through the subject you plan to cover. A personal website can revolve around travel, cooking, product reviews, music, or any hobby that sparks your curiosity. Sticking with an area of genuine interest encourages consistent writing, which helps an audience grow. Beginners often question how specific their chosen subject should be. If a person launches a site devoted to music, for instance, they could lose track of unique angles or competition from existing publishers. Those who narrow their scope, such as focusing on a single genre or target demographic, often see steadier growth in an audience. The next step is reflecting on a name that is easy to recall, with keywords related to the topic. Reserving an available domain matching that concept means visitors will likely recognize the subject and return. A blog name typically aligns with the domain. If a blogger chooses âHelenâs Pastriesâ as a name, they might select helenspastries.com as the address, presuming it is not taken. People can verify availability on sites that offer domain searches (Dynadot, Namecheap, GoDaddy, Name.com), or hosting providers that suggest similar names. Lengthy domain names with punctuation can be more difficult to remember, so try to keep it short and to the point. After picking a domain, the next step involves selecting a host. Hosts store files, databases, and media for your blog on servers so visitors can access them around the clock. Well-known providers like Hostinger, SiteGround, and Bluehost offer beginner packages. Low-tier shared plans usually offer one-click WordPress installation and a free Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. That helps maintain smooth loading and safe data exchange. Many packages include a free domain registration for a year, lowering setup costs further. These approximate prices reflect promotional rates, which can shift by season. Each plan typically includes email addresses and 24/7 support. Over time, upgrading to a higher tier might be wise if traffic surges. Those searching for fewer steps may opt for WordPress.com, although that path has constraints on customization and monetization options. A self-hosted approach with WordPress.org is more flexible for design control and performance tweaks. After signing up for a hosting plan, installation rarely takes more than a few minutes due to automated setup tools. You can learn more about good hosting providers at The Blog Starter â How to Start a Blog. Hosts vary slightly, but most present a button or installer labeled âInstall WordPressâ in their dashboards. After clicking, the system installs core files, configuring them behind the scenes. When that completes, you receive login credentials for the admin panel, accessible at yourdomain.com/wp-admin.Â Note: If you ever need to install WordPress manually, itâs known for its â5-minute installation.â This involves downloading WordPress from WordPress.org, uploading the files to your server, and running the setup script. However, beginners rarely need to do this thanks to managed hosting tools. After installation, you can log into your WordPress admin dashboard by visiting yourdomain.com/wp-admin and entering the credentials you set. Newer versions of WordPress may prompt you with a setup or welcome wizard to configure the basics. In the WordPress dashboard, go to Settings â General to set your Site Title and Tagline. The title is your blogâs name (displayed in the browser tab and header), and the tagline is a short phrase that describes your site. For example, Site Title: Travel with Amy, Tagline: Adventures around the world. You can change these anytime. Next, configure SEO-friendly URLs (permalinks) from the start. Navigate to Settings â Permalinks and choose the âPost nameâ option for your URL structure. Using the post name (e.g., yourdomain.com/my-first-post) makes links descriptive and human-readable. This structure is considered the best choice for most sites due to its user-friendliness and SEO benefits Some WordPress dashboards automatically enable an SSL certificate to secure traffic. If not, consult the hosting dashboard or contact support to activate SSL. That changes your address to https:// for added data protection. In addition, remove default content, such as the sample post âHello World,â so you can start fresh. Spend a few minutes exploring the WordPress admin dashboard. Key areas include Posts (for blog posts), Pages, Appearance (themes and customization), Plugins, Settings, and Users. Knowing where things are will make the next steps easier.Â Readers appreciate an orderly, attractive layout that helps them find topics. WordPress relies on themes to control colors, fonts, and structural design. A WordPress theme controls your blogâs design, layout, and style. Upon installation, WordPress activates a default theme (which may look plain). Youâll likely want to switch to a theme that matches your style and niche. In your dashboard, go to Appearance â Themes â Add New. You can browse over 7,000 free themes in the WordPress.org repository by popularity, latest releases, or feature filtersâ . Each theme includes a live preview, giving a sense of how titles, menus, and images appear. Popular ones are: Plenty of other themes exist, yet these remain frequent go-tos because of their consistent updates and user forums. When you find a theme you like, use the Live Preview to see how it would look on your site (with placeholder content). Keep in mind the preview is just an example; youâll customize the details later. Once youâre satisfied, click Install, then Activate to apply the theme to your blogâ. With your theme active, navigate to Appearance â Customize (this opens the WordPress Customizer, or Site Editor for some themes). Here you can adjust key design elements: Logo, Colors, Fonts, Headers, Menus, etc. Some newer themes (called block themes) use Full Site Editing, where you edit the whole layout with blocks. If you chose a block theme, the Customizer might be replaced by a Site Editor (under Appearance â Editor). The idea is similar â you can edit headers, footers, and templates visually. Test your new theme on multiple devices or screen sizes. You can resize your browser or use WordPressâs preview options to see how your site looks on mobile and tablet. Responsive themes should automatically adjust, but always verify that text is readable and images scale properly on smaller screens. Remember, though: Customize gradually! You donât have to perfect your design all at once. Get the basics in place (logo, colors, menu) and launch your site. You can always refine the appearance over time. Many successful blogs start with a simple theme and evolve their design as they grow. WordPress plugins add optional features to expand your siteâs capabilities, from SEO tuning to spam detection. To add a plugin, go to Plugins â Add New in your dashboard. You can search for plugins by name or functionality. Always check the pluginâs reviews, active installations, and last updated date to ensure itâs reputable and compatible with your WordPress version. Install and activate the plugin, then configure its settings (many plugins add a menu item or settings page).Â Tip: Try not to go overboard with pluginsâinstall only what you need. Each plugin can potentially affect site speed or security, so quality is better than quantity. The above four categories (SEO, caching, backup, security) cover the essentials for a solid foundation. Â Some must-have plugins stand out: While each plugin delivers a beneficial function, installing too many at once can slow a site down. Stick to core essentials, then expand carefully. Always check that each plugin remains updated, because older versions sometimes contain flaws. A blog can offer more than routine articles. Readers often look for pages like âAbout,â âContact,â and âPrivacy Policy.â These show who you are, how to reach you, and the ways you handle data. Privacy disclosure can prove beneficial if you collect any user details. Once the basic pages are ready, craft your first post.Â Go to Posts â Add New to open the WordPress post editor. Hereâs how to craft your first post: A short piece might suffice as an opener, but regular writing leads to a more engaging site.Â Many bloggers aim to post at least once per week, although that target can vary by schedule. Readers often appreciate consistency, so if you prefer monthly posts, simply keep to that timeline. WordPress can also schedule upcoming posts automatically, which helps maintain momentum. Search engine optimization affects how people discover your site.Â Remember that SEO is a gradual process. You likely wonât rank on the first page of Google overnight, but by consistently applying these practices, your content can gain visibility. See some of the key SEO tips below. On-Page SEO Best Practices: To attract readers from search engines, optimize your content and site structure: Some consider once the theme is applied and posts are published, the job is complete. Yet regular maintenance aids uptime, security, and performance. WordPress and plugin creators issue updates that remove bugs and vulnerabilities. Check the admin panel weekly for update notices. One of the simplest yet most critical security measures is to keep your WordPress core software, themes, and plugins up to date. Updates often include fixes for security vulnerabilitiesâ. In your dashboard, youâll see update notifications whenever a new version is available. Get in the habit of checking for updates regularly (WordPress can also auto-install minor core updates by default). Enable auto-updates for plugins and themes if your site environment allows it, but be cautious â occasionally an update could introduce a compatibility issue. A good practice is to run backups before applying major updates, so you can roll back if something goes wrong. Remove any plugins or themes you arenât using. Inactive plugins and themes can still pose security risks if left on your server.For instance, if you tried out a plugin but decided not to use it, delete it entirely. Similarly, you might switch themes during setup â feel free to delete old themes except one default theme (WordPress requires at least one theme installed). Having fewer add-ons reduces potential vulnerabilities and also makes your site leaner. (Best practice: remove unused plugins/themes or at least keep them updated if you canât remove them During WordPress installation, you set an admin username and password. Make sure your administrator username is unique (avoid the default âadminâ username, as that is the first guess for hackers)â Even though we set up a backup plugin earlier, itâs worth reiterating: maintain regular backups as part of your maintenance routine. Backups not only help with security incidents (like restoring after a hack) but also with any site crash or accidental content deletion. Test restoring a backup at least once (perhaps on a staging site or locally) so you know the process works. Many backup plugins can be set to automatically delete old backups to save space; configure those limits according to your storage capacity. If you enabled comments on your blog posts, check the Comments section in the dashboard periodically. Mark spam comments as spam (your Akismet plugin will catch most). Approve legitimate comments and reply to them to build community. Also, promptly delete any toxic or inappropriate comments to keep your site welcoming. Adjust discussion settings to your comfort â for example, you might require that a comment author has a previously approved comment or that all comments await moderation, which can control spam and troll comments. Part of maintenance is also reviewing your content occasionally. As your blog grows, update older posts if information changes or if you can improve them (this helps SEO and keeps content fresh). Check for broken links with a plugin or online tool (broken external links can frustrate readers and hurt SEO slightly; update or remove any broken links you find). Readers who sense sincerity and accuracy often return. That means double-checking facts, linking to reliable references, and disclaiming if a statement reflects personal experience. Inserting quotes from experts or sources can anchor your words in real-world context. People also appreciate a blog design free from pop-ups or intrusive ads. While ads can generate revenue, excessive promotion early on might frustrate newcomers. Prioritize a stable reading experience so that your site remains inviting. Selecting high-quality images can support your discussions. For instance, a food blog with crisp, properly lit images of completed dishes may gain fans faster. Similarly, a travel blog might feature original photos from trips. Avoid using copyrighted images without permission. Stock photo websites grant licenses for general purposes, so check usage terms before uploading. Over time, blog owners can encourage comments by replying promptly. Readers interested in a topic sometimes have questions, so providing answers fosters engagement. Those interactions can shape future posts or spark ideas for expansions. It also helps to incorporate a contact page or form so that visitors can reach out privately. Sometimes, they want to suggest improvements or ask about collaborations. If you plan on affiliate partnerships or sponsored articles, follow transparent guidelines by disclaiming any benefit. This practice instills trust. Maintaining social presence can further expand a blog. Each new entry can be shared on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. Many readers discover posts through these channels rather than direct searches, so a consistent effort helps you remain visible. Keeping the site up to date means ensuring the theme and plugins stay current. Changes in web standards affect WordPress over time, prompting new features or best practices. If your theme is no longer supported by its developers, or if a plugin remains unmaintained, it might be time to switch. Readers hoping to start a WordPress site can adopt this method for a thorough, well-structured online presence. They begin by settling on a topic and searching for a domain that matches their theme. Selecting a reliable host secures a stable foundation, with automated WordPress installation removing the bulk of the technical load. Next, they pick a theme that looks appealing across various devices. Adding a few essential plugins ensures protection, provides caching benefits, and helps with website optimization. When creating pages, offering an âAboutâ section promotes an authentic connection with visitors, while a âContactâ page enables constructive interaction. That steady building process continues after the first posts go live. Bloggers can keep refining their craft, analyzing traffic data, and seeking feedback to shape subsequent material. Any site worth visiting includes elements like trust, strong style, and clear intent. Posting valuable content on a consistent basis fosters loyal readers. The steps listed here form a reliable approach for beginners who crave a quick start. By investing time in meaningful posts and practicing safe maintenance routines, owners often develop a unique platform that resonates with individuals worldwide.

Title: Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism?

Time Published: 2025-04-15T21:30:00Z

Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism? April 2025 When the Internet outgrew its academic and research roots and gained some prominence and momentum in the broader telecommunications environment its proponents found themselves to be in opposition to many of the established practices of the international telecommunications arrangements and even in opposition to the principles that lie behind these arrangements. For many years, governments were being lectured that the Internet was special, and to apply the same mechanisms of national telecommunications and trade regulations to the Internet might not wreck the entire Internet, but they would surely isolate the nation that was attempting to apply these measures. Within this broad category was the notion that conventional means of conducting trade in services was not applicable to the Internet. While an early mantra of âThe Internet must be free!â quickly foundered when it encountered pragmatic realities of trying to pay the bills, the next mantra of "Don't tax the Internet!" gathered significant momentum. What was meant here was an admonition to governments not to attempt to unduly constrain the flow of data with taxes and related imposts, as such actions applied in a careless manner was likely imperil the future value of the Internet. This was a unique opportunity to take the role of public communications away from the sclerotic and bloated telephone monopolies and apply some of the vibrant innovative energy that was driving the computer industry into the communications realm. But while the Internet might have had some claim to exceptionalism in the 1990s, such a characterisation was unsustainable in the longer term. It was clear by the time of the millennium that the previous regime of national telephone operators and the treaties that governed the international aspects of this global service had been sidelined. The Internet was sweeping all before it and each time it engaged with another sector it appeared to emerge from the encounter as a clear victor. The Internet might still be exceptional, but by the millennium it was recognised that it was not always exceptional in a good way. In 2003 and 2005 the United Nations hosted the two-part World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to try and come to terms with these changes, and ideally to try to ensure that all economies would benefit from this revolution in computing and communications. This WSIS summit was in the context of the emergence of the so-called information society and a recognition of a widening digital divide where richer nations were in an obvious position to exploit the possibilities that opened up with the combination of abundant computation and communications services and thereby amass further wealth, while poorer nations yet again found themselves on the other side of the divide. Far from being a tool to help equalise the inequities in our world by allowing all to access information, education and open global markets for their services, the Internet appeared to be yet another tool to further entrench this divide between rich and poor. The United States was a focal point in these discussions. At the time the Internet was still strongly associated with the United States, and the US had spent much of the previous decade both promoting its benefits and profiting from the revenues flowing into US companies that were early adopters of Internet-based services. This promotion of the Internet and the free flow of information was certainly not without elements of self-interest on the part of the US, as it appeared that the interests of the newly emerging corporate behemoths of the Internet and the geo-political and geo-economic aspirations of the US appeared to have much in common. However, it's often difficult to tackle the larger picture in these large-scale international forums, so it was no surprise to see attention turn to the individual elements that were contained within this picture. One of these elements that became a topic of discussion in its own right was the status of the body that oversaw the Internet's protocol parameters, including the names and IP addresses, that are used as part of the central core of the Internet. This function, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) was originally part of the US Defence Advanced Research Project Agency's funded activities. After a few more changes within the US Government agency landscape responsibility for this function was shifted to a self-funded mode operated by a private sector entity, ICANN, with some level of US engagement remaining in place. This was variously portrayed as a control or as a safeguarding measure. Irrespective of the nature of the motivation, the result was that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of Commerce, oversaw a contract between the US government and ICANN regarding the operation of the IANA function. Perceptions matter, and the lingering perception here was that the Internet was still seen to be essentially under the control of a single sovereign state, the United States. This unique US role was always going to be a problem for other nations. The international telephone and postal networks were governed by international treaty instruments that had been in place for more than a century. To have a single nation state positioned at the apex of this Internet structure was, to say the least, controversial. Naturally this was a major topic in 2003 at the first WSIS gathering. The UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, convened a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG), a grand title which either conflated this topic to an even greater level of prominence or appropriately stated its central importance to the entire set of concerns with the structure of the Internet at the time. Again, opinions vary here. There was no clear consensus coming out of this WGIG activity, and the 2005 WSIS gathering could not reach any form of agreement on this matter. During the WSIS process the US apparently refused to consider any changes to its pivotal role in the management of the Internet's protocol parameters. The WSIS summit eventually agreed on a compromise approach that deferred any determination on this matter and instead decided to convene a series of meetings that would discuss on the underlying policy principles relating to Internet Governance. We saw the inauguration of a series of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) meetings. These forums were intended to be non-decisional forums for all stakeholders to debate the issues. Originally intended to be convened for a period of five years, culminating in the fifth IGF meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2010, it has continued with a further five-year extension of its mandate, and then a ten-year extension, culminating with the forthcoming IGF meeting in Norway at the end of June 2025. Even within its limited objectives of being a forum for little other than talk the IGF would find it challenging to claim universal success in achieving its mission. The IGF did not manage to address the underlying tensions relating to the pivotal position of the US in the Internet. In 2011 we saw the IBSA proposal (called IBSA because of a summit convened by India, Brazil and South Africa) for a UN committee in Internet Related Policy. In 2013, as a reaction to the US surveillance stories being publicly aired on Wikileaks, a number of internet organisations, including ICANN, the RIRs and the IETF released the "Montevideo Statement" calling on the US to step back from its central role. The US surveillance disclosures also appeared to be a major factor in Brazil's sponsorship of the 2014 netMundial initiatives, which also appeared to have the support of ICANN. Once more the call was for the cessation of the US control over the Internet's protocol parameter function. At much the same time Edward Snowden released a set of material that documented how US agencies were undertaking of widespread surveillance using the Internet. These Wikileaks and Snowden disclosures weakened US resolve, and in October 2016 the previously unthinkable happened. The US government signed away its functional role and passed control of the protocol parameter function to an independent ICANN. If the IGF was the forum to discuss the public policy issues related to the privileged position of the US Government with respect to the Internet, then the principle rational for the IGF also finished in October 2016. In theory at any rate the US no longer claimed the ability to place its finger on the scale with respect to the carriage of these matters. On the other hand, this is perhaps a far too narrow a definition of the role and scope of the IGF. The IGF process has managed to gather a more sophisticated shared understanding of the layers within the Internet and the ways in which these various components both share common objectives and create tensions when competing to achieve similar objectives. The elements of carriage networks, consumer devices, servers and service delivery networks, applications, and application behaviours all operate in a semi-autonomous manner. The previous model of the locus of control of an entire service environment sitting within the telephone company within each nation state was not repeated with the Internet. The Internet has exposed each of the various component service activities as discrete activities, and instead of orchestrating these components within the framework of the procurement processes of the larger service entity, a variety of new markets have been exposed: technology standards, fibre and mobile services, computers in all forms from handsets to servers, applications, service providers and content publishers all operate semi-autonomously, and the orchestration of their actions is through markets and market interactions. The Internet is not operated by a single service delivery company, nor is it a defined destination. It is a series of inter-twined markets. The implication for governance processes was profound, and the IGF has managed to both expose this change and steer a constructive path of commentary and dialogue on these changes as they have happened. I'd like to nominate three major themes of national and international interest in today's Internet that have some relevance to the topic of Internet governance. The first is the issues that can still be summarised as the digital divide. There are still the haves and have nots across the full spectrum of our world. The digital divide is as big as it ever was and there is no visible movement in directions that might be able to ameliorate the societal impacts of these changes. If anything, this divide has further broadened in scope. In absolute terms it may be the case that more individuals have some form of internet access than was thought could possibly be achieved even 10 years ago. But today that's still only one half of the world's population, and the other four billion people are isolated from the mainsteam. The divide also operates across other dimensions, including the cost of access, the quality and speed of access, the accessibility of information, the extent to which goods, services and information are accessible using a local language. They all form subtle aspects and not so subtle aspects of digital exclusion. But when we talk of a digital divide we can broaden our view and look at the position of the world's most valuable digital enterprises, namely Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta, which have a market capitalisation of some 12 trillion USD (just before the recent Trump-induced stock meltdown). The aggregate position of these six enterprises is so large and so powerful that everybody else, individuals, corporates and most governments, find themselves on the impotent side of this digital divide. The second theme is also not a new theme, but it has dramatically increased in importance in the past two decades. Its components have various labels, including Cyber Security, Malware, Abuse, Spam and Viruses. It can be summarised in the observation that today's Internet is a toxic place that not only provides haven for various criminal and fraudulent activities but also provides haven for darker actions encompassing the current set of concerns relating to terrorism and cyber-offensive tactics from state-based actors. The uncomfortable observation is that technology-based counter-measures may be failing us and the fabric of our society seems to be very vulnerable to concerted hostile cyber-attack. We've adopted strong encryption in many parts of the environment as a means of protecting users against various forms of organised surveillance, but in so doing we've turned off the lighting that would otherwise expose various acts of malfeasance to our law enforcement bodies. We have had to make some tough decisions about balancing personal privacy and open attribution. But this lack of clear attribution and greater ability to embed communications behind strong encryption means that various forms of policing this digital world have become expensive, frustrating and ultimately very selective in its application. There is also the observation that these digital megaliths have made vast profits from their dominant position, while at the same time they have managed to transfer the costs of large-scale deployment of poor quality software and tools back on the public sector. The third theme lies within the changes occurring within the Internet itself. In recent years we've seen the proliferation of content distribution networks that attempt to position all of the data and services that any user would request as close as possible to the user. It used to be the role of the network to bring the user to the content portal, whereas these days we are seeing content shifting itself ever closer to the user. In and of itself that's a relatively significant change to the Internet. The public carriage component of the Internet is shrinking and being replaced by private feeder networks that service these rapidly expanding Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). The bigger question concerns the residual need for global names and addresses in this CDN-centric environment. The Internet is no longer a telecommunications network that carriers user traffic across a common network. Today's Internet is a content distribution network that is very similar to a television broadcast network where the transmission component is limited to the last mile access network. The essential difference here is that on the Internet each user can define their own program. One possible response to these concerns is the perception that these situations are instances of collective failure of the Internet Governance framework. Allowing the private sector unfettered control of the public communications space has produced very mixed results. Yes, the obsessive concern with catering precisely to what users want has produced a remarkably efficient and capable supply chain that can bring the economies of massive scale to market of a single unit, and this is a modern-day marvel. But at the same time the private sector is largely uninterested in the general health and welfare of the larger environment and the internet appears to be the victim of such collective neglect. The public sector's forbearance with the cavalier attitude shown by various Internet players may be reaching a breaking point. The EU initiative with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a clear signal that the honeymoon with technology is over and various national regimes clearly want to see a more responsible and responsive attitude from these players to public concerns. Doubtless we will continue to see fines being set at levels intended to be eye-watering for even the largest of players. While this measure has the unintended side-effect of eliminating the smaller players from the market and potentially stifling competition, a major public sector goal is to bring some sense of broader social responsibility back to the major players. This regulatory stance will no doubt continue in both the EU and in many other regimes. But is this increased national engagement a failure of the Internet Governance framework or a failure of a more conventional role of public sector regulation of a market? Private corporate entities have a primary duty to their shareholders, and do not necessarily have the same over-arching obligation to the public good. If self-interest and public interest coincide, then that is a wonderful coincidence of fortune, but when they differ, corporate self-interest necessarily wins. It is naive to expect that any messages of constraint and prudence to the private sector would be heeded unless it has the authority of regulatory impost with some form of punitive enforcement measure. If governments are feeling emboldened to enact regulatory measures for an industry that until now enjoyed some level of immunity from conventional social responsibilities, then how do these same governments feel about the actors that look after the elements of Internet infrastructure? The recent erratic moves by the US President to initiate a trade war on a global scale will have far-reaching implications far beyond stock markets and will inevitably include the digital world and what we refer to as Internet Governance. The US moves on the unilateral imposition of tariffs can be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in global trade and open markets by the US, and a resurgence of a theme of strategic national self-reliance in all areas of economic activity, including the digital realm. The question of course is how will others react? This week I saw a notice from a DNS hosting provider relating to hosting Russian domain names: "We are contacting you about a recent communication from the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in Communications and Information Technologies and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor). This relates to the potential future restrictions on foreign hosting providers and the need for domain administrators who use foreign DNS infrastructure to transition to Russian hosting providers listed in the official register." There is a visible concern in many national regimes that large amounts of their digital infrastructure are being operated by foreign enterprises, and by "foreign" it is more often than not simply "US". Today's deregulated digital communications environment is held together by commercial contracts and the extent to which such arrangements can be torn asunder by seemingly erratic US presidential edicts no doubt causes many to lose sleep! In a bad case scenario, can these US entities be coopted to hold a country's digital infrastructure hostage as part of the âartâ of a national trade deal? In the extreme worst-case scenario, can these entities be forced to operate in an overtly hostile and disruptive manner in terms of services provided to foreign entities? What happens in a modern national digital economy when its infrastructure underpinnings are deliberately sabotaged by such entities acting under duress from some form of executive order? The order in which we operate the Internet today is held apart from the conventional treaty body for communications (the International Telecommunications Union, or ITU) because the US administration in the late 1990's under President Clinton led a coalition of friendly economies notably Australia, Canada, Japan, and the EU in supporting the move to recognise a private institution to perform the allocation and administration functions for internet infrastructure elements (notably names and addresses) based on what we came to call "multi-stakeholderism. The US recognition of this form of industry self-regulatory governance was more like an insubstantive veneer for many years, as the US administration (in the guise of the NTIA within the Department of Commerce) performed an oversight role of the root zone of the DNS in the background. However, as we've already noted, the US administration backed out of this oversight role around a decade ago and has largely disengaged, being unwilling to continue to pay the diplomatic price of being the backstop in holding this coalition together in the face of large-scale devaluation of US international diplomatic capital by the Wiki Leaks and Snowden incidents. You could argue that by 2020 the job was done in any case. The "value" of the Internet was tightly held by a small elite of truly massive US enterprises and any role of the US administration to support these enterprises in the international realm was no longer necessary. Other countries have been willing to go along with these arrangements for a variety of reasons - there was the ill-defined promise of digital prosperity and other national communities could benefit from this shift to digital infrastructure as well. But the distribution of wealth and social power in this "new" world is vastly different from the old industrial world. Having valuable digital enterprises domiciled in a nation does not translate to widespread economic prosperity. The digital enterprise does not rely on large workforces, and the immense concentration of wealth often results in inventive efforts to avoid conventional forms of corporate taxation by the state. The issue is that the distribution of this digital wealth is very uneven and while a small clique of individuals may live in an extreme level of opulence, large proportions of domestic populations are disenfranchised and marginalised. Not unsurprisingly, we are now seeing a response to this situation, in the form of a wave of populism gain social power in many national communities: Not just in the US, but in Germany, France, Hungary, the UK and other western economies. Such populism is based in part on restoring an old-world order that "protects" national economies and eschews many forms of globalism. At the moment this is being expressed in various ways in a visible shift to national compartmentalism, not only in limiting the cross-border flow of physical goods through the imposition of punitive tariffs, but in the efforts to contain digital assets and infrastructure roles to national entities, domiciled within national boundaries. Obviously, this is not looking good for the Internet. It is increasingly likely that we will return to an order where international dealings are strictly defined through the use of a myriad of regulations overseen by treaty-based organisations. It's extremely challenging to espouse the benefits of an open multi-stakeholder global communications environment when the dream has been so basely corrupted by the exploitative excesses of the small clique of digital megaliths. The year 2025 is particularly challenging when WSIS+20 is reopening the basic debate about the merits of multi-stakeholderism. âNational Internet Sovreignityâ is a powerful meme these days and multi-lateralism, as compared to multi-stakeholderism, has a seductive appearance of addressing demands for greater levels of national autonomy, particularly in communities where populism is a dominant social force. This debate is taking part in an environment when the change in the stance of the US administration has effectively torn up all the old order. It is unclear as to how (or even whether) the US will continue to expend effort to support multi-stakeholderism, and the erratic record of the US on the recent topic of tariffs lends further credence to the stance that the US in no longer a widely trusted and stable advocate of the benefits of multi-stakeholderism in the international realm. In mid-2024 we saw efforts by others national entities (AUDA for .au, CIRA for .ca, InternetNZ for .nz, and Nominet for .uk) to create a coalition to speak up for mult-stakeholderism (A Technical Community Coalition for Multistakeholderism (TCCM) is evidence of others attempting to fill this clear gap. Notable is the absence of the US. I wish this group well, but it is extremely challenging to make the case that today's international climate is in their favour. Given the huge issues in cyber-vulnerabilities, the entrenched position of US megalithic digital corporates, and the extremely erratic position of the US administration at present, the case that the ideals of the Internet that were espoused in WSIS some 20 years ago, and the promises of multi-stakeholderism in the development of digital economies where everyone benefits are still realistic prospects today is extremely hard to make. Itâs far easier to observe that we gave it a try and Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta should be grateful to us for enabling their rapid rise to global dominance. I can't help but feel very pessimistic about the coming years. The attempt to coopt private enterprises to work in a manner that safeguards the public interest in our common public telecommunications realm has failed, again. It reminds me of Theodore Vail's efforts in the early 20th century to do a deal with the US Congress to bestow on AT&T a monopoly in national telephone services in exchange for an undertaking that the company would act with restraint as an enlightened private sector entity that would act in the national public interest. As it turned out AT&T could not resist itself from exploiting its monopoly position for any more than a decade! It looks like national pressures are calling an end to multi-stakeholderism in Internet Governance, hastened by a tectonic shift in the position of the US in international circles. The most likely direction we will now pursue in Internet Governance is a shift to multi-laterism and an increased role for the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation for the middle-ranked nation states, accompanied by a tumultuous period of US unilaterism. Is this all due to the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election? If there had been different candidates and a different election outcome, would the position we find ourselves be in today be materially different? It seems to me that there are much larger social forces at play that transcend individuals and their actions, however erratic they may be! We are embarking on changes in our society which are as dramatic and even as traumatic as the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century. Such revolutions leave a trail of social dislocation and uncertainty in their wake, and this information revolution is no exception. It is perhaps unsurprising that nation states tend to be more assertive in such situations as they try and mitigate some of the worst excesses of such social disruptions. One side-effect of this increasing nationalistic stance is that various international institutions, both regional and global, tend to be regarded with increasing levels of distrust from these national regimes and from populist national fora. In times of uncertainty and stress nations naturally try to raise the drawbridge and attempt to insulate themselves from such disruptions by asserting greater levels of control within their own national realm. The root cause of all social dislocation is attributed to the actions of foreign bodies and they claim that greater levels of national determinism will restore some aspect of a myth of prior national greatness and prosperity. The industrial revolution was certainly triggered by the refinement of the steam engine, but the social revolution was far larger in scope than the invention of a simple mechanical device. In a similar line of thought, maybe it's not the Internet or its governance that lies at the heart of many of today's issues. Maybe it's the broader issues of our enthusiastic adoption of computing and communications that has formed a propulsive force for widespread social dislocation in today's world.

Major U.S. equities declined slightly Tuesday, a reprieve from the trade-related volatility that has driven significant swings in stocks in recent weeks. Market indexes ticked lower following rallies in the previous two sessions and despite strong earnings reports from some of the nation's largest banks. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, while the Dow lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq ended Tuesday's session with a minor loss of less than 0.1% Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares surged for the second straight session, adding 6.2% on Tuesday to notch the S&P 500's top daily performance. The push higher for Palantir stock followed reports that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) military solution developed by the big data analytic software firm. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) gained 5.1% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a position worth more than $1.5 billion in the IT services provider. People familiar with the matter told Investopedia that Elliott intends to engage with HPE's leadership on potential steps to boost the tech company's value. According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NFLX) executives outlined a set of optimistic objectives at a business review meeting in March. The targets include doubling the company's revenue by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix shares jumped 4.8% ahead of the streaming giant's quarterly earnings report, which is set to be released Thursday afternoon. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, dropped 5.9%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The move lower came after several research firms reduced their price targets on the stock. Analysts pointed to numerous factors behind more muted forecasts for Albemarle, including the potential for trade tensions to weigh on global sales in the automotive sector, which could result in sustained pressure on prices for battery components. Bank of America expressed a cautious view of the chemical sector, pointing to softness in cyclical demand and headwinds related to global trade. Analysts indicated that these factors are contributing to lower levels of confidence around upcoming earnings estimates. BofA downgraded Dow (DOW) stock to "underperform" from "buy," and shares of the chemicals giant lost 4.0% following the double downgrade. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) sank 3.8% after Baird analysts downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." According to the analyst team, companies in the managed care and health care facilities industries could be unlikely to increase their guidance in the near term given policy uncertainties related to Medicare Part D programs.

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Tariffs on Asian countries are shaking up Silicon Valley, driving up prices and deepening global tensions Big Tech is a big loser in a global trade war, said Julia Shapero in The Hill. Last week's stock market rout was especially hard on companies like Apple, Dell, and HP that "depend extensively on manufacturing and supply chains that run through China and Taiwan." Apple certainly knew it wasn't going to dodge any trade war unscathed, "given that most of its products are produced in China." But even efforts to diversify away from China in recent years didn't save it after steep tariffs were also placed Vietnam (46 percent) and India (26 percent). It will be difficult for Apple and other companies not to pass the costs on to consumers. Wall Street analysts, for instance, have calculated that all the tariffs planned for computer equipment will raise the $799 price of the cheapest iPhone 16 model to over $1,140. Tech companies that hardly import anything are also getting battered, said Mike Isaac in The New York Times. Tech giants like Meta and Google that rely on digital advertising collect billions from "small and medium-size businesses" from around the world that are likely to "spend less on advertising" in the United States. Meta is particularly vulnerable. Roughly "10 percent of its revenue in 2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily on advertising." Temu and Shein, Chinese e-commerce platforms, are expected to practically disappear after Trump closed the trade loophole that allowed them to sell cheap products in the U.S. Tariffs will even "boost costs for businesses building the infrastructure to deliver artificial intelligence," said Isabelle Bousquette in The Wall Street Journal. Trump exempted semiconductors from tariffs for now. But everything from the price of steel used to build data centers to the wiring inside of them is under the threat of taxation. Tech lobbyists are still hoping that tariffs bring Europe to the negotiating table, said Brendan Bordelon and Gabby Miller in Politico. Silicon Valley has for years "been complaining about foreign regulations on their platforms—taxes, fines, and restrictions that the U.S. doesn't impose." One of their biggest hopes was that Trump's tariffs would finally make European countries back down. They still might. But for now, the EU is suggesting it may "double down," hitting U.S. tech companies even harder in a counterstrike that can easily snowball into a tech cold war. Escape your echo chamber.

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Make Everything More Expensive

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resources. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Make Everything More Expensive

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resources. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

(NYSE: MRK). Shareholders who purchased shares of MRK during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/merck-co-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=142490&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Editor Activism C.Z. Means, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout, Whitney Webb In Part I of this series on the overlap between the worlds of Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jeffrey Epstein, we examine Combs’ early years, his mentors and the industry figures who ensured their, as well as Combs’ own, commercial success. Ties to organized crime and intelligence are readily apparent and point toward a truly sinister reason behind this network’s patronage of Combs and his close associates, like Andre Harrell and Russell Simmons. Beginning in late 2023, a series of startling and unsettling allegations against Sean Combs –– a record executive and rapper known over the years by stage names like “Puff Daddy,” “P. Diddy” and presently “Diddy” –– have emerged. As the allegations and lawsuits facing Combs have snowballed, so, too, has public interest in the case. The sheer amount of accusations suggests that Combs, in addition to being very sexually and physically violent, filmed many assault encounters and orgies that occurred at his now notorious “Freak Off” parties, sometimes with hidden or security cameras. He also now stands accused of “operating an empire of sexual crimes,” with federal agents having alleged that several of Combs’ victims were of “barely legal” or “barely illegal” age at the time of their abuse. Combs’ apparent documentation of these events strongly suggests that he was interested in keeping these records for more than his perverse enjoyment, as either a form of a protection or as a means to control those who appeared in these films, i.e. blackmail. As a result, speculation has grown about who is allegedly on the “list” of people filmed by Combs in this way, prompting comparisons to the alleged “list” of sex trafficker, pedophile and intelligence asset Jeffrey Epstein. The comparisons between Epstein and Combs have only grown, with even the homeland security agents who raided Combs’ Miami home suggesting that Combs was “as bad as Epstein.” However, as has long been a theme of Unlimited Hangout’s Epstein-related reporting, including the book One Nation Under Blackmail, the Jeffrey Epstein case has been poorly explored by the federal government, mainstream media outlets, and even many independent media outlets. A deeper examination of the Epstein case makes it clear that Epstein was not the sole mastermind or sole beneficiary of the sex trafficking and blackmail operation in which he engaged. Instead, Epstein served as an operator for a larger, monied network of oligarchs with extensive organized crime connections in addition to significant affiliations with intelligence agencies. He was also more than a sex trafficker for this group, having aided this network extensively in arms trafficking, money laundering and other crimes (many financial) that fall outside of the focus on his sex-related offenses. It should come as no surprise upon closer examination of Sean Combs that, like Epstein, he was operating on behalf of a larger network that he did not ultimately control. Instead, it arguably controlled him. As this three-part series from Unlimited Hangout will endeavor to show, Combs was acting on behalf of an oligarch network that directly overlaps with that of Epstein. However, Combs used to influence a different industry and a different community for the benefit of these intelligence and organized crime-connected oligarchs. In Part I of this series, we will examine the often overlooked early years of Combs and his entrance into the music industry. While Combs’ own rise (from birth to the founding of Bad Boy Records in 1993) is certainly chronicled, a major focus of this piece is on the mentors and figures who facilitated his rise into the upper echelons of hip hop celebrity, especially Andre Harrell and Clive Davis, as well as other figures who had a significant influence on Combs’ early career into the music industry, like Russell Simmons. Not only did these figures bring Combs into the music industry, they also stand accused of initiating Combs into the types of activities he is now in prison for, awaiting trial. Also explored in this piece are the corporations behind the success of Combs’ mentors and later Combs himself, namely the Music Corporation of America (MCA) and Arista Records. When taken together with other claims from the period, namely about efforts to manipulate hip hop for the benefit of the private prison industry in the early to mid-1990s, it appears that this network’s interest in Combs, as well as his mentors, was part of something much larger that sought to target not just the hip hop industry itself, but the African-American community at large. Subsequent installments of this series will examine Combs’ activities –– in music, in retail and beyond –– and how the same network detailed in Part I also enabled those activities, which notably parallel Combs’ deeper descent into acts of sexual violence and abuse. Another installment will examine how one close associate of Combs also connects very directly with the sex trafficking activities of Jeffrey Epstein, indicating that the overlap between the two cases is more significant than previous reporting and the current cases against Combs have suggested. Sean Combs was born in Harlem, NY on November 4, 1969 to a schoolteacher and ex-model named Janice Combs (née Smalls) and Melvin Earl Combs, an Air Force serviceman and sometimes associate of American Gangster heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. Melvin Combs helped make ends meet by running a number of legal and less-than-legal operations; including a cab and limousine chauffeuring company, multiple bars Combs owned, and a portion of Harlem drug traffic.i A toddler-aged Combs tagged along with Melvin on visits to Lucas’ home, even playing with his daughter. According to an interview prior to his death, the aged gangster alleged that Combs didn’t share his toys. “I learned early in life that there’s only two ways out of that [lifestyle]: dead or in jail,” explained Combs in 2013, speaking of his father’s lifestyle. “It made me work even harder… I have his hustler’s mentality.” According to contemporaries, Melvin was an immaculate dresser. While less flashy than Lucas, who once attracted the attention of the feds by sitting ringside at a Muhammad Ali –Joe Frazier bout in a $100,000 fur coat, Melvin still pulled out enough stops to be granted the street nickname “Pretty Melvin.” When Sean Combs was 3 years old, Melvin Combs was gunned down while sitting in a loitering car near Central Park West. Per Susan Traugh, Melvin was shot in the head, likely at point blank range considering he was seated in his Mercedes-Benz—this manner of a hit is consistent with an enforcer killing.ii According to an interview conducted by author Zack O’Malley-Greenburg, someone in Melvin Combs’ circle believed he was about to inform on a sensitive business deal to law enforcement and that this is what precipitated his murder.iii From this, former associates and law enforcement have speculated that Melvin Combs was a federal informant. If allegations from incarcerated contemporaneous label heads like Suge Knight and former bodyguards are to believed, Sean Combs may have done the same, allegedly informing for the FBI over the course of his career. A recent article from journalist Legs McNeil lays out the Lucas-Combs criminal enterprise in greater detail than previously reported. It also shows that Melvin Combs, in addition to his dealings with Lucas, had an arguably deeper affiliation with the Gambino crime family near the end of his life. The Gambinos may have even put out his hit. McNeil writes: Melvin Combs, a small-time hustler, was introduced to selling heroin when Lucas fronted him several kilos from his Golden Triangle connection. He joined the crew of Willie Abraham, the 42-year-old owner of the Harlem Gold Lounge and a convicted heroin dealer who’d already spent five years in jail. Unlike Lucas, Abraham was getting his heroin from the Mafia—specifically, the Gambino crime family. In 1971, Melvin was arrested for possession of heroin and $45,000 in cash. When Abraham’s heroin‐cutting mill was raided later that year, and Abraham was charged with participating in an extensive conspiracy to distribute $5 million a year in heroin at the wholesale level in Harlem, the Bronx, and Westchester County, Melvin was suspected by Alphonse “Funzi” Sisca, head of the Gambinos’ New Jersey crew, of being a rat. McNeil also noted that “The New York Times reported that the prosecutor in the Abraham case told the judge that law enforcement believed Melvin’s murder ‘might ultimately be traced to members of the heroin‐distributing conspiracy.’” A newspaper clipping from the Saturday, February 24th, 1973 edition of the New York Daily News reveals that the Gambino-backed Willie Abraham crew had plenty or reason to suspect Combs of informing or at least blamed him for the arrests. The article notes that their relationship to Combs appears to have led directly to Abraham and his collaborators’ convictionson conspiracy charges, including Gambino man Alphonso Sisca of New Jersey: Willie Abraham […] was found guilty in Manhattan Federal Court yesterday of being a kingpin narcotics wholesaler whose ring flooded the metropolitan area with more than 1,000 pounds of drugs in 2 1/2 years. A task force of federal, state and local cops smashed the ring in a series of raids in December 1971 as the result of information obtained through the court approved wiretaps on another big time narcotics dealer’s phone. The dealer, Melvin Combs, 31, of 1853 Central Ave., Yonkers, was found shot to death in January 1972 on Manhattan’s West Side. This evidence of a reported “wiretap” supports the claim that Abraham and his Gambino Family backers had Combs murdered because they blamed him for the arrests, regardless of whether Combs had actually been an informant. Throughout this article, connections to the Gambino crime family, as well as the Genovese crime family, are a recurring theme. In the earliest years of his life, Sean Combs lived in Esplanade Gardens. His mother Janice recognized the performative, attention-hungry character her son possessed early on. This led to Combs’ first advertising gig at the age of 2, when he starred in a Baskin-Robbins TV commercial. Later, Combs modeled alongside The Wiz actress Stephanie Mills in Essence magazine. Following in his mother’s footsteps, these early modeling jobs presaged Combs’ lifelong relationship with the modeling industry, which in comparable fashion to Jeffrey Epstein, would eventually become the hunting grounds which Combs would scour for victims for his orgiastic sexual blackmail parties and pathological predation.iv During his middle school years, Combs’ mother Janice relocated the family to Westchester, a middle-class suburb of Mount Vernon. Combs enrolled in the prestigious Mount Saint Michael Academy (MSMA), a Catholic school located in the Bronx, where his popularity eventually soared due to his exploits on the varsity football team, which won a division title during his time there. Combs’ hopes of receiving a scholarship to play D1 in college came crashing down when he broke his leg during his senior year. Yet, it was already too late for his confidence. He was reportedly given the nickname “Puffy” due to the way he strutted around with his chest puffed out.v Throughout his middle and high school years, Combs also exhibited an entrepreneurial streak, reportedly selling T-shirts and ties at Macy’s while working multiple newspaper routes simultaneously. This early relationship with Macy’s prefigures both his later merchandising deals with the department store, which saw his fragrance line Sean John stock the shelves nationwide, and the recent lawsuit filed by a John Doe from Ohio who alleges that Combs “orally raped” him in the stockroom of the flagship Macy’s in New York in 2008. His accuser alleges that Macy’s even endeavored to cover up the crime in order to preserve their lucrative business relationship. While speculative, there is a possibility that this may have even been the same Macy’s that had employed Combs as a minor. Notably, while Combs attended the all-boys Mount Saint Michael’s Academy, a major sex abuse case involving minor victims that led to the indictments of two faculty members was brewing at the institution. Marist Brother Timothy Brady –– the principal of MSMA for the entirety of Combs’ high school career — was arrested, charged, and sentenced to prison in 1988 for the abuse of three minor boys at the Catholic Academy in the Bronx over the course of 1987, Combs’ senior year. Following the ‘86/’87 academic year, Br. Brady was quietly removed from his position and shipped off to a Marist retreat in Arizona. Despite his crimes, Brady was reinstated as a hockey moderator at a separate Marist Brothers institution in the 1990s, once again providing him access to minors, and was listed on the Marist Brothers website until 2010. For some inexplicable reason, the court records pertaining to Brady’s conviction and incarceration remain sealed. Accusations of sexual impropriety appear to have been a constant in MSMA’s history. In 2011, a former assistant principal received a sweetheart no-jail sentence after pleading guilty to possession of child porn on an electronic device at the school. From 2009 to 2012, a lawsuit filed by Brian Elliott sought monetary damages for the routine abuse and rape he alleges he suffered at the hands of an MSMA employee named Br. Galligan between the ages of 8 and 13 over the years of 1977 through 1983. The case wound its way through various Delaware, New York, and appellate courts. If factual, Elliott’s victimization by Galligan would have ended around the time of Combs’ freshman year in high school, meaning Elliott and Combs were close in age. More recently, multiple cases seeking redress of child sexual abuse suffered at the hands of the MSMA faculty have been filed pursuant to New York’s Child Victims Act and the “look-back window” that has enabled past victims previously barred from filing complaints by the statute of limitations to now pursue them. These include a torts CVA complaint filed on behalf of a John Doe suing the Academy & the Marist Brothers of the Schools for having enabled his abuse at the hands of Principal Brady, who allegedly fondled the plaintiff in the nurse’s office in 1985 when Doe was 16. It appears this unnamed potential victim would have been in the same class as Combs. Quoting from the complaint, “Upon information and belief, at all relevant times, Defendants knew that priests and brothers of the Catholic Church and within the Marist Brothers, under their supervision and control, were grooming and sexually molesting children with whom the priests and brothers would have contact in their ministry and pastoral functions.” Another lawsuit accusing the Marist Brothers of protecting a pedophile faculty member named Brother Lee advanced in the Supreme Court of Bronx County in 2023, surviving multiple motions for dismissal & summary judgment, seemingly indicating that multiple members of the school’s faculty –– including its principal –– were perpetrating sex crimes against minors during Combs’ high school career. And once again, the complainant alleges that he was abused by Brother Lee between the years of 1984 and 1985, when he was 15-16 years of age, conclusively indicating that he also would have been in Combs’ class of 1987. Taking all of this information into account, it appears that sexual abuse was endemic and widespread at MSMA during Combs’ time there. While impossible to confirm, there is a possibility that Combs was groomed or among the victims or else somehow connected to these aforementioned cases. Certainly, those type of experiences early in life are statistically associated with a person offending in similar ways later in life. Also, as an aside, the FBI and DA’s office appear to have used the fraught climate at MSMA to initiate a COINTELPRO-inspired smear and lawfare campaign against Fr. Bernard Lynch, the first gay married priest and Fordham-trained Irish psychotherapist, who inspired a “witch-hunt” organized by the Vatican, archdiocese, and the FBI in retaliation to his outspoken advocacy for gay rights. More specifically, Lynch had founded Dignity NY, the first gay ministry in New York City in 1982, bringing him to the attention of Mayor Ed Koch, who drafted him onto his AIDS Task Force.vi While attending Mount St. Michael’s, a teenage Combs began frequenting several New York nightclubs, which reportedly led to his first encounter with the music industry and famous musicians like Michael Jackson. As detailed in an interview, given in 1994 shortly after launching Bad Boy Records, Combs seemingly claimed he was cast as a background dancer in one of Jackson’s videos as a teen: “Around the age of 16 or 17, I started dancing, going to the various clubs, and that was during the time when somebody—(if) a big artist like Diana Ross, Fine Young Cannibals, or even Michael Jackson had a video—the directors would come into the clubs and see all the kids that were dancing and pick various dancers to be in the videos. So I got picked to be in some of those videos, and, um, as I was dancing in videos and stuff like that, I would see the behind the scenes. I was about to go to college at Howard University and I didn’t know what I wanted to do. So I saw the people behind the scenes, and I was like, ‘that’s maybe something I wanted to do’, so I started like asking questions and getting information on the music industry…” Combs’ apparent encounter with Michael Jackson, while still only a teenage dancer on the NY club circuit, presages the significant relationship that later emerged between the music mogul and the King of Pop, which lasted for decades until Jackson’s premature and suspicious death. These interlocks between Combs and Jackson are worth mentioning for a few reasons: both artists have grappled with accusations of sexual abuse; both men have spent years surrounded by Zionist powerbrokers (within and outside of the music industry) who ingratiated themselves into their good graces or insinuated their way into their circles; and both Combs and Jackson cultivated close friendships with billionaire Epstein affiliate and Bill Clinton associate, Ron Burkle. For instance, Burkle, who will be a focus of Part II of this series for his ties to Combs, was close to Jackson and later purchased Jackson’s infamous Neverland Ranch estate for $22 million in 2020. Burkle is also reportedly the godfather to Combs’ children. While developing his ties to both Jackson and Combs, Burkle was a frequent flier on Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous private jet –– the “Lolita Express” –– particularly on flights including former President Bill Clinton, who he employed as an advisor to his firm, the Yucaipa Companies around the same period. Following his graduation from Mount St. Michael Academy, Combs enrolled at the prestigious Howard University in Washington, DC to study business in 1987. He promptly set about further inflating his street cred as he expanded his horizons into a new popularity-maximizing enterprise –– party planning and promotion. His parties were described by classmates as offering a “once-in-a-lifetime type of vibe” and Combs spared no expense in spreading the word, driving around campus in his convertible to pass out fliers for events. Author Susan Traugh wrote that some of Combs’ collegiate parties attracted thousands of guests. Comb’s entrance onto the hip hop scene began during his freshman year when Combs scored a side-gig as rapper-beatboxer Doug E. Fresh’s valet, where he “shuttl[ed] Fresh’s clothes to and from the dry cleaner in his Volkswagen Rabbit convertible.”vii All the while, Combs organized parties in and around the Beltway as well as back home in New York City on the weekends. He was also a background dancer in one of Fresh’s music videos around this time. While at Howard, the darker, predatory side of Combs’ reputation also began to take shape, with accusations of belligerence, sexual harassment, and domestic violence following in his wake. Contemporaneous accounts provided by sources to Rolling Stone tell of Combs beating a girlfriend with his belt in full view of the public on the Howard quad. Another time, he tapped on the glass window of an English class in session to try and coax a woman into skipping. On another occasion, he non-consensually caressed a woman’s back and asked her if he could introduce her to “one of his friends.” By age 20, Combs had begun focusing more of his attention on his nascent internship and career at Uptown Records, a job he had first secured in 1990 via his Mount Vernon neighbor, the rapper Heavy D. Combs’ initiative soon saw him become former Def Jam recordman Andre Harrell’s intern. He commuted from Howard to NYC via Amtrak in the mornings, stowing away in the bathroom to avoid paying fare. He also shadowed party promoter Jessica Rosenblum during the planning stages for Heavy D’s platinum-album celebration. Rosenblum “obliged his requests to take him to all the ‘freaky’ nightspots on the Lower East Side.”viii Rosenblum takes credit for having introduced Combs to some of the biggest names among NY scenesters and club kids — as well as updating his eyewear fashion. Rosenblum graduated from her hip hop party promoter career to become a NYC interior designer wedded to Steve Young, head of global litigation for one of the Big 4 Accounting firms, Ernst & Young. In the late 1980s, while still a student at Howard, Combs learned that Uptown Records’ A&R (artists and repertoire) executive had vacated the company. Combs took his boss Andre Harrell out to lunch to press for the job and, after a successful schmooze, soon transformed himself into one of the youngest talent scouts in the industry.ix Combs later told Rolling Stone that, after joining Uptown, “Andre became like my big brother. He bought a mansion, gave me a room [. . .] Not a mansion, a big house. It was a mansion to me, though, and he had gave [sic] me a room in the house.” Prior to his mentorship of Sean Combs, Uptown’s Andre Harrell first broke into the nascent hip hop industry by way of his rap duo Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, which he and a friend had formed in high school. Harrell withdrew from Lehman College in 1983 to focus on his career as an account executive selling airtime for New York all-news AM station WINS. WINS was previously owned by radio pioneer J. Elroy McCaw, an ex-OSS agent and member of the Advisory Council to the US National Security Council.x McCaw hired trailblazing disc jockey Allan Freed to man the mic at the station, a deal that was brokered by record executive Morris Levy.xi Per Potash, a US Assistant Attorney later claimed that Levy’s jazz label Roulette Records, boosted by his relationship with WINS’ Freed –– the most popular DJ in the country in the 1950s and 1960s –– was a “way station for heroin trafficking.” Levy and Roulette were also linked to organized crime, specifically the Genovese crime family. Levy was notably the main financier behind the first hip hop record label, Sugar Hill. The zenith of Freed’s celebrity was exemplified by Paramount Pictures hiring him at a rate of $29,000 per day to make a teen movie in 1957. Shortly thereafter, Freed was targeted by a smear campaign, resulting in him being unceremoniously and inexplicably fired by McCaw in 1958. Freed was singled out by Orrin Hatch’s Congressional committee during the first “payola” scandal involving the bribing of radio stations in return for singles plays. As a result, Freed became the face of the scandal, his career in shambles. As Potash writes regarding Freed’s downfall, “Morris Levy, the source of much of the payola bribe money, was never called to testify.”xii Months after joining WINS, Harrell’s job prospects experienced a dramatic upswing when he met Russell Simmons, co-founder of the Def Jam record label, who would later become very close to Sean Combs. Simmons soon offered Harrell a job with Def Jam. Within two short years (a rapid ascent mirroring Combs’ own), Harrell worked his way up to VP and general manager of the label. Def Jam’s early success was due in part to its 1984 distribution deal with CBS and its subsidiary Columbia Records. At the time, the label was run by Walter Yetnikoff, a close associate and friend of Clive Davis –– the man who would later become Sean Combs’ second mentor after Harrell that is a later focus of this piece. Appointed by Paley, Yetnikoff is heavily implicated in the Payola scandals of the 1980s that involved the “independent promotion” syndicate known as The Network, for which CBS Records was one of the biggest clients.xiii Yetnikoff went to some ends to protect the established payola system, firing his deputy president Dick Asher in 1983 and, per UPI, even quashing an investigation by the Recording Industry Association of America. By 1986, CBS Records had come under the control of Laurence Tisch, the billionaire head of Loews Corporation and a founding member of the Leslie Wexner and Charles Bronfman-brokered “Mega Group.” Harrell’s success in management, contrary to music-making, seemed to have clarified things for Harrell, as his short-lived stint as a Profile Records artist came to a close when his high school rap duo with Alonzo Brown split up in 1986. That same year, Harrell struck out on his own to create Uptown. However, before leaving Def Jam, Harrell was responsible for Def Jam’s hiring of Israeli-American Lyor “Little Lansky” Cohen, who would later force out Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin in order to co-run the label with Simmons. Years later, upon leaving Def Jam, Cohen would team up with the family who had taken control of Def Jam in the 1990s, the Bronfmans, to become the top executive at Warner Music, an event that will be revisited in Part II of this series. Not unlike Def Jam, Uptown’s early success (and the furtherance of Harrell’s career in the industry) was due to its distribution deal with a major entertainment conglomerate. In Uptown’s case, the company in question was the Music Corporation of American (MCA), an entertainment giant that dominated the American music and movie industry for many decades. Uptown’s early distribution deal with MCA began in 1987 and soon expanded into a formal partnership with the company a year later in 1988. Their ties grew even deeper in 1992, when MCA offered Uptown a $50 million deal whereby Uptown expanded into film and television. In a Vanity Fair obituary for Andre Harrell, screenwriter and journalist Barry Michael Cooper describes an anecdote involving Harrell and a bust-up at the MCA Records Conference in Midtown Manhattan that demonstrates how Harrell employed street enforcers and drug dealers at Uptown, and that they even procured him a gun for protection: There was a rumor going around the streets of New York that Teddy’s manager, former drug dealer and karate enthusiast Gene Griffin, had smacked Andre in the conference of MCA Records in Midtown Manhattan. Journalist and author Nelson George, gave me Andre’s telephone number, so I could confirm the story. I called Andre and identified myself, and asked him about the confrontation with Griffin. I also asked him about the story of two of his Uptown Record executives—Jimmy “Luv” Jenkins and George Harrell (no relation), two of the most respected street dudes from the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, and 116th Street in Harlem, respectively—giving him a .45 automatic to keep for protection. Andre tried to place the gun in the back of his waistband. However, the .45 slipped through and down his pants, and landed on the floor of the elevator. Andre, Jimmy, and George jumped back, but the gun didn’t discharge. Andre didn’t respond for almost a minute, and then said to me, “Who are you supposed to be? Ed Bradley? Things happen.” We cracked up laughing, and became fast friends after that. In addition to MCA being critical to Harrell’s career and MCA’s success, Uptown’s relationship with MCA also appears to align with one of Combs’ earliest known sex crimes. For instance, one of the earliest allegations against Combs asserts that Combs sexually assaulted a victim after an MCA event in New York in 1990 or 1991, a time when Combs was still an Uptown employee. As Strictly Business scriptwriter Nelson George intimated in a Substack post eulogizing his friend Andre Harrell, Harrell was a known “party animal” who frequently threw house parties in the “work space/social club/temporary housing” that served as the nascent Uptown Records’ offices. In fact, one of these parties in 1990 served as the source of inspiration for Strictly Business, the film that George co-wrote with Pam Gibson and which Andre Harrell executive produced for Island World Pictures (a company then affiliated with Polygram, which took a significant stake in Def Jam in 1992). It was Harrell’s role in the film that reportedly led MCA to enter into its $50 million multimedia deal with Uptown in 1992 that saw Harrell’s company expand into film. Strictly Business concerns a young mail room clerk setting up a black middle manager at a real estate firm with a club chick played by the emerging starlet Halle Berry. Bobby the mail clerk is a party boy with aspirations of graduating from the trainee broker program, and so he agrees to help Waymon navigate seducing the attractive woman in return for his higher-up’s sponsorship of his candidacy. While the plot may seem like normal rom-com fare and relatively benign, when viewed within the context of the kinds of sexual quid pro quos that occur within the music industry and Harrell’s close ties to figures like Combs, Simmons, and their broader social networks, it starts to take on a distinctly different slant. Speaking of sexual quid pro quos in the music industry and questionable label romances, Andre Harrell left an indelible influence on Combs’ love life. He hired Uptown R&B singer Al B. Sure’s model girlfriend Kim Porter to work as a receptionist at the label. Combs’ was immediately smitten with her, loving what he couldn’t have. They would go on to have an on-and-off again relationship spanning the years from 1994 to 2018, the time of her mysterious death after contracting a virulent case of lobar pneumonia. We will return to Porter and Combs’ ties to the modeling industry in Part III of this series. Andre Harrell was also a consultant for the film New Jack City. New Jack City’s screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper recalls how he and producer George Jackson called his close friend Andre Harrell into Robert De Niro’s Tribeca Productions compound to watch the dailies from New Jack City a week before production wrapped. Cooper and Jackson wanted to gauge Andre Harrell’s reaction to New Jack City’s narrative and the depictions of street life as it related to the crack epidemic. Per Cooper’s retelling, apparently Harrell raved and affectionately called the film “The Black Godfather.” New Jack City’s narrative revolves around a Harlem gang called the Cash Money Brothers who ascend to the top of the drug-dealing food chain in the borough once crack cocaine is introduced to the streets. The film featured gangster rap mainstay Ice-T in a prominent role and christened the careers of Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, seeing a healthy return of nearly $50 million on a budget of $8 million. The controversial film was developed by Warner Brothers, which was then run by Steve Ross. Ross was able to build up his business empire, Kinney National Company (which later became Warner), largely through his association with New York crime lords Manny Kimmel and Abner “Longy” Zwillman. Zwillman was a close associate of Meyer Lansky and Sam Bronfman. Ross, as a Warner executive, later frequented Robert Maxwell’s yacht in the late 1980s, a time when Maxwell was deeply associated with a litany of organized crime figures across the globe. In addition, top Warner executives close to Ross personally were convicted for their roles in a mob-tied racketeering scheme that was also allegedly involved Ross, though he somehow evaded charges. Considering his informal consultation on the film and the fact that Harrell had underwritten “new jack swing” — Uptown’s claim to fame and the genre from which the film took its name, which fused streetwise hip hop beats and melodic R&B for the first time — Harrell’s influence over the New Jack City production is clear. This is an important point, as it relates to mob-linked entertainment companies (in this case Warner Brothers) financing the glorification of drug dealing around 1991, a topic that we will return to in much greater detail near the end of this piece. While MCA undoubtedly dominated much of American entertainment for decades, it was also deeply connected to organized crime and political power. In terms of MCA’s political power, this arguably peaked under the Reagan administration, which boasted extremely close ties to the company. MCA even played a role in covert operations that brought together organized crime interests and intelligence agencies during this period. The most iconic executive in MCA’s history, Lew Wasserman, joined the company in 1936. By that point, Wasserman had established longstanding, close ties to Jewish mobster and Meyer Lansky-associate Moe Dalitz, having allegedly initiated those ties by having first served as the publicist for the Dalitz-controlled Mayfair Casino. However, some sources contend that Wasserman had joined Dalitz’s Mayfield Road Gang before working at the Mayfair. Wasserman later married the daughter of Dalitz’s long-time lawyer Henry Beckerman, who he had first met through his work at the casino. Wasserman and MCA were also the forces chiefly responsible for the political career of former president Ronald Reagan. Reagan, previously an actor before becoming a politician, had been represented by MCA since 1940. Soon after, he became Wasserman’s first “million dollar client.” Wasserman later engineered Reagan’s campaign to lead the Screen Actors Guild, where Reagan made significant policy changes designed to give MCA an edge over other entertainment companies. Wasserman and other top MCA executives, such as Taft Schreiber and Jules Stein, played an intimate role in Reagan’s successful gubernatorial bid, as well as financing his later campaign for president of the United States. When Reagan was president, his Attorney General Edwin Meese notably quashed what had been an ongoing investigation into MCA’s organized crime ties. Meese later resigned following his involvement in the Bronx-based Wedtech scandal (see end note vi). That probe was initiated when evidence was found that MCA was engaged in business relations with the Gambino crime family. More specifically, MCA had hired a high-ranking Gambino associate, Salvatore Pisello, as an official representative of the company, even though Pisello had no experience in the music or movie business. At the time Pisello was doing business with MCA, he was also simultaneously a partner of Morris Levy, the Genovese family-linked record executive behind Roulette Records who financed the early hip hop label Sugar Hill. Levy’s connection to Andre Harrell’s early employer WINS was noted earlier in this article. MCA kept Pisello around even though they lost money on every deal where Pisello had represented them and continued to work with him after his mob ties became publicly known. This was done at the behest of Wasserman, then chairman of the board of MCA, and Sidney Sheinberg, then president of MCA Inc., despite protests from other board members. One of the main MCA executives that had been closely involved with the company’s Pisello dealings, Irving Azoff, was subsequently promoted to become head of MCA’s Music Entertainment Division, the division that –– shortly thereafter –– entered into a distribution agreement with Andre Harrell’s Uptown Records. Azoff has long publicly praised Harrell and later eulogized him at his 2020 funeral. Irving Azoff was also Combs’ neighbor in the exclusive Beverly Hills enclave known as “Billionaires’ Row” up until Combs put the $60 million estate on the market in September 2024, not long after DHS raided the property. The shuttered federal investigation into MCA also turned up evidence that the company was tied to the Genovese crime family. As noted earlier, the Genovese crime family had also been linked to Morris Levy (Levy was also involved with some of Pisello’s dealings with MCA). In addition, during this same period, the mob-style murder of retail billionaire Leslie Wexner’s then-tax attorney, Arthur Shapiro, led Columbus police investigators to link both Shapiro’s death and Wexner himself to Genovese criminal interests. Shortly after Shapiro’s death, Jeffrey Epstein entered into Wexner’s inner circle, “tasked with getting [Wexner’s] finances in order.” MCA also has connections to a significant, yet largely forgotten scandal of the 1980s involving many of the same players from the Iran-Contra network, as well as figures like Robert Maxwell. The scandal, known as the PROMIS software scandal, saw operatives tied to US and Israeli intelligence team up with organized crime elements to both steal and then repurpose PROMIS –– a then-revolutionary software product for data management –– as a back-door surveillance system that was marketed to other intelligence agencies, sensitive government research laboratories, and a litany of banks around the globe. One of MCA’s top executives, Eugene Gianquinto, who then led MCA’s Home Entertainment Division, was intimately involved in major aspects of the scandal and its illegal activities. Gianquinto later took credit for the closure of the Department of Justice’s investigation into MCA’s mob ties. More specifically, MCA and Gianquinto were connected to the elements of the PROMIS scandal based within the mob-linked joint venture between the Cabazon Indian Reservation and the Wackenhut Corporation to develop weapon systems –– some of which were intended for the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras. Journalist Danny Casolaro, who died in connection with his efforts to expose the network ultimately behind the PROMIS scandal, had stated before his death that he was writing about a network he called “the Octopus,” which –– oddly enough –– was a longstanding nickname for MCA. Between 1994 and 1995, MCA was acquired by the Bronfman family company, Seagrams. A few years later, the Bronfmans also took control of Def Jam. The Bronfmans, like MCA itself, have an extensive history of organized crime connections, which date back to the mob-brokered bootlegging of American Prohibition in the 1920s. Wasserman, a long-time associate of Edgar Bronfman Sr., got a Seagrams board seat out of the deal and became chairman emeritus of the company. Edgar Bronfman Jr. quickly brought on Hollywood powerbroker Michael Ovitz, who later became president of Disney and a Jeffrey Epstein associate. Bronfman Jr. is also listed in Epstein’s black book and his father’s alleged ties to Epstein’s Bear Stearns career likely played a role in Epstein’s ouster from the bank in 1981. Ovitz, at the time he teamed up with Bronfman Jr., was close to Herbert Allen of Allen & Co, a company with ties to organized crime as well as the aforementioned PROMIS scandal. The Bronfmans, particularly Edgar Bronfman Jr., will feature prominently in Part II of this series, with Bronfman negotiating major deals with Combs in the early 2000s. In 1991, Edgar Jr.’s uncle, Charles Bronfman, teamed up with Leslie Wexner (then already very intimately tied to Epstein) in 1991 to create the “Study Group” or “Mega Group,” an ostensibly philanthropic organization that was chiefly focused on ethno-philanthropy and philanthropy directed at promoting Zionism and financing aspects of the state of Israel. Yet, this particular group brought together some of the most prominent corporate billionaires in the United States, the majority of whom share ties to organized crime. Wexner, as previously mentioned was tied to Genovese crime interests by Columbus police, while the Bronfmans’ own history with organized crime, specifically the Lansky-co-founded National Crime Syndicate, have been extensively documented. Other early members include other organized crime-linked families like the Crowns of Chicago (via Lester Crown) and Laurence Tisch, owner of CBS including its many influential record labels. The Tisch family, mentioned throughout this article, has ties to organized crime as well. For instance, Laurence Tisch engaged in a suspicious sale of his shares in the struggling Franklin National Bank to Michele Sindona, the Italian mafia-linked businessman who played a major role in Operation Gladio, which brought together the CIA, Italian Mafia and the Vatican. Sindona was also a member of the infamous Italian freemasonic lodge P2. In addition, the Tisch family company, Loews, did extensive business with Resorts International. For instance, Loews was the long-time operator of Resorts International-owned hotel Paradise Island Hotel and Villas in the Bahamas. Senate testimony later linked Paradise Island specifically to Meyer Lansky. Resorts International itself deserves an important mention as well, given that it started as Mary Carter Paint Company, a CIA front company founded by the Dulles brothers with extensive ties to Meyer Lansky and his associates, that focused on developing businesses in the Bahamas. After the death of the company’s long-time, mob-linked head James Crosby in 1986, Donald Trump took over the company, only to lose control of it two years later. Another member of this exclusive club, the “Mega Group,” was director Steven Spielberg. A protégé of Lew Wasserman and Sidney Sheinberg, Spielberg would later play an unusual role in king-making the future film career of director Brett Ratner, an associate of Russell Simmons, Andre Harrell, and Sean Combs who boasts of his childhood ties to Meyer Lansky and to the alleged heir to Lansky’s criminal enterprises, Al Malnik. Ratner’s significance is a focus of a later section of this piece. After becoming the A&R man at Harrell’s Uptown, Combs dropped out of Howard to pursue his dream. He then truly made a name for himself with his handling of the nascent careers of newcomers Mary J. Blige and Jodeci. His reworking of their sounds and re-styling of their images led to both debut records going multi-platinum. Combs’ success at Uptown, however, was marred by his role in planning events and parties that turned violent. In addition, more recent accusations of sexual violence, the filming of rapes and other crimes are alleged to have taken place during Combs’ later years at Uptown, making violence a noticeable and early theme in Combs’ early music industry career. In December 1991, the tragedy of the Community College of New York celebrity basketball game stampede, which Combs had helped plan, forced him and his mother to lay low, leading to them hiding out in a Manhattan hotel to avoid scrutiny amid rumors of possible criminal charges for Combs. The stampede ultimately left 9 dead. Combs had promoted this game as a charity event intended to raise funds for AIDS relief over the radio and through informal channels. The massive crowd, which had gathered to watch Heavy D (one of Uptown’s main artists) and LL Cool J (one of Def Jam’s first big acts) shoot hoops, ended up breaking into a fatal stampede. A report commissioned by the New York Mayor’s office condemned “almost all of the individuals involved in the event[, who] demonstrated a lack of responsibility” as well as NYPD officers in the scene, who were accused of “serious lapses in judgment.” The report blamed Combs in particular “for allowing two inexperienced subordinates to handle a potentially perilous event and for deceiving ticket buyers about [the event’s] charitable intent.” “City College is something I deal with every day of my life,” Combs later said in 1998. “But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.” During this period, when Combs was still at Uptown, his penchant for throwing wild, and allegedly violent, parties continued. However, it soon merged with new scenes, particularly those of the music industry and the New York club scene. In his memoir Notorious C.O.P., the former head of the NYPD Rap Intelligence Unit Derrick Parker (a COINTELPRO legacy program that grew directly out of interagency cooperation & the BOSS unitxiv) writes of his first introduction to Combs: “Even before the CCNY disaster, well before he was a tabloid fixture, I became aware of Puffy [i.e. Sean Combs]. He was hard to miss as he gallivanted around early ’90s hip-hop clubs and up the ladder of the music industry, right from the bottom rung. At the time, Puffy was little known outside music biz circles: he wasn’t even a performer yet, but a rising A&R executive at Uptown Records who threw crazy, notoriously raucous parties at a midtown club called Red Zone. I knew about Puffy even then because I’d always kept one foot in the music world. I’d been promoting parties and hitting the clubs, as well as performing and recording demos as an R&B singer.”xv Red Zone was a short-lived Midtown club ensconced in a former ABC filming studio at 440 West 54th Street. “Club Kids” like Michael Alig, RuPaul, and others in the late 1980s and early 1990s were known to frequent the establishment. The establishment was first opened by Maurice Brahms, the uncrowned king of the NYC Club Scene, the former restaurateur and owner-operator of infamous, gay-catering nightlife discotheques such as Bonds, Infinity, & Underground. Brahms entered into business with his South African second cousin John Addison, a gay model who once dated Roy Cohn. Cohn was Donald Trump’s mentor who had close ties to the Reagan administration, as well as organized crime and sexual blackmail operations. Cohn was also closely linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families, and represented their bosses, Tony Salerno and Paul Castellano, respectively. Maurice Brahms and John Addison’s former regulars, Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager (son of Lansky associate Louis “Max the Jew” Schrager, a Brooklyn gambling boss), went on to open a direct competitor — Studio 54. As fate would have it, John Addison had introduced the pair to Cohn, who would later become Studio 54’s lawyer. Addison’s introduction of Rubell and Schrager to Cohn set in motion a series of events that later led to Addison’s and Maurice Brahms’ incarceration. Schrager and Rubell approached Cohn for his help in blocking the opening of Brahms’ and Addison’s new club New York, New York in 1977. Cohn, in turn, enlisted then-Assistant District Attorney Peter Sudler and Special Agent Mark Britt from SDNY in a sting operation. Brahms’ and Addison’s establishment was raided under the auspices of perjured search warrants. This then led to raids at their respective homes. Agents reportedly illegally seized a ledger that showed that the pair had been skimming $1.3 million from the Infinity, the club where the cousins first encountered Schrager and Rubell (who subsequently also served prison time for similar crimes related to their nightclubs). Brahms and Addison were ultimately pressured into pleading guilty. Brahms was sentenced to 3 years in prison in NYC. Maurice Brahms’ final club was the aforementioned Red Zone, where Combs hosted his Uptown Record-era mixers. Given Combs’ association with these elements of the New York nightclub scene, the more recent revelation of Combs’ later bisexual “Freak Off” orgies becomes far less shocking. While his “Freak Off” parties are now notorious, the much earlier Combs-hosted events at Red Zone also developed quite a reputation. For instance, Combs promoted a recurrent party at the Red Zone called “Daddy’s House” that explicitly catered to a hip-hop audience. Apparently violence was so endemic and frequent at these events that Combs routinely had to interrupt the DJs to talk people down and, at one point, even wrote to everyone on his mailing list in an attempt to plead with them to leave the quarrels and weapons at home. Per reports, the violence continued unabated and Red Zone ultimately lost its liquor license following a shooting that occurred outside the venue. A fellow hip hop party promoter named Toi Sojer contradicted Combs’ claims that he was not responsible for any of the violence at these events, stating that, “Puffy’s parties are scary. I was always frightened when I went to Red Zone.” While throwing “scary” parties at venues with suspect owners, Combs is now alleged to have begun engaging in acts of sexual violence while at Uptown. Recent lawsuits additionally assert that other figures (and companies) tied to Uptown were directly related to those crimes. On November 23, 2023, just before the expiration of the NY State Adult Survivor’s Act (which created a window free of the statute of limitations during so that adult victims could pursue justice against their abusers), attorneys representing Liza Gardner filed a lawsuit alleging that, in 1990/1991, Combs and singer Aaron Hall took turns raping her and a friend after an MCA Records event in their corporate offices. The victim was allegedly only 16 years old at the time, while Combs was still working as a talent director at Uptown. Aaron Hall, like Combs, had significant ties to the Bronx, having grown up there, and was a member of the Uptown Records-signed band Guy with Teddy Riley, thus considered one of the architects of “new jack swing.” Further illustrating the ties between New Jack City and Uptown Records, Guy had a cameo as themselves in the film. Per the lawsuit, the alleged assault began one night when Combs and Hall were flirtatious and handsy with the reported victims at an MCA Records event. After the fete, the pair invited the two girls back to Hall’s apartment, where the men plied them with drinks and drugs before taking turns having sex with both friends. The lawsuit also alleges that Combs visited the home in which she and her friend were staying a few days after the incident. The visit allegedly turned violent, with Combs choking out Jane Doe, physically threatening her so as to impress upon her what might happen if she or her friend chose not to stay silent regarding their experience. It’s been speculated following the announcement of Gardner’s complaint that the lyrics to Aaron Hall’s song “Don’t Be Afraid”, released by MCA as one of the singles for the official soundtrack of Juice, may obliquely refer to the rape of Gardner. It was recently reported in the press that Aaron Hall is suddenly missing. According to Gardner and her attorney Tyrone Blackburn, they have exhausted all options as far as reaching Hall at his past known addresses, and will now have to resort to serving him summons via publication in newspapers of note. New evidence further suggests a culture of crime at Uptown and the label’s apparent enabling of Gardner’s mistreatment. Gardner recently amended her complaint after a sworn statement by the other woman who was reportedly raped at Hall’s New Jersey apartment (also a minor at the time) was entered. The unnamed woman claimed that DeVanté Swing, a member of the Uptown act Jodeci (whose career Combs was then managing) not only voyeuristically looked on as Gardner was raped by Combs, but that the two girls had been lured from North Carolina and were staying with Swing at his residence in NJ, which was allegedly “subsidized” by Uptown Records at the time. Swing was subsequently added to the lawsuit as a co-defendant. Furthermore, Swing’s alleged voyeurism of Gardner’s rape at the hands of Combs is in keeping with an abiding pattern of Combs’ sexual violence. Namely that, time and again, affiliates either watch his crimes, participate in them directly, or else view video footage of them after the fact. In Gardner’s filing, both MCA Records and Geffen Records are also named as co-defendants. David Geffen’s label had just been sold to MCA the same year that the assaults allegedly took place. Both Geffen and the now defunct MCA are owned by Universal Music Group (UMG) today, the major label crafted by the Bronfman family that is now overseen by Lucian Grainge, a former MCA and CBS Records executive. Both Lucian Grainge and UMG were initially named as co-defendants in Rodney Jones’ lawsuit against Sean Combs for enabling his sex trafficking activities. Also in November 2023, Joi Dickerson-Neal filed the second of three sexual assault lawsuits that targeted Combs in the span of that week. Dickerson-Neal had graced a music video opposite Combs in 1990. Dickerson-Neal has stated that her proximity to Combs in the video spurred a warning from Sister Soulja, who had told the young woman to keep her distance from Combs. Dickerson-Neal claims that she surrendered to Combs’ constant advances in 1991, reluctantly agreeing to a dinner date. She insisted, however, that they meet at Wells Restaurant in Harlem, her place of employment at the time, due to concerns about Combs, hoping that the presence of coworkers would help her feel more secure. In the filing, Dickerson-Neal contends that Combs spiked her beverage while she’d excused herself to the restroom. When they left the premises, she claims he forced her to take a hit from a blunt, and that the combined impacts of the drugging left her legs feeling “rubbery.” She alleges that Combs then drove her to a nearby “studio” (most likely affiliated with either Uptown/MCA) and then raped her at a residence in the neighborhood seemingly owned by an acquaintance of both individuals, during which he filmed her violation. Following these traumatic events, Jodeci singer DeVanté Swing allegedly revealed to the victim that Combs had filmed her rape and was playing the footage for everyone at the “studio” like some kind of perverse trophy. If true, this would mean that myriad Uptown employees saw this video. This is one of the earliest allegations that involves Combs and the non-consensual films of sexual assault and rape crimes. It also alludes to the possible collection of sexual blackmail compiled by Combs –– a pattern that would repeat in subsequent allegations in the lead up to his 2024 incarceration. Eventually, Andre Harrell felt Combs was getting too “cocky” in his position at Uptown and fired him in 1993. Nevertheless, the two remained friends, with Harrell becoming the godfather to Combs’ son Justin, who was born later that same year. Combs, shortly after leaving Uptown, created Bad Boy Records with Kirk Burrowes in 1993. Combs’ new label quickly entered into a distribution deal with Arista Records worth $15 million. Davis says he met Combs when Combs was 23 years old and that, soon after meeting, Davis “helped introduce [Combs] to the right music executives who could assist him in ushering in ‘the forthcoming Hip Hop revolution.’” Bad Boy Records’ prolonged success was ensured by its early deal with Arista (which later expanded into a joint venture) as well as the man who would become Combs’ second record mentor in the music industry, Arista’s founder and president Clive Davis. Davis’ Arista was originally founded as part of Columbia Pictures’ music label portfolio. At the time Arista entered into its joint venture with Combs’ Bad Boys, the label had been sold by Columbia Pictures to BMG, a German media company. However, Davis controlled Arista as if it were his own personal fiefdom until 2000, when he left the label due to BMG’s age restriction policy for executives. Bad Boy Records ended what had then become a joint venture with Arista a few years after Davis’ departure. Shortly thereafter, Bad Boy attached itself to Bronfman-controlled interests in the music industry, which will be revisited in Part II of this series. Clive Davis grew up in Crown Heights, the son of a middle-class Jewish electrician and salesman. He excelled at Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the New York City branch of the National Honor Society dubbed Arista, which would later serve as inspiration for the name of his label at Columbia Pictures. His early academic success earned Davis a full scholarship to New York University. He then attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1956. Two years following his graduation, Davis joined “…the large, white-shoe firm, Rosenman, Colin, Kaye, Petschek, and Freund. Sam Rosenman was counsel to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman; Ralph Colin’s clients included William Paley and CBS.”xvi Other notable clients of Rosenman & Colin LLP include two offshore banks owned by Bruce Rappaport that had served as “repositories of illicit funds from several illegal operations,” specifically related to drug trafficking. Rappaport, as noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, boasted close ties to the CIA, particularly via his close friend William Casey, as well as to Israeli intelligence and organized crime. Rappaport was particularly affiliated with organized crime networks that included Semion Mogilevich, an Eastern European mob boss who became a close business associate of Robert Maxwell in the late 1980s. Clive Davis’ storied career in the music industry began via his earlier career at Rosenman & Colin. While working at the firm (which –– as previously noted –– counted CBS as a client), Davis was hired to become assistant counsel of the CBS subsidiary, Columbia Records. He became the label’s general counsel a year later. Davis had been hired by Harvey Schein, a former colleague of Davis’ at Rosenman & Colin. Schien was a protégé of William Paley, the long-time head of CBS and “father of modern broadcasting.” Paley, the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, had worked building up CBS into the main network of radio and main record label in the United States, having a profound effect on mass media and the shaping of Americans’ musical tastes and political perceptions. During World War II, Paley served in the Office of War Information, becoming Chief of Radio of the U.S. military’s Psychological Warfare Division. Paley developed a very close relationship with scions of the Rockefeller dynasty, David and Nelson, as well as others close to the Rockefellers, like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. David Rockefeller and Kissinger both later eulogized Paley at his funeral in 1990, with Kissinger also serving as the chairman of Paley’s foundation. In the mid-1980s, Paley personally ensured that Laurence Tisch would take over CBS (including its record labels). As noted earlier in this piece, Tisch, in 1991, served as a founding member of the so-called “Mega Group” alongside Leslie Wexner, Charles and Edgar Bronfman and Lew Wasserman protégé Steven Spielberg, among others. Clive Davis’ infamous and undeniably “revolutionary” tenure as President of CBS Records (1967-1973) is most aptly characterized by the transition from the jazz, folk, and pop ethos of the 1950s to the industry-wide embrace of rock in the 1970s. Somewhat akin to the careers of Andre Harrell or Combs, he was a relatively young label executive well-placed to take advantage of shifting cultural trends, effectively making his name synonymous with an emergent genre for a time. In Davis’s self-hagiographizing, he had an epiphany at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and became determined to pivot to rock music. “I sensed change. I don’t know, even now, how I knew”.xvii Of course, this was an exaggeration, as rock had already been dominating the singles charts for more than a decade. Davis’ legacy in this period as it relates to rock music was essentially ensured after he poached an assembly of Monterey acts from their minor labels along with those who were still languishing in obscurity.xviii During his tenure at Columbia Records, Davis managed and/or signed Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, The Electric Flag, Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Chicago, Loggins & Messina, Aerosmith, Earth Wind & Fire, and the Grateful Dead. While Davis had been successful at CBS, he left the company under a cloud of scandal. Davis became a focus of an investigation led by the US Attorney’s Office in Newark, a probe that would later become known as Project Sound. As part of the investigation, “allegations began to surface in the press that CBS Records had bribed black radio stations and done business with an organized crime figure.” The scandal ultimately led to Clive Davis’ decision to make a deal in 1971 with two record producers tied to Motown Records, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff.xix Davis had sought out Gamble and Huff due to a desire to “conquer the R&B charts.” As part of the negotiations, Davis allowed Gamble’s and Huff’s company to promote the music that, per the deal, was produced and distributed by CBS. Perhaps unknown to Davis at the time, Gamble’s and Huff’s company and its promotional efforts engaged in the practice of payola, the illegal practice whereby firms pay radio stations to play singles without disclosing that payments were made. CBS was implicated in the arrangement through David Wynshaw, Clive Davis’ closest aide at CBS.xx Press reports soon stated that CBS music subsidiaries were being investigated for bribing radio stations, not just with money, but also drugs and sex, in order “to increase use of its products on black-oriented radio stations.” CBS, in connection with the Project Sound probe, uncovered that Davis had left a “trail of phony invoices” totaling at least $94,000 over six years that were meant to cover up Davis’ use of funds for personal parties and renovations to his properties.xxi Davis was ultimately fired by CBS as a result. Soon, the CBS “payola” scandal took on a darker hue. In February 1972, a few days after Davis had been fired from CBS, eight people were indicted in Newark on conspiracy and smuggling charges connected to a “multimillion dollar heroin ring operating in Italy, Canada, and the United States.” The connective tissue between CBS and this drug bust soon became apparent. A woman, recently fired from CBS for being “doped up” at work, had been indicted after working for a food stand that doubled as a front for the heroin ring in question. Patsy Falcone, aka Pasquale Falconio, an associate of the Genovese crime family, had also been indicted. Investigators found that Falcone also had a tie to CBS by way of his “friendship” with Davis’ protege David Wynshaw as well as via Frank Campana, a former CBS A&R man with whom Falcone had started a management company. Falcone and Campana’s company managed several acts signed to CBS. Investigators later stated that Davis’ name had been mentioned by Falcone in bugged telephone conversations and that evidence found on Falcone had listed Wynshaw as a “source for prostitutes.” Documents incriminating Wynshaw were reportedly found on Falcone at the time of his arrest. It was later reported that, “with the help of Dave Wynshaw, Falcone bilked CBS Records. The two men set up sham companies in… New Jersey… CBS unwittingly paid more than $75,000 to these nonexistent operations.”xxii Wynshaw figured prominently into Davis’ downfall as it was Wynshaw who had both helped facilitate the money funneled to Falcone and who had written up false invoices that obscured the payments that Davis had used for personal enrichment. It was also believed that Wynshaw’s role involved laundering money that was used for “off-the-record” items, like procuring drugs and prostitutes for CBS parties, conferences, & artists, leading him to be colloquially known as “Clive’s pimp” at the label. As a Rolling Stone article from the period speculated based on industry rumors at the time, Davis’ unceremonious firing by CBS over personal enrichment and embezzlement of funds (of $94,000, then deemed paltry by industry insiders) may have been a strategic attempt to get ahead of the larger “Drugola” scandal and the possibility that federal investigators might pursue charges against Davis, his trusted aide Wynshaw, and others at the company. Despite the scandal, Davis quickly found his way back into the industry. A little over a year after having been fired from CBS/Columbia, in the summer of 1974, Davis was hired as a consultant for Bell Records, “a barely profitable subsidiary of Columbia Pictures (no corporate relation to CBS).” According to a 1977 New York Times article, “Davis’s consulting took the form of letting go most of [Bell’s] performers and the executives who had signed them, retaining only a handful as the basis for a renamed company, Arista, with himself in the president’s chair.” Arista’s formation and success relied heavily on Alan Hirschfield, a major entertainment executive who had recently become CEO of Columbia Pictures. Hirschfield was instrumental in bringing Davis on as a consultant for Bell and who supported Davis’ formation of Arista. Davis, as well as Hirschfield’s family, have framed Hirschfield as having essentially co-founded the label with Davis. Hirschfield had found himself serving in the top post in Columbia Pictures thanks to the same connection that saw him become at top executive at other entertainment conglomerates, like Fox and Warner Brothers. That connection was to Allen & Company, as Hirschfield’s father Norman was a close friend and associate of Charles and Herbert Allen, the founders of the company. Norman Hirschfield also worked for Allen & Co., particularly in its natural gas division and also in scouting other “business opportunities” for the firm. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, when Allen & Co. took a stake in a major entertainment firm, Columbia included, they ensured their interests were represented through the installation of Norman’s son, Alan Hirschfield, in a top executive post. Charles and Herbert Allen and their firm Allen & Co. have documented ties to intelligence-linked figures and scandals, as well as organized crime. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the Allen brothers had significant organized crime connections, particularly via companies based in the Bahamas that were run and developed by close associates of Jewish mobster and co-founder of the National Crime Syndicate, Meyer Lansky. In addition, Allen & Co. was a client of the CIA-linked David Baird Foundation and Charles and Allen and David Baird had several dealings with an associate of mob boss Moe Dalitz and Alexander Guterma, who was a key part of the United Dye scandal that had also ensnared figures like Roy Cohn. Allen & Co. also financed Earl Brian’s efforts to buy out Inslaw Inc. as part of the PROMIS scandal (discussed in greater detail shortly) and had other close business ties to Brian, including being significant shareholders in Brian’s company Hadron. The Allen brothers also had significant ties to Leslie Wexner’s mentors, Max Fisher and Alfred Taubman. Taubman had been close to the Allens since the 1950s. For Fisher, the connection was forged at the time he was heading up United Brands, the CIA-linked company that Fisher took over the same year that its former top executive, Eli Black, suspiciously fell to his death from the 44th floor of the Pan Am building in Manhattan. Black was the father of Leon Black, the Drexel Burnham Lambert executive who would later found Apollo Global Management and become a very close and now notorious associate of Jeffrey Epstein. While still at United Brands, Fisher joined Taubman and the Allen brothers in a joint venture that culminated in the takeover of the Irvine Ranch in California. The overlap doesn’t end there. Columbia Pictures’ Alan Hirschfield was a close associate of lawyer Allen Tessler and served alongside Tessler as a top executive at Data Broadcasting Corporation. Tessler was the family lawyer for the organized crime-linked Gouletas family and their real estate empire. Tessler also later joined the board of Leslie Wexner’s The Limited in 1987. Evangeline Gouletas shared an office space with Epstein during this time, which also coincides with the development of the close-knit relationship between Wexner and Epstein. Another key client of Tessler’s was the aforementioned Earl Brian, who had close ties to Allen & Co. and was one of the masterminds of the PROMIS scandal that involved MCA, organized crime, US intelligence and Israeli intelligence (with Robert Maxwell facilitating aspects of the scheme on behalf of Israel). Tessler’s law firm, Shea & Gould, also represented organized crime clients like Carmine de Sapio, a close friend of Roy Cohn’s, and also had significant connections to William Casey, Reagan’s CIA director. Tessler, who was chairman of Wexner’s The Limited’s Finance Committee by 1990, came into direct contact with Epstein some time around this period as well. Tessler appears in Epstein’s infamous “black book” with two addresses and four different phone numbers listed. Among the numbers listed is Tessler’s line at Data Broadcasting, where he and Hirschfield worked side-by-side. The company had been acquired by Earl Brian’s firm Infotechnology in 1987. In other words, Clive Davis’ ascent to become a major music executive was aided largely by figures tied to same clandestine network composed of intelligence-linked and organized crime elements that also forms the basis for the network that would also later figure prominently in the rise of Jeffrey Epstein. This is also evident in Davis’ close friendship with the family of the Mega Group’s Laurence Tisch, particularly his nephew Jonathan who took over the family business Loews Corp in 1989. This connection later led Davis to donate several million to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, producing the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music under the Tisch School umbrella. It is also notable that the “drugola” scandal linked to Davis had ties specifically to the Genovese crime family, an organized crime network also linked to MCA, Morris Levy, Roy Cohn and Leslie Wexner, as noted earlier in this piece. After the scandal around Combs began to break, Clive Davis, as well as Andre Harrell of Uptown and Russell Simmons of Def Jam/Rush Management, have been accused of propelling Combs into the patterns of criminal behavior for which he is now infamous. For instance, one-time rival (and former friend of Combs) Suge Knight has claimed that Davis, Harrell and Simmons used “alcohol, drugs” – specifically cocaine – to “compromise” Combs’ “manhood.” This is particularly significant in the case of Davis’ ties to the “Drugola” scandal, which involved using sex, drugs and bribes to specifically target “black-oriented radio stations” and music. Claims similar to those made by Knight have since been echoed by Combs’ former bodyguard Gene Deal. It is worth noting here that Davis’ protégé L.A. Reid, who took over Arista Records from Davis, has also been accused of sexual misconduct and assault. Reid, alongside Combs, were both instrumental in the success of recording artists Justin Bieber and Usher. Knight has argued that Davis, Simmons and Harrell first “compromised” Combs and then Combs went on to use alcohol, drugs, and gay sex to “control” younger artists like Usher and Bieber. Notably, Combs’ entry into the world of Andre Harell, Simmons and, shortly thereafter, Clive Davis, coincides with the development of his obsessive drive to record everything, presumably for blackmail-related purposes. For instance, music video director Cole Bennett asserted that Combs told him that he’d begun recording “footage of everything” in 1992 and even advised Bennett to do the same. In addition, Kirk Burrowes, the co-founder of Bad Boy Records with Combs, has claimed that Combs sought to compromise him using this same method. Burrowes has filed a lawsuit against Combs, claiming Combs subjected him to “repeated sexual harassment, physical aggression and forced compliance with degrading sexual acts” throughout the 1990s. Burrowes claims that Combs targeted him with “unwanted sexual advances” including acts of “nudity, sexual overtones, voyeurism and acts of exhibitionism,” some of which allegedly took place during business meetings, and that this was part of a larger “campaign of control.” The outcome of this campaign, per Burrowes, was the use of “physical violence, blackmail, career sabotage and financial extortion” to force Burrowes out of his 25% stake in Bad Boy Records. Though Davis was a key part of the early creation and formation of Bad Boy Records, he is not named in Burrowes’ suit. However, Combs may have been “controlled” in a similar way by Davis, per some sources. Suge Knight, for instance, has alleged that he was told by the former head of Interscope Records, Jimmy Iovine, that Combs had regularly engaged in sexual acts with Davis, suggesting that his relationship with Davis and Davis’ early, crucial involvement with Bad Boy were built on the back of sexual favors. This is certainly possible given the well-known mechanism within the entertainment industry of sexual favors as a way to secure lucrative roles and deals –– e.g. the Harvey Weinstein scandal. In addition, Davis notably came out publicly as bisexual in a memoir published when he was 80 years old, where he writes that he began to openly engage in sex with the same gender in the 1980s. Combs’ alleged bisexuality has been a major topic of discussion in relation to the scandal leading up to his arrest last year. Knight has also claimed that Russell Simmons and Andre Harrell had also engaged in similar behavior with each other. Notably, the network behind Clive Davis, which overlaps with that behind Epstein, also involved similar “sugar daddy”-style relationships. These include rumors that Epstein and his long-time benefactor Leslie Wexner were intimate, e.g. former State of Ohio Inspector General David Sturtz telling journalist Bob Fitrakis that Epstein was Wexner’s “boyfriend.” Given that Russell Simmons is one of the men alleged to have mentored Combs in this type of criminal behavior, it is worth taking a look also at some of the recent allegations that have been made against Simmons and some of his associates, who – like Simmons – also boasted close ties to Combs. Beginning in 2017, Russell Simmons was hit with a slew of rape and sexual harassment lawsuits and accusations. One of Simmons’ earliest accusers, model Keri Claussen Khalighi, alleged that Simmons raped her in full view of the director Brett Ratner in 1991. Before the 2017 allegations, police had previously probed Simmons and Ratner for claims of jointly engaging in sexual battery back in 2001. Over a dozen women have since accused Simmons of sexual misconduct or crimes, while Ratner himself has been separately accused of similar crimes, including rape, by at least 10 women. Following the barrage of accusations, Simmons has laid low in Bali, Indonesia, embracing life as a “stateless” US citizen in a bid to evade the court’s jurisdiction. As will be explained in greater detail shortly, Ratner fled to Israel but is now planning a comeback, currying favor with the Trump family to that effect. Ratner is a long-time close associate of Simmons, with some reports calling Ratner a “protégé” of Simmons. Simmons is credited with helping start Ratner’s career, as the two met while Ratner was still in film school (NYU’s Tisch School) and Ratner began filming music videos for Simmons-managed artists like Public Enemy soon after their meeting. Ratner also filmed a music video for Combs’ longtime associate Heavy D, who had first gotten Combs his internship at Uptown, in 1994. Getty images alone hosts hundreds of photographs of Ratner and Simmons partying together over the years. Ratner, like Simmons, was also a very close associate of Combs, bringing Combs as his guest to several premieres of his films. Ratner was also a frequent attendee of numerous Combs-hosted parties as well as charity fundraisers. They also arrived together at prominent award shows and Ratner also filmed music videos for Combs, such as his 2001 single “Diddy.” Combs selected Brett Ratner and Ron Burkle, among others, to be his guests of honor when he delivered a commencement address to his alma mater Howard University in 2014. Ratner’s close association with both Simmons and Combs is notable for a few reasons. First, there is the fact that Ratner, as previously mentioned, was accused by several actresses of sexual misconduct, resulting in him being dropped from his agency and the “canceling” of his Hollywood career. In addition, Ratner took over directing the X-Men series from Bryan Singer, with whom Ratner is reportedly close. Singer has been accused of pedophilia and sordid affiliations with the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), which was run by pedophile Marc Collins-Rector and also involved child star turned crypto mogul Brock Piece. (For Unlimited Hangout’s past reporting on DEN and Pierce, see here) Second, there is the man that Ratner considers his father –– Alvin Malnik. The feeling is apparently mutual, with Malnik referring to Ratner as one of his sons. The close-knit tie is telling as Malnik has very significant organized crime ties, particularly to Meyer Lansky. Not only that, but according to a Forbes investigation cited by the LA Times, Malnik “invented the black art of money-laundering, taking mob money and routing it to legitimate ventures.” Forbes wrote that: In the 1960s, Miami lawyer Alvin Malnik set up the Bank of Commerce in the Bahamas. Mob money flowed into its secret numbered accounts by the hundreds of millions–[mob financier Meyer] Lansky money, most of it–and then out again into Tibor Rosenbaum’s International Credit Bank of Switzerland before returning to the United States for investment. For those familiar with One Nation Under Blackmail, both Lansky and Rosenbaum also had significant ties to the Israeli intelligence apparatus, especially Rosenbaum who helped finance keys aspects of Israeli intelligence, including via the means that Malnik reportedly helped to develop. In addition, Malnik’s other ties to Lansky were considerable. For instance, Malnik had previously been banned from working in New Jersey casinos due to state regulators confirming his ties to Lansky and Sam Cohen, another mobster. Malnik had even been named Lansky’s “heir apparent” by Reader’s Digest upon Lansky’s 1983 death, while the Miami News noted that Lansky had wanted Malnik to take over all of his “legitimate enterprises” after this death. That article also cited federal agents that claimed that Malnik also stood to inherit “Lansky’s lucrative gambling, pornography, prostitution, labor racketeering and extortion operations.” Malnik also had a close association with Joel Steinger, a notorious fraud that operated a massive Ponzi scheme targeting the elderly and terminally ill. Steinger, like Malnik, had developed close ties to Lansky personally by the 1970s and married the daughter of a Miami banker alleged to be a close Lansky associate. In addition, Malnik was involved in strange ways with Michael Jackson in his later years. As noted previously, billionaire Ron Burkle ––- who also cultivated close ties to Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, along with Combs himself –– had significant connections to Jackson during this same period. The Malnik-Burkle-Jackson connection, as well as Burkle’s significant ties to both Epstein and Combs, will be covered in Part II of this series. Malnik’s own “protégé,” his adopted son Brett Ratner, claims to have also fostered a close relationship early on with Meyer Lansky himself. In a 2011 interview, Ratner stated the following: “I grew up on Miami Beach. I lived on Collins Avenue at the Carriage House on 54th Street. And two doors down was the Imperial House where every day after school I would ride my bike and I would walk down the street with an old man who would walk his dog. We would walk together and everyone at the store would kiss my ass when I was with him. He would take me to this restaurant called the Villa Capri and everybody was always treating me so nice. I didn’t realize it until I was in line at the supermarket with my mom and I opened up Rolling Stone and I saw his picture on the back. It was Meyer Lansky’s obituary. Everybody thought it was weird because he was 80 and I was 12. He was the biggest gangster in the world and he was like my best friend as a kid.” While some may discount this claim as fantasy on Ratner’s part, his close ties to Malnik –– Lanksy’s “heir” –– during the same period of his alleged association with Lansky lends the story credence. In addition, it is worth noting that Ratner’s “big break” that allowed him to become a famous director came somewhat unexpectedly in his “mediocre” film school career via Steven Spielberg. As previously noted, Spielberg was a protégé of Wasserman and Schienberg of MCA, a company with significant mob (and intelligence) affiliations, while Wasserman himself was connected to Lansky’s network via his long-time tie to Lansky associate Moe Dalitz. Spielberg is also a reported member of the previously mentioned “Mega Group” that unites Spielberg with organized crime-linked oligarchs like Epstein’s main benefactor Leslie Wexner, among others. Ratner would later follow the Lansky model of evading charges and scrutiny for illegal activities by immigrating to Israel. After he was accused of extreme sexual misconduct, including alongside Simmons, Ratner fled to Israel. A week before his escape, Ratner had been Benjamin Netanyahu’s special guest, along with former Epstein defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, at the United Nations. Articles on Ratner’s trip to the UN with Netanyahu noted that Ratner is a former close business associate of Australian media tycoon James Packer, who has been closely linked to Netanyahu. Packer’s business venture with Ratner, RatPac Entertainment was notably partnered for several years with Dune Entertainment, the film business of Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Mnuchin left the venture shortly after joining the first Trump administration, which coincided with many of the accusations against Ratner being made public, crippling the firm’s once meteoric rise. Packer, for his part, was a key part of the corruption trial that continues to dog current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but has taken a backseat following the onset of the Israel-Gaza War in October 2023. Packer’s ties to both Netanyahu as well as former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen were deemed so extensive that they were considered a “national risk” in court testimony. Packer also once threatened to “sic” Mossad operatives on businessmen and was seeking to form a cybersecurity venture with Mossad-linked individuals around the same time he created RatPac with Brett Ratner. In addition, Packer was known to have partied with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including on the yacht of Australian trucking magnate Lindsay Fox in 1995 when Epstein and Maxwell were the “guests of honour” on the cruise. Furthermore, Packer has also come under scrutiny for his ties to Stanley Ho, a casino magnate with ties to Chinese organized crime and to the Clinton-era scandal “Chinagate,” which also involved Epstein. As it relates to Epstein, a star in many of Ratner’s films with close social ties to the director, Chris Tucker, would later find himself on infamous Epstein-brokered plane trips alongside Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey. The Combs-Simmons-Ratner clique have a history of cultivating ties to Donald Trump. For instance, one image photographed by Getty shows Ratner on stage with Combs at Russell Simmon’s “Art for Life Palm Beach” event honoring Combs in 2005. The event was hosted at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago and attended by the Trumps. The Trumps also attended some premieres of Ratner’s films. Trump became closely associated with Combs beginning in the 1990s. While those ties will be discussed in detail in Part II of this series, it is worth noting that First Lady Melania Trump has teamed up with the self-exiled Ratner, who is now directing a documentary about her life that is due to launch on Amazon Prime later this year. The First Lady is an executive producer of the film, which began production shortly after her husband’s 2024 election win. In addition, according to New York magazine, Ratner was recently seen visiting Mar-a-Lago along with the aforementioned James Packer, where they were photographed dining with Trump and Elon Musk earlier this year. A month later, it was reported that Packer bought a Trump-owned property neighboring both Mar-a-Lago’s private club and the Trump estate there. The property was previously used by close Trump associates visiting Mar-a-Lago and by the Secret Service during his first presidential term. Ratner has reportedly been involved in “fanning” the closeness between Trump and Packer that resulted in the property sale. Notably, Packer had previously bought a property neighboring another state leader, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, back in 2016. In addition, Ratner and the Trump family, as well as Russell Simmons, were among the guests invited to the wedding of Al Malnik’s son, Jarod Malnik, in early 2024. Ultimately, in tracing the network in which Combs had become deeply enmeshed by the early and mid-1990s, we are left with deep connections to intelligence-linked elements of organized crime. This same network of organized criminals also played a key part in enabling the activities of sex criminal and intelligence asset Jeffrey Epstein, from at least the 1970s onward, as detailed in the book One Nation Under Blackmail. With such connections established, the question then becomes –– what did this group seek in someone like Sean Combs, and more broadly, in exerting its influence over the entertainment industry and specifically African-American music? While speculative, it appears that various connections leading back to MCA and its influence can help us arrive at one unsettling possibility. During this period, not only was MCA a dominant force in entertainment (and early hip-hop specifically), but Laurence Tisch –– through his 1985 takeover of CBS –– controlled another key branch of the music industry through 1995. With the Bronfmans taking over MCA, and later Def Jam and Warner Music (as will be noted in Part II), the influence of the so-called “Mega Group” billionaires over the music industry became extremely significant during the 1990s. With Combs teaming up with Clive Davis, with significant ties to this same network, to form his own label Bad Boy Records in 1995, this tiny group of billionaires had the ability to shape hip-hop, the cultural engine of the African-American community, in major ways. The same year that the Bronfman and Tisch clans formally joined forces with Leslie Wexner and others like MCA-linked Steven Spielberg via the “Mega Group,” American record labels had allegedly begun to conspire to promote crime in hip-hop lyrics with the ostensible goal of facilitating the filling of private prisons, as those that ran the record labels were allegedly deeply connected to private prison firms. An account from an anonymous industry insider details how, in 1991, he was invited to a clandestine meeting where he was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement. He recounted the events of that meeting as follows: Quickly after the meeting began, one of my industry colleagues (who shall remain nameless like everyone else) thanked us for attending. He then gave the floor to a man who only introduced himself by his first name and gave no further details about his personal background. I think he was the owner of the residence but it was never confirmed. He briefly praised all of us for the success we had achieved in our industry and congratulated us for being selected as part of this small group of “decision-makers”. At this point, I begin to feel slightly uncomfortable at the strangeness of this gathering. The subject quickly changed as the speaker went on to tell us that the respective companies we represented had invested in a very profitable industry which could become even more rewarding with our active involvement. He explained that the companies we work for had invested millions into the building of privately owned prisons and that our positions of influence in the music industry would actually impact the profitability of these investments. I remember many of us in the group immediately looking at each other in confusion. At the time, I didn’t know what a private prison was but I wasn’t the only one. Sure enough, someone asked what these prisons were and what any of this had to do with us. We were told that these prisons were built by privately-owned companies that received funding from the government based on the number of inmates. The more inmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also made clear to us that since these prisons are privately owned, as they become publicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares. Most of us were taken back by this. Again, a couple of people asked what this had to do with us. At this point, my industry colleague who had first opened the meeting took the floor again and answered our questions. He told us that since our employers had become silent investors in this prison business, it was now in their interest to make sure that these prisons remained filled. Our job would be to help make this happen by marketing music that promotes criminal behavior, rap being the music of choice. He assured us that this would be a great situation for us because rap music was becoming an increasingly profitable market for our companies, and as employees, we’d also be able to buy personal stocks in these prisons. Immediately, silence came over the room. You could have heard a pin drop. While efforts have been made over the years to dismiss this account as fantasy and/or conspiracy (despite it being deemed credible and promoted by prominent figures in hip-hop), other accounts from this period suggests that it should not be so easily discounted. For instance, Portia Maultsby, Professor Emerita of Folklore and Ethnomusicology at Indiana University, has been quoted as stating that: In the early 1990s, a former graduate student, then keyboardist for Stevie Wonder, called me upset that some record labels were actively recruiting Black men with criminal records to record rap. He believed that they were encouraging criminal acts among this group. In addition, prominent rappers have claimed, from the 1990s onward, that the music industry is financially entangled with the private prison industry and encourages “criminal behavior” through hip-hop due to those entanglements. While some outlets have noted that private prison companies and record labels share major index managers like Vanguard among their top shareholders, the ties between the two industries are significantly deeper and directly involve organizations mentioned throughout this article. Clinton, not unlike Ronald Reagan, was very “under the thumb” of MCA’s Lew Wasserman. Wasserman began backing Clinton’s presidential campaigns in 1992, but had first met Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas, where his administration notoriously enabled illicit Iran-Contra-linked activities. Lew Wasserman would later broker the close ties between Clinton and his grandson, Casey Wasserman (who like Clinton, was an Epstein associate). This led to the Wasserman Foundation becoming one of the main donors to the controversial Clinton Foundation. Wasserman, as well as his protégé Steven Spielberg, were major donors to Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, so much so that it earned them overnight stays in the White House’s Lincoln bedroom. In addition, other Mega Group figures like Edgar Bronfman were also major donors to Clinton. Bronfman and Wasserman both received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during Clinton’s presidencies. Notably, companies tied to Bronfman and Wasserman, i.e. MCA/Universal, played a major role in lobbying for the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which Clinton signed into law and which allowed extreme industry consolidation and the formation of de facto monopolies in entertainment and beyond. A few years earlier, in 1994, Bill Clinton had signed a controversial crime bill which enacted several “funding incentives blamed for driving mass incarceration.” Though mass incarceration existed before the 1994 crime bill (largely beginning in the administration of the MCA-controlled Ronald Reagan), that bill is blamed with exacerbating the crisis, which has disproportionately impacted the African-American community and benefited two companies in particular. Those two companies were the biggest private prison companies in the United States at the time, and they still are today. One was the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), now known as CoreCivic, while the other was Geo Group, formerly Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC). Notably, WCC’s IPO took place the same year as the passage of the crime bill, 1994, which notably coincides with the account of the 1991 clandestine meeting where it was claimed that the private prison companies would go public once the music industry had began to promote violence and crime in hip-hop lyrics for the benefit of private prison companies like Wackenhut. WCC was formed in 1984 as a subsidiary of the Wackenhut Corporation. WCC’s parent company, Wackenhut, developed significant ties to MCA during the 1980s. As detailed earlier, Wackenhut had entered into a joint venture with the Cabazon Reservation to covertly develop weapon systems for CIA-backed paramilitaries that also repurposed the PROMIS software for espionage purposes. Top MCA executive Eugene Gianquinto was directly involved with companies that later joined the Cabazon-Wackenhut operation and later took credit for quashing the federal investigation into MCA’s mob ties. In addition, Allen & Company and Earl Brian, who were connected with the PROMIS scandal, were also significantly tied to Alan Hirschfield, who is said to have co-founded Arista Records with Clive Davis, which spawned Combs’ Bad Boy Records in 1993. Evidence of MCA’s close ties to the CIA, beyond those indicated by the PROMIS scandal, were noted by Lew Wasserman biographer Dennis McDougal. McDougal received a response from the CIA, in response to a FOIA request, “that seventeen separate computer searches revealed MCA did work with the CIA. The CIA refused to release any of its MCA documents on grounds that it might endanger national security.” Melanie Carlson, writing for Covert Action Magazine, also thoroughly detailed MCA’s ties to the mob, the CIA, the PROMIS scandal and the death of journalist Danny Casolaro in a 2024 investigation. Like MCA, Wackenhut also had ties to the CIA. Between that point and the passage of the 1994 crime bill, figures like Frank Carlucci and Bobby Ray Inman, both former CIA deputy directors, served on Wackenhut’s board. Carlucci also had unusual connections to the network around Robert Booth Nichols, the organized crime-linked figure who had brought together Wackenhut, the Cabazon Indian reservation and MCA as part of the PROMIS scandal. In addition, before becoming Reagan’s CIA director William Casey, one of the October Surprise/Iran-Contra architects, had been Wackenhut’s outside legal counsel. In 1992, two years before the Clinton crime bill was passed, SPY Magazine reported on extensive ties between Wackenhut and the CIA, citing CIA operatives and former Wackenhut executives who noted that Wackenhut allowed the CIA to use its offices as fronts for its activities. The SPY investigation also noted how many of the figures who connected Wackenhut to the CIA were also key cogs in the Iran-Contra affair, which is also indicated by Wackenhut’s role in the PROMIS scandal. This is significant as some of those same figures tied directly to the CIA-Wackenhut connection, like Richard Secord, were also tied to Leslie Wexner and Jeffrey Epstein’s efforts to relocate the Iran-Contra airline of infamy, the CIA-linked Southern Air transport, to Columbus, OH for the express benefit of Wexner and his clothing empire. After Wexner and Epstein’s efforts were successful, the airline’s main flights were between Columbus and Hong Kong. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, that effort, which also coincides with Epstein’s most of his 17 visits to the Clinton White House, was explicitly considered by some Ohio law enforcement officials to be tied to clandestine and criminal activities, most likely arms trafficking given Epstein’s background in covert arms trafficking networks in the 1980s. In addition, Epstein’s main contact at the White House during that time, Mark Middleton, was a central part of the “Chinagate” scandal, one major aspect of which involved the smuggling of cheap Chinese weapons into American urban areas after Chinese gun imports were banned early on in the Clinton administration. Prior to that ban, the US had been China’s top market for guns. A significant cache of weapons being smuggled by this network into Oakland, CA was intercepted by the FBI in what is now remembered as Operation Dragon Fire, which was – at that point – the largest seizure of illegal automatic assault weapons in US history. The main individuals behind the illicit gun smuggling were tipped off and managed to flee the US prior to the FBI’s planned sting operation. However, the main company involved – China’s Norinco – had notable ties, not just to the “Chinagate” scandal itself, but also to Epstein’s former mentor and weapons dealer, Douglas Leese. The company was also allegedly involved with past arms deals that had involved both Leese and Epstein. In addition, when Clinton was serving as governor of Arkansas, he had significant connections to Iran-Contra-linked arms and drug trafficking, meaning he had a prior, documented history of enabling illicit arms smuggling operations while in public office and just prior to becoming US president. At the same time that Wackenhut and CIA-connected figures were apparently helping repurpose Iran-Contra assets for the sake of flooding the US black market with cheap yet illicit weapons, the same network was also littering US urban areas with drugs, specifically crack cocaine. As reported by the late Gary Webb in his iconic Dark Alliance series (and subsequent book of the same name), a massive drug ring in California was peddling crack cocaine specifically to Latino and African-American urban communities during the 1990s, with millions in profits being used to finance CIA-backed paramilitary groups in Nicaragua. It was argued at the time that this represented a continuation of the Iran-Contra nexus that came under scrutiny in the 1980s and the CIA’s clandestine efforts to finance the Nicaraguan “Contras” through illicit means. After Webb’s Dark Alliance series concluded, the outlet that had run it –– the San Jose Mercury News –– published an editorial noting that Webb’s work “can only feed longstanding rumors in black communities that the U.S. government ‘created’ the crack cocaine epidemic to kill and imprison African-Americans and otherwise wreak havoc in inner cities.” Central to the CIA-Contra-Crack Cocaine nexus were Nicaraguan asset and eventual DEA informant Oscar Danilo Blandón, one of the largest importers and suppliers of cocaine at the height of the crack epidemic, and his one-time business partner Freeway Ricky Ross, who hailed from Compton and who grew to operate an interstate crack ring that helped launder and finance the covert war on the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. In 1991, during one of his prison stints, Freeway Ricky Ross was cellmates with one of the other top crack dealers in Los Angeles, Michael “Harry O” Harris. As investigative researcher John Potash details in The FBI War on Tupac Shakur, Gary Webb asserted that Ross was effectively the national point man for the trafficking operations that were remotely manipulated by former Vice President Bush and CIA Director William Casey in the 1980s.xxiii His eventual cellmate Harry O was one of his top understudies. Potash writes: Other findings further support the notion that Death Row Records dually worked as a front company for various U.S. Intelligence operations. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Gary Webb was the first to link Death Row Records to the CIA from the record company’s inception. Webb quoted the probation officer of national crack trafficker Freeway Ricky Ross. That probation officer cited a silent partner of Death Row, a Michael “Harry-O” Harris, as one of Ross’ two understudies. New Yorker magazine and other media outlets described how Vice-President George Bush helped run key components of the CIA/Contra/Crack operations with CIA Director William Casey. Webb detailed the CIA cocaine trafficking network that went from Nicaraguan Contras, such as Danilo Blandón, to Freeway Ricky Ross. A CIA Inspector General backed these findings about the CIA trafficking cocaine in 1998. Webb claimed that Ross was their national point man, trafficking “multimillion-dollar cocaine shipments across America.” This would have made Michael Harris and Death Row Records important assets for the intelligence community. Evidence suggests that Ricky Ross worked closely with CIA-collaborating cocaine traffickers such as Danilo Blandón and Ron Lister in the ’80s. Also, at that time, Lister met regularly with former CIA Covert Operations director Bill Nelson, who had worked under George H. W. Bush at the CIA.xxiv Harry O would have become a silent partner in Death Row Records with Suge Knight, Dr. Dre, The D.O.C, and corrupt defense lawyer David Kenner.xxv This is significant to this story and the Sean “Diddy” Combs investigation at large, as not only was Death Row an intelligence front, but it was also teeming with dirty cops and corrupt informants who’d been assigned to moonlight as security guards at the label for drugs/weapons dealing, informing, and COINTELPRO purposes.xxvi This includes the intentional sabotage of the Bloods and Crips gang truce (both gangs with which Harry O intimately collaborated in his crack distribution efforts, as well as the Cali Cartel) and the fabrication and exploitation of the East vs. West rap feud that would ultimately lead to the seemingly government-sanctioned murders of both activist rapper Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, operations in which both Sean Combs and Suge Knight seemingly played pivotal roles. In Part II of this series, we will examine the East vs. West rap feud and the deaths of Tupac and Biggie, as well as their relevance to the Sean Combs story, in greater detail. More recently, Freeway Ricky Ross — now once again free after he successfully appealed his life imprisonment without the possibility of parole sentence on the grounds that the three strikes law had been misapplied — appeared on the podcast of hip hop journalist DJ Vlad and revealed that not only had he and Death Row silent partner Harry O been cellmates at the time that Michael Harris introduced Suge Knight to attorney David Kenner, but that Ross was initially going to be another “silent partner” in the label. According to Ross, this partnership only dissolved when he was released from prison prior to Harry O and got in contact with Suge Knight. Seemingly in order to protect his own drug-supplying stake in the Death Row enterprise, Michael “Harry O” Harris warned Ross off from working with Suge. Ross, in deference to street codes, declined to go behind Harry O’s back and supply Knight. Per Ross, back in 1991 at the time that Death Row was formed, he used to sit in at the no-contact visit meetings between Knight, Kenner, and Harris while he and Harris were incarcerated together. Once the label was up and running, it quickly turned to cocaine trafficking, arguably a branch or mutation of the same CIA-Contra-Crack Cocaine nexus for which assets like Freeway Ricky Ross and Michael Harris had earlier been burned and for which journalist Gary Webb was excessively attacked (and as some believe, murdered) to cover up. These music industry, organized crime, intelligence, and federal law enforcement connections are also hugely significant as Death Row –– in conjunction with Combs’ Bad Boy Records –– was one of the primary Trojan horses by which “gangster rap” was injected into the culture, often at the expense of more radical, activist or outright revolutionary hip hop acts who, if they refused to cater to the whims of certain record executives, would see their commercial prospects suffer. One of the mechanisms for the dissemination of drug and crime glorifying culture was the cruel and deliberate coercion and corruption of conscious rappers (see: Potash’s FBI War regarding Suge Knight’s pushing of drugs on both Dr. Dre, who’d previously preached abstinence, and Tupac).xxvii There is also the case of films like New Jack City, which involved Combs’ mentor Andre Harrell and arguably romanticizes crack dealing. The film was also made by Warner. Warner, as previously noted, was built out of the association of its long-time head, Steve Ross, with Meyer Lansky associates. Ross himself had become close to Robert Maxwell, an intelligence asset tied to organized crime and a key figure in the Epstein network as well as the PROMIS scandal, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a time when Maxwell was attempting to gain a foothold in New York City. This further suggests that mob-linked or mob-adjacent entertainment companies were working to culturally engineer African-American culture for the benefit of CIA-linked crack dealing and, ultimately, CIA-linked companies like Wackenhut that dominated the private prison industry. Given the above, all the elements of a perfect storm to perpetuate mass incarceration of African-Americans were put into place along the same timeline and by many of the same actors –– actors deeply tied to the CIA and organized crime. When we add the alleged efforts to stoke violence in hip-hop, as exemplified by Combs’ and his Bad Boy Records after he had become enmeshed in this very network as well as his West Coast rivals, we have yet another component that suggests this network used its influence over the hip-hop industry to socially engineer criminal behavior, while also ensuring that cheap, addictive drugs and cheap guns simultaneously flooded urban African-American communities. The MCA and CIA-connected Wackenhut would have reaped mass profits from this apparent operation, as the number of prisoners in its private prisons swelled. However, other major multi-national corporations who utilized inmate labor from these prisoners benefitted as well. A litany of American companies, like WalMart and Microsoft, are among those who have a long history of profiting handsomely from inmate labor. Several of these corporations include companies run by the “Mega Group” billionaires, like Lester Crown’s General Dynamics, a major military contractor, and Leslie Wexner’s Victoria’s Secret (though the lingerie firm claimed to have ended the contract after it became public knowledge in the late 1990s). This context certainly zooms out significantly from the specific Combs scandal that began to unravel at the end of 2023. However, it also helps us understand the case. Combs appears to have been brought into a network where he was controlled through sex and drugs, and then made a celebrity. As a celebrity, he used his own music, his record label and his influence to control other upcoming rappers and musicians while also helping shape the future of hip-hop toward that allegedly sought by music industry executives and their clandestine partners in the CIA, the mob and the private prison industry. Combs, from the early 1990s onward, appears to have been a key frontman for this network and its ambitions. He was likely not the sole mastermind or beneficiary of all of the scandalous parties, sexual violence, public promotion of violence, and alleged blackmail in which he engaged. He was a product of a network and a system that –– in the case of Combs –– was seeking to target and corrupt the broader African-American community in similar ways. Ultimately, Combs, like some other prominent entertainers, was servile to his music industry masters. He worked within a system those masters controlled and attempted to expand his own influence and power within that system, but –– at the end of the day –– he was never in charge. In the next installment of this series, we will explore Combs’ expanding influence in hip-hop and also in other industries, like retail, again all courtesy of the very same network outlined in this piece. While Combs publicly projected power and success, both of those things were conditional and, like Epstein, now exposed, he is due to take the fall in order to take the heat off of the people behind the curtain.

O’Malley-Greenburg, 3 Kings, Ch. I vi. The abuse charges against Fr. Lynch stemmed from an FBI probe launched in July 1987 (the summer prior to Combs departing for college) that was initiated after lay teachers at the academy complained about Lynch’s and Brady’s behavior with students. Fr. Lynch was jointly indicted around the same time as his boss Principal Brady, but was ultimately exonerated by the Hon. Justice Burton Roberts when a letter was produced during cross-examination that showed the FBI coerced student John Schaeffer into falsely accusing his former instructor under the false pretense that he wouldn’t be required to testify. There were also clear contradictions in the dates of the alleged abuse in Schaeffer’s testimony. Furthermore, as contended by Fr. Lynch’s defenders, the case against him was potentially politically motivated by his activism as well as other on-going corruption investigations in NYC including the Wedtech scandal, which first broke in 1986 and was named after a DOD-contractor based in the Bronx who secured governmental contracts through fraud, bribery, and other illegal means. The numerous scandals that beset New York municipal politics in the late 1980s led to Rudy Giuliani’s successful prosecution of Bronx Democratic Party leader Stanley Friedman on federal corruption charges. Friedman was a law partner of Roy Cohn, a notorious mob lawyer also known for having been Donald Trump’s mentor. Friedman’s protege, Bronx borough president Stanley Simon, resigned amid pending criminal charges stemming from his involvement with Wedtech. In 1988, long serving US Rep. Mario Biaggi of the Bronx was ultimately convicted by Giuliani on bribery, extortion, tax evasion, and obstruction charges in connection to Wedtech, shown to have accepted bribes from the Bronx company in return for the procurement of federal contracts. Bronx congressman Robert Garcia also resigned after Giuliani convicted him on bribery and extortion charges related to Wedtech in 1989—the ruling was later reversed on appeal. Note that the Wedtech and MSMA sex abuse scandals both revolved around the Bronx and that their court proceedings overlapped. While speculative, the FBI and DA office’s willingness to use dirty tricks in pursuit of a conviction of Fr. Lynch may have meant to distract from Wedtech, which was beginning to knock on the door of the Reagan administration, posing a danger to press secretary Lyn Nofziger and ultimately leading to AG Edwin Meese’s resignation in 1988. vii.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the witness stand on the first day of a historic antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations it illegally monopolized the social media market. The trial could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. WATCH: How Meta’s blockbuster antitrust trial could have major implications for big tech FTC attorney Daniel Matheson called Zuckerberg as the first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. At the trial, Matheson focused on a communication sent to colleagues that illustrated Zuckerberg’s frustration with a lack of progress on developing a photo-sharing app to compete with Instagram’s. “The way I read this message is that I’m not happy about how we’re executing on that project,” Zuckerberg said. Matheson followed up by asking if that was because of Instagram’s rapid growth. “That does seem to be what I’m highlighting,” Zuckerberg said, adding that he’s always urging his teams to do better. Later in the day, Zuckerberg appeared frustrated when Matheson asked him about his concerns expressed about how fast Instagram was growing. “I don’t have the full timeline of Instagram’s development in my head,” Zuckerberg said, when Matheson asked him about his mention of its growth. “You could probably get that better from somebody else.” Matheson also asked about comments of plans to keep Instagram running, while focusing on Facebook and not investing in Instagram. Zuckerberg said he wouldn’t characterize it as a plan, and he insisted that Instagram wasn’t neglected. “In practice, we ended up investing a ton in it after we acquired it,” Zuckerberg, who testified most of the afternoon, said. In opening statements, Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive. Support PBS News Hour now.

Title: PDD Holdings: A Chinese E-Commerce Gem Trading At A Deep Discount

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Every so often, the market overlooks a company delivering on all fronts, and PDD Holdings (PDD, Financial) might be one of them. The company has quietly become one of the most interesting disrupters and has built a global empire, turning its platforms, Pinduoduo and Temu, into household names across continents. Moreover, the numbers speak for themselves in terms of soaring revenue, rising profits, and a balance sheet that provides it the flexibility to keep winning. Yet, the stock remains extremely undervalued. That kind of disconnect does not last forever. Under an aggressive expansion strategy and having proven the ability to do just that, PDD Holdings is changing the game. And as the company grows continuously, this one of the most fascinating stories in the world of e-commerce will become difficult to ignore. For those who are paying attention now, it's an opportunity that's too big to miss out on. PDD Holdings, the owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, is a major player in global e-commerce. It's a socially driven shopping platform in China that started in 2015 and has since become a disruptive force in the industry with its aggressive pricing and speed of expansion. However, the real game-changer came in 2022 when PDD Holdings launched Temu. It is a cross-border marketplace that has taken the world by storm and is now live in over 40 countries. There is no accident to Temu's meteoric rise. Its success has spiked with bargain-basement prices and treasure-hunt shopping experiences selling to millions of cost-conscious consumers. Even I had a great experience with it, and to say the least, the app is addictive. However, the growth at this scale comes with challenges, which you will later see in the analysis. That said, PDD Holdings is doing more than sitting back. It is making smart moves to diversify its revenue. Its recent partnership with DigitBridge will enable it to bring small-to-medium-sized businesses and assist them in simplifying e-commerce operations so that sellers can seamlessly join Temu. It could serve as a strategic play to strengthen Temu's future position. Heading towards financial performance, PDD Holdings just reported another strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $15.15 billion. That is a good number, but it was less than expectations and has been the slowest growth rate since early 2022. However, the company's fundamentals are still strong. The healthy consumer demand manifested itself in a 33% increase in revenue from transaction services. Meanwhile, the company is keeping profitability up despite rising costs, as operating profit rose 14% to $3.5 billion and net income jumped a solid 18% to $3.76 billion. PDD Holdings Income Statement Breakdown Chart Balance sheet strength and cost concerns: Moreover, PDD Holdings is in an enviable position on the balance sheet. Today the company boasts a whopping $45.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and its cash-to-debt ratio is a staggering 30.13. That's a fortress-like balance sheet that allows it to be aggressive with the capital, while still being financially secure. Further adding to this, the debt levels remain minimal, which is a great sign. PDD Holdings Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart Thad said, rising costs posing concern. Cost of revenue rose 36%, and if that is to be the trend, it might put pressure on margins. But this is not a red flag yet. A core bull case for PDD Holdings is that it has consistently found ways to remain profitable, and this is supported so long as its e-commerce and grocery delivery businesses are strong. There was already some caution going in on this report. The previous quarter had seen YOY growth but a sequential decline, and even the management had warned about a possible dip in the profits. Yet, PDD Holdings delivered where it needed to, that is, in earnings growth. It is likely that the holiday season helped, but posting strong profits while absorbing rising costs is a sign of a tough company. Looking ahead, investors should keep a close eye on how the company balances the two: expansion with cost control. If PDD Holdings continues its earnings momentum and keeps costs under control, the current valuation discount would be a positive rather than a negative. Beyond Q4, PDD Holding's full-year performance is particularly impressive. With strong growth in both online marketing services up 29% YOY and an astounding 108% YOY spike in transaction services revenue to $26.84 billion, fiscal year 2024 was a blockbuster for it. It's obvious that the company's aggressive expansion is paying off. Still, more impressively, operating profit soared 85% YOY to $14.85 billion while net income climbed a mind-boggling 87% to $15.4 billion, indicating the company had pulled it off despite increasing costs. Speaking of costs, operating expenses jumped 35% YOY to $18.02 billion, probably due to high marketing spend, but PDD Holdings still managed to increase margins substantially. The company has plenty of financial firepower to keep on investing in growth with $16.7 billion in operating cash flow. There's no doubt that PDD Holdings is balancing aggressive expansion with profitability, but with raising fulfillment and payment processing costs, sustaining this momentum without killing margins is the real challenge ahead. PDD Holdings currently appears to be a hidden gem in the market. The stock is trading at a steep 55.86% discount based on its GF Value of $201.63 compared to its current stock price of $88.97. That’s a significant gap, especially considering the company’s robust earnings growth. PDD Holdings GF Value Chart As for valuation metrics, PDD Holding’s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.70 times is 38.83% below the sector median, and the forward P/E of 7.30 times is 44.81% below. In short, the stock is cheap, and even though it has delivered solid profits, the market may not be fully appreciating of the stock’s potential. Digging a bit further, enterprise-value-based multiples corroborate the story. PDD Holding’s forward EV/EBITDA of 4.44 times is at a 49% discount to the sector median of 8.72. Even more compelling is that its forward EV/EBIT of 4.42 times is at a 66% discount to the sector’s 13.11. These numbers reveal that PDD Holdings is not only profitable, but profitable at a valuation that seems quite modest. That said, there is one factor to watch. The company’s forward EV/Sales multiple of 1.21 times is 12.97% above the sector median of 1.07. It means investors are factoring in strong revenue growth already. If margins don’t come up to the levels of those expectations, then there could be some pressure on valuation. Ultimately, PDD Holdings has an amazing balance sheet and surging profitability, which makes the disconnect between its intrinsic value and the market price an opportunity to watch out for. Therefore, for now, the valuation screams opportunity, but execution will be the key here. Now, let’s compare MercadoLibre and Alibaba with PDD Holdings to determine who is a better value play out of the three. MercadoLibre is at a hefty premium, as its trailing P/E is 51.30 times and forward P/E almost 41.11 times, which is more than four times PDD Holding's valuation. While MercadoLibre's growth story is strong, that kind of premium pricing leaves close to no room for error. On the other hand, Alibaba’s trailing P/E of 11.94 times and forward P/E of 11.64 times are more reasonable but still slightly higher than PDD Holdings. The trend continues when we take a closer look at EV metrics. MercadoLibre's relatively high forward EV/EBITDA of 24.36 times and EV/EBIT (TTM) of 38.48 times indicate that there is a substantial premium. While EV/EBITDA at 8.17 times and EV/EBIT at 11.60 times for Alibaba is more moderate but again higher than PDD Holding’s levels. No matter how you slice it, PDD Holdings is trading at a discount. The gap remains wide on a revenue multiple basis. PDD Holding’s EV/Sales is a much lower figure than MELI’s 3.91 times or Alibaba’s 1.64 times. This makes it the most attractively valued of the three. PDD Valuation Ratio Comparison Chart When top investors make a move, it’s worth noting, and PDD Holdings has been on the radar of some big names. Institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Baillie Gifford have large positions in the company, while billionaire investor David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management has also been adding to its stake. It is a powerful vote of confidence in PDD Holding's long-term potential. PDD Holdings Volume of Guru Trades The latest activity on guru trades is leaning bullish. Despite some investors taking profits, there is a notable uptick in buying which suggests that smart money sees value. The strong accumulation that took place in late 2024 and early 2025, particularly when the stock dipped, is a sign of conviction rather than hesitation. Heavyweights are standing firm and building on top of their positions, attracting long-term investors. And as already mentioned, when top investors back something up, that is usually for a reason. PDD Holdings EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends With that, here is where I see PDD Holding's stock trading over the next year. Over the next three years, PDD's forward P/E is estimated to drop steadily, from 7.33 times in 2025 to 5.29 times in 2027. The fact that earnings are expected to see strong growth is captured in this downward trend, and the consensus EPS estimates support it. As EPS continues to accelerate, PDD Holding’s stock could be substantially undervalued at the current levels and that’s where the opportunity comes. We would see a significant re-rating and a solid upside if sentiment shifts and investors start recognizing PDD Holding’s momentum. Base case-A conservative valuation re-rating: If I take, for example, a 2025 EPS estimate of $7.33 and apply a 9-10x forward P/E, which is in line with PDD Holding’s historical valuation range, we reach a price target of $108.54 to $120.60. It’s about 22% to 36% upside from current levels. The assumption in this scenario is that the execution remains steady but the market could still be cautious with PDD Holdings, preventing its multiple from expanding more rapidly. Bull case-A stronger growth premium: But how PDD Holdings would react if investor sentiment improves? That’s where things get interesting. A 12-13 times forward P/E suddenly looks reasonable if the stock begins to get valued like some of its higher growth peers. If PDD Holdings were to trade at 12 times, it would be worth $144.72 and 13 times would result in $156.78, which is a 63-76% upside. To drive this out, PDD Holdings would need to continue its current earnings and margin expansion and have investors competent enough to have faith in its long-term trajectory. PDD Scenario Analysis Even in the worst-case scenario, PDD offers a modest upside. However, if things go right and the market sorts itself eventually, the gains would be high. GuruFocus analysts also believe that there is an upside of 73.37%, with bullish targets even higher. This is one of those setups where patience becomes the key, and for long-term investors, PDD Holdings is an opportunity waiting to be discovered. PDD Holdings 12 Month Analyst Price Target Chart Not even the best growth stories are without risk, and the same is true of PDD Holdings. Right now, regulatory scrutiny is one of the biggest concerns. Temu is probed for product safety violations and alleged labor violations related to the supply chain in the U.S. The sales tactics of the firm are also being considered red flags by European regulators. If these problems become worse, PDD Holdings could be fined, restricted in operations, or experience a loss of reputation, all of which are obstacles to its long-term growth. Another wildcard is China's regulatory environment. PDD Holdings is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) that allows foreign investment in Chinese companies. However, if Beijing goes too hard on this, PDD Holding's entire corporate setup could be at risk. And let’s not forget the competition. Alibaba and JD.com are already fighting back and slowing revenue growth. If PDD Holdings can't hold its edge, investors betting on its continued superiority may need to readjust their hopes. PDD Holdings is a compelling case being a high-growth, cash-rich e-commerce powerhouse trading at a steep discount. It is continuously executing, and delivering profitability even as it is aggressively investing. However, the market has not yet fully priced in its potential and that's the opportunity. There are risks, but they exist everywhere, isn't it? PDD Holdings has always been able to adapt and outperform. With earnings momentum still strong and institutional investors betting big, it is hard to ignore its upside. If the company stays on course, today's discount could become tomorrow's massive gain.

VMware's fall is leading organizations to explore alternative VDI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There has been increasing attention on open and closed technologies in relation to the development of AI and large language models (LLMs) in the past few years. Meta released Llama as open source, XAI released GROK-1 and, of course, the open source release of China’s DeepSeek model in recent months has been widely publicized. It’s evident that open source technology benefits from community adoption and development, enabling faster iteration, greater security testing and the contributions of many more active minds, experiences and skill sets. Whether the recent LLM releases are driven by such beliefs or by commercial instincts (likely both), it certainly helps in preventing a single player from dominating the market. This perspective was highlighted by the ironically named OpenAI trying to stifle DeepSeek adoption in recent weeks. Co-Founder at Inevidesk. The tensions of open versus closed technologies have long existed in less sensitive, yet still important, areas. Closed technologies tend to be much more widely adopted as they are more easily packaged and deployed and require less depth of expertise. This can lead to monopolies of the type exemplified by Microsoft or Adobe, whose dominance stifles any real competition; the sheer weight of users and finances might preclude serious challenges. In other areas there might not be monopolies, but still a general market domination by a handful of vendors. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a good example, where VMware and Citrix have shared the spoils for many years. And if their dominance has been challenged in recent years, this has been due to the growth of cloud hyperscalers which, for the most part, were extensions of existing global, powerful big tech such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. This state of play is starting to shift somewhat, driven in part by dissatisfaction and distrust of the cloud giants (almost certainly concentrated further by their involvement in AI). This is causing many organizations to ‘reshore’ on-premises or cloud hosted in their own private data center. This dissatisfaction has been fueled by the slow collapse of VMware - perhaps the most well known and widely used of the legacy VDI vendors. VMware was purchased by Broadcom in November 2023, who almost immediately announced several changes including the divestment of their end user computing (EUC) which included Horizon VDI services. The EUC business was subsequently purchased by KKR, a global investment firm, that now offers VDI services under the ‘Omnissa’ brand. The lack of interest shown by Broadcom in the EUC service is a huge knock in confidence for the continued viability of this model, which is not profitable enough for them. It’s uncertain whether the software can be revived under new ownership and there have been worrying indications. Last year, Gartner warned of uncertainty regarding Omnissa’s roadmap and continued semi-dependence for many users on other VMware products. Concerns are currently compounded by recent large-scale layoffs which in one sense should be expected as a post-sale reconstruction, but of course could easily result in the loss of critical internal expertise and a drop in service levels. The recent upheaval has also caused issues concerning price increases and significantly lengthy waits for renewal quotations. Such concerns are driving customers towards other options and, with Citrix remaining complex and expensive and certainly out of the reach of many SMEs, we are seeing a rise of open source related solutions starting to emerge. Many organizations are now offering KVM-based solutions which both avoid the increasing risks and expense associated with the legacy vendors to offer more accessible, flexible and cost-efficient VDI services. Changes in Microsoft virtualization access licensing in recent years helped open possibilities in the space, which has allowed for more efficient use of hardware and more bespoke options. There are industry specific services arising to serve architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), media production and other compute heavy sectors as well as more generalist, knowledge worker options for finance, law and similar businesses. As VDI offers the potential for higher levels of security, more efficient estate management and greater flexibility in our continuing challenging economic climate, this is to be welcomed. Innovation is critical for a healthy technical ecosystem and the ability to address specific industry requirements, whilst also continuing to focus on lowering carbon impacts and creating greater resilience. Businesses and channel operators should be open to such possibilities and actively engage with potential future partners to support development and mitigate the likelihood of monopolies and big tech dominance. We can see the overreach of some of these players in the news every day; supporting independent innovators is a proactive means of preventing an overgeneralization of power and its associated risks.

Title: How Are the ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Faring Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

To say it’s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff announcements.

By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher “reciprocal” tariffs for the U.S.’s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect—causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days—except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon’s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here’s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple’s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker’s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump’s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump’s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president’s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon’s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump’s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn’t completely reliant on e-commerce—its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company’s profits and won’t be as impacted by the administration’s levies as Amazon’s physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Title: Rocket Lab tapped for major defense contracts to advance hypersonic testing
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_tapped_for_major_defense_contracts_to_advance_hypersonic_testing_999.html

The U.S. Air Force has brought Rocket Lab onboard its $46 billion Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC), an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) arrangement intended to streamline access to innovative technologies and services. Structured for flexibility in funding and application, EWAAC runs through 2031 and enables rapid procurement of technical solutions across domains. Simultaneously, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence has included Rocket Lab in its Hypersonic Technologies and Capability Development Framework (HTCDF), a program valued at approximately $1.3 billion (\xa31 billion). Through this framework, Rocket Lab is now eligible to compete for contracts that will support the UK's pursuit of sovereign hypersonic technology. Rocket Lab plans to offer a suite of services under both frameworks, including use of its Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron (HASTE) vehicle. HASTE is a suborbital derivative of the Electron rocket and shares many core features, such as carbon composite construction and 3D-printed Rutherford engines. However, it includes a modified Kick Stage and is optimized for hypersonic test applications, with a payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Capable of delivering payloads at speeds exceeding 7.5 km per second, HASTE supports testing of high-speed air-breathing systems, gliders, ballistic vehicles, and reentry technologies. To date, Rocket Lab has completed three HASTE missions for the U.S. Department of Defense, including two launches within a span of just 21 days. These missions were conducted from Launch Complex 2 at Wallops Island, Virginia. Combined with its broader operations, Rocket Lab has launched over 200 payloads from its sites in the United States and New Zealand. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, remarked: "The ability to contribute toward the collective security of the United States and the United Kingdom across both of these important programs is a proud moment for the HASTE team, and a demonstration of Rocket Lab's commitment to lead from the front when it comes to innovative and unique solutions for hypersonic technology development. Keeping pace with global developments means more affordable tests at a higher rate that expands the boundaries of hypersonic technology - and that's a capability we're already providing all in one platform with HASTE, at a commercial price and cadence that serves the mission of both nations."

Hello! It's Tax Day in America. Wishing you all luck from afar — hopefully, you don't follow in my colleague Zak Jason's steps and forget to attach your W2. And today's big story is right on theme: We're taking a look at what's going on inside the IRS. What's on deck Markets: One crucial consequence of President Trump's trade war is being overlooked. Tech: Facebook isn't about connecting with friends anymore, Mark Zuckerberg said during day one of Meta's antitrust trial. Business: These automakers are picking up the slack from Tesla's slumping sales. But first, let's talk taxes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. How are you filing your taxes this year? You might be using IRS Direct File, the nation's first free tax-filing system. But its future is looking grim: A senior Treasury official told BI it was a failed and disappointing program used by only a small fraction of the nation's taxpayers. Sam Corcos, a DOGE official and one of the group's public faces, has also said he thinks the relatively new program should be shut down, sources told BI. The uncertainty has disappointed people who believe Direct File is emblematic of the very things that DOGE is supposed to be building, BI's Juliana Kaplan and Jack Newsham write. It's meant as a tech solution to file taxes quickly and directly to the IRS, bypassing fees to for-profit software companies. However, critics of the tool say it's too costly and wasn't implemented legally. Tax season is a source of angst for many Americans. This year, some IRS employees who have returned to the office are in the same boat. Workers under the IRS's return-to-office mandate said they've operated out of conference rooms and cafeterias, battled spotty internet connections, and navigated boxes of paperwork scattered throughout the halls. IRS employees told BI that while RTO had come with certain upsides, like leaving work at the office, the return has been tumultuous and the opposite of efficient. "People are not happy, and it's going to affect productivity going forward," one employee said. 1. An overlooked byproduct of Trump's trade: the weakest dollar in years. Typically seen as a safe haven during market volatility, the US dollar index is sitting near a three-year low. This may reflect souring global sentiment toward the US following unpredictable tariffs. 2. Webull's stock is soaring. The digital investment platform's shares spiked as much as 500% to $79.56 on Monday. Webull went public via SPAC merger after combining with SK Growth Opportunities and delaying its IPO plans in 2021. 3. Asia's auto stocks surge. Major automakers like Toyota and Honda saw significant stock gains on Tuesday after Trump said he was considering a temporary exemption on imports. 1. Apple can't catch a break right now. On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be off the hook on tariffs until President Trump clarified on Sunday that tech products would be subject to separate levies in the future. But Apple's China problem goes beyond tariffs. 2. Trump's trade war is putting robots to work. The robots-as-a-service company Formic said its customers have increased their robot usage this year. It's likely these brands were using robots to save money ahead of tariff-related price increases. 3. Facebook isn't really for friends, Mark Zuckerberg said. In a landmark antitrust case, the FTC is arguing that Meta monopolizes apps that share content with friends and family. Zuckerberg testified Facebook's main purpose has evolved beyond connecting with friends. 1. The biggest winners from Tesla's sales slump. The carmaker's competitors are taking bigger bites of Tesla's market share while the overall EV market grows. In the US, GM and Ford are some of the big winners, while BMW and VW are soaring in Europe. 2. Starbucks baristas' new fit. Starting May 12, Starbucks store employees will be required to wear a solid-color black top to highlight the iconic green apron. The dress code is the latest change the coffee chain has made as it tries to boost sales. 3. Pay us or give us a TV show. A Trump ally suggested Warner Bros. Discovery could please the president by offering money, programming, or both. That says a lot about the relationship between the president and the media in 2025, Peter Kafka writes.

Title: 'I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help' - how tech bros are taking over the world
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Im-from-the-technocracy-and-Im-here-to-help-how-tech-bros-are-taking-over-the-world
Time Published: 2025-04-15T07:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Kvakin - Fotolia When I first saw the photos of all of the tech broligarchy lined up behind Donald Trump on his inauguration day something struck me as off. I couldn't figure out what was bothering me until now. I realised they didn't just look like very powerful attendees, they looked much more like very powerful shareholders in government - and unelected ones at that. We can see today where that power translates directly into US government policymaking with the reductions on certain tech tariffs from China. Let's look at what that means for Apple alone. With 90% of iPhones manufactured in China, Apple faced potential price increases of up to $3,500 per phone under the proposed 145% tariff. In 2024, US imports of smartphones from China were valued at $41.7bn while laptops were valued at $33.1bn. The tariff exemption therefore translates into avoided costs of approximately $60bn annually for these two categories alone. And while Apple will have only a share of that benefit, it's a staggering return for Tim Cook's donation of $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee - which also marked Cook’s first time attending a presidential inauguration, despite his political views often differing from Trump’s policies. But it's not only tech’s influence in policymaking areas such as tariffs that directly affect their bottom line, we need to think about their broader reach in the realm of geopolitics. Where did the ideas of making Canada the 51st State, or annexing Greenland actually emerge from? If there was a policy vacuum here it was neatly filled by none other than Elon Musk drawing on the ideas of his maternal grandfather Joshua Norman Haldeman. Haldeman was a key proponent of the Technocracy movement which started in the early 1930s in the US and then spread to Canada. It proposed the creation of the Technate of America. This would do away with borders, merging the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America and Greenland into a single nation under a regime of engineers and technicians. Sounds familiar, right? Its essential argument was that there was no room for politics in society and that engineers and scientists were best placed to decide what was best for citizens in terms of organising resources and society. In 2019 Musk tweeted on X, “Accelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy”. Except now it looks like he is not waiting to do it on Mars, he's doing it here in real time. The idea of the futility of the nation state and of politics in favour of new technological frontiers is echoed in The sovereign individual published in 1997. This book examined the social, economic and political implications of the coming technology on society and particularly politics and governments. Authors James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg - father of Jacob Rees-Mogg - wrote, “Representative democracy as it is now known will fade away to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. The 20th century nation-state will starve to death as its tax revenues decline,” Or, as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, “Companies not countries”. The authors also predicted the impact of coming technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) when they wrote, “Lifetime employment will disappear as jobs increasingly become tasks or piece work rather than positions within an organisation. New survival strategies will evolve involving greater concentration on the development of leisure skills, sports abilities as well as providing services to the growing numbers of sovereign individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises.” The tome has had a substantial impact in Silicon Valley with Rees-Mogg travelling there more than a decade after the book's publication to discuss it with students at Stanford University. In 2014, PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel told Forbes magazine that The sovereign individual had influenced him more than any other book. Indeed, in recently republished versions of the book Thiel has provided a new foreword. And Thiel’s investments align with these principles where he believes that cryptocurrency ventures will bypass traditional monetary systems. Expect further policy reach in the future in the provision of universal basic income (UBI), which many of these tech bros are very keen on. They understand more than most how many professions are under threat and how many people will be left without work. What are people to do when their labour is no longer required? Perhaps they will spend their time in the fantasy worlds created by technologists, doomscrolling endlessly on Insta and other platforms while being paid by the government via UBI. This is what the author Jonathan Taplin tackles in his book The end of reality when he says “That is my greatest fear: that enchanted by the magic of the Technocrats’ immutable money, infinite frontiers, eternal life we will sleep through a right-wing revolution and wake up to find our democracy gone and our children being turned into Meta cyborgs”. And if you think having Trump as President of the United States with Elon Musk as his sidekick is a nightmare, ponder if you will the dystopian prospect of Mark Zuckerberg running for the highest office. Can you imagine the data he has amassed that could be used to further his political ambitions? What opponents might be suppressed or compromised? Yet as described in Sarah Wynn-Williams recent book Careless people, Zuckerberg has already paved the way for his political ambitions from as far back as 2017 when he finally realised how important Facebook was in the election of Donald Trump. In her insider account, Wynn-Williams wrote, “He also had Facebook’s board approve a new stock structure that would allow him to run for office. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly allows Mark Zuckerberg to leave Facebook for up to two years without losing control of the company if his absence is ‘in connection with his serving in a government position or office’.” These are not benign actors, scrappy startup founders who move fast and break things - they share world views that are destroying our democracies as we know it. Yet politicians are in thrall to the power that these men yield. We may already be existing in the new technocracy for our times. They already decide how and when we should use their products, removing our choice and agency – consider the recent inclusion of Meta AI into WhatsApp, which you cannot turn off. Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, “I'm from the government and I'm here to help.” So if you hear, “I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help,” you won't be surprised if it's our new form of government.

Title: Total Control 24 (TC24) Under Review: Best Prostate Health Supplement for Men in 2025

April 14, 2025 20:14 ET | Source: Total Control 24 (TC24) Total Control 24 (TC24) New York City, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1. Introduction: Prostate Health in Men Over 40 Prostate health is one of the most overlooked yet critical areas of concern for aging men. As men enter their 40s and beyond, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and lifestyle changes begin to impact the health of the prostate gland—a small but vital organ that supports urinary function and reproductive health. Recent studies reveal that nearly 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men in their 80s suffer from symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-associated enlargement of the prostate. These symptoms include: For many, these symptoms emerge gradually and are often dismissed as a regular part of aging. However, untreated BPH can significantly reduce quality of life. It disrupts sleep, causes anxiety in social settings, and contributes to chronic fatigue and low mood. Most men are unaware that the underlying triggers are often tied to an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), declining testosterone levels, and elevated oxidative stress that inflames the prostate tissue. These biological shifts reduce urinary flow efficiency, disrupt bladder function, and can impact overall male vitality. While prescription medications like alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are commonly used, they often come with unwanted side effects such as dizziness, low libido, or sexual dysfunction. That's why more men are turning to natural prostate supplements to regain control of their health—without harsh chemicals. This brings us to Total Control 24 (TC24), a revolutionary prostate support supplement that is being recognized as a top-rated formula for prostate health in men over 40. Designed to support normal prostate size, healthy urinary flow, and hormonal balance, TC24 combines clinically researched, bioavailable ingredients into a powerful daily solution. In this in-depth review, we will examine how Total Control 24 works, explore the top prostate health ingredients, evaluate the science behind its formula, compare it with other popular prostate supplements, and outline the pricing, return policy, and customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are seeking the best prostate health supplement that delivers results naturally, Total Control 24 deserves your attention. 2. Understanding the Problem: Why You're Experiencing Prostate Symptoms As men age, prostate-related discomfort becomes increasingly common—and it's not just about getting older. Several interconnected biological and environmental factors contribute to the gradual decline of prostate function. Understanding these causes is the first step toward lasting relief and better health. Hormonal Shifts and DHT Accumulation One of the primary drivers behind prostate enlargement is the hormonal imbalance that occurs with age. Testosterone levels begin to decline in a man's 40s, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—a more potent derivative of testosterone—often remains elevated. DHT can cause the cells in the prostate to multiply excessively, leading to an enlarged gland that puts pressure on the urethra. This creates frustrating urinary issues, including weak stream, urgency, and nighttime urination. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. In the prostate, this can lead to inflammation and cellular damage. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of BPH and may even contribute to more serious conditions if not addressed. Antioxidant-rich nutrients, like those found in TC24, help reduce this inflammation and protect the prostate against cellular breakdown. Lifestyle Factors That Exacerbate Symptoms In addition to biological changes, lifestyle habits also influence prostate health. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all worsen urinary symptoms and hormone imbalances. Additionally, high body fat can lead to increased estrogen production in men, further throwing off the delicate balance of male hormones. The Emotional Toll of Prostate Problems The daily struggle of dealing with frequent bathroom trips, poor sleep, or sexual dissatisfaction is more than a physical burden—it can affect self-confidence, work performance, and relationships. Many men report feeling embarrassed or isolated due to their symptoms, which in turn can lead to anxiety or even depression. Prostate issues are not just an inconvenience; they are an actual quality-of-life issue. The good news is that men do not have to live with these challenges. Addressing the root causes of prostate issues—hormonal imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress—can deliver lasting relief. This is precisely where Total Control 24 excels, providing a natural and comprehensive approach to restoring prostate health. Learn More About Total Control 24 Ingredients and How They Support Prostate Wellness 3. What is Total Control 24 (TC24)? Total Control 24 (TC24) is a next-generation prostate health supplement created by Adem Naturals. Designed specifically for men over 40 who are struggling with the signs of prostate enlargement and urinary discomfort, TC24 offers a multi-action formula targeting the key root causes of prostate decline. Rather than simply masking symptoms, TC24 works to support: This advanced supplement is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. TC24 uses a clean-label formula that is non-GMO, free of gluten and soy, and contains no artificial additives or fillers. Each capsule delivers a potent dose of herbal extracts, minerals, and antioxidants—all of which are selected for their ability to support long-term prostate health. Its formula includes several clinically backed ingredients such as Pygeum Africanum, Lipophytol®, Boron, and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which work synergistically to promote urinary comfort and hormonal harmony. What makes Total Control 24 unique is its strategic formulation: the combination of time-tested herbs and patented nutrients designed for bioavailability, precision dosing, and comprehensive coverage of prostate and urinary functions. Whether you're just starting to notice changes in your urinary habits or have been living with BPH-related discomfort for years, TC24 presents a compelling, natural solution worth considering. The Science Behind Total Control 24 Ingredients Myrciaria Jaboticaba (Jaboticaba) Myrciaria jaboticaba is a Brazilian superfruit known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is rich in polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which play a central role in modulating inflammation—a key contributor to prostate enlargement and discomfort. Recent research from the Federal University of Alfenas (2024) demonstrated that jaboticaba peel extract significantly reduces markers of oxidative stress and cellular inflammation. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the journal Food & Function found that its polyphenolic compounds protect DNA from oxidative damage, a critical factor in preventing cellular aging and potential mutation in prostate cells. Further evidence published in Food Chemistry (2025) and ScienceDirect highlights jaboticaba's role in reducing nitric oxide overproduction, which is often elevated in inflamed prostate tissue. This makes jaboticaba an essential component of natural prostate health formulas, helping maintain cellular integrity, reduce swelling, and support normal prostate function. Lipophytol® (Phytosterol Complex) Lipophytol® is a patented microencapsulated phytosterol complex that delivers enhanced bioavailability of beta-sitosterol and related plant sterols. These compounds are known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone closely associated with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies confirm that beta-sitosterol can improve urinary flow, reduce post-void residual volume, and alleviate symptoms like urgency and weak stream. Lipophytol®'s advanced encapsulation ensures better stability and absorption, allowing for more consistent and reliable results. As a DHT blocker and bladder support agent, Lipophytol® helps address hormonal imbalances and urinary discomfort, two common issues affecting men with aging prostates. Pygeum africanum (African Plum Tree Bark Extract) Pygeum africanum has been used for decades in European herbal medicine to treat prostate-related urinary symptoms. Its bioactive compounds—phytosterols, triterpenes, and ferulic acid esters—exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis and studies published in The American Journal of Medicine, Pygeum extract consistently reduces the frequency of nighttime urination, increases peak urine flow, and lowers the volume of residual urine. It also helps regulate hormonal activity within the prostate, contributing to symptom relief in men with enlarged prostates. With extensive clinical support, Pygeum provides multidimensional benefits, targeting inflammation, supporting hormone regulation, and improving quality of life through enhanced urinary function. Boron Boron is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in maintaining prostate health, particularly through its effects on hormone metabolism and inflammation. Research in Cancer Causes & Control (2007) and other peer-reviewed journals have shown that men with higher boron intake have a lower incidence of prostate cancer. Boron helps balance testosterone and estrogen levels, lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and enhances vitamin D metabolism—all of which are beneficial for prostate tissue maintenance. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating cytokines and reducing oxidative stress markers. In the context of Total Control 24, boron acts as a foundational mineral that enhances hormonal balance and supports prostate health at the cellular level, especially in aging men. Discover Why Total Control 24 Is One of the Best Prostate Supplements for Men Over 40 5. What Makes Total Control 24 the Best Prostate Health Supplement in 2025 With a saturated market full of over-the-counter remedies, herbal blends, and pharmaceutical options, choosing a prostate supplement can be overwhelming. What sets Total Control 24 (TC24) apart is its combination of ingredient quality, formulation integrity, clinical rationale, and consumer-focused transparency. These attributes collectively make TC24 one of the most advanced and trusted prostate support supplements currently available. Superior Ingredient Sourcing and Formulation TC24 stands out by leveraging patented, high-quality ingredients like Lipophytol® and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which are not found in generic prostate pills. These ingredients are selected based on rigorous scientific evidence supporting their roles in DHT regulation, inflammation reduction, and urinary support. Unlike many supplements that hide behind proprietary blends, TC24 offers transparency in its formulation. Additionally, the supplement is manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility in the USA, ensuring pharmaceutical-grade standards and consistent potency. The clean-label promise—no gluten, soy, artificial binders, or GMOs—further demonstrates the product's commitment to purity and safety. Multi-Pathway Mechanism of Action TC24 doesn't rely on a single mechanism. Instead, it addresses prostate health on multiple fronts: This multi-pronged strategy ensures that users experience relief from both acute symptoms (like frequent urination) and long-term risks (like unchecked prostate growth). Favorable Comparison to Leading Brands Compared to other high-profile prostate formulas such as Super Beta Prostate, ProstaGenix, and Prost-P10x, TC24 excels in ingredient diversity and synergy. While others rely heavily on saw palmetto alone, TC24 integrates a broad spectrum of targeted compounds that work together more effectively. It also offers more excellent value with precision dosing, clinical-grade ingredient selection, and better bioavailability via Lipophytol® delivery. Many competitors overlook absorption optimization, a crucial element when dealing with fat-soluble nutrients like phytosterols. Clean Label and Consumer Safety TC24 is designed for long-term use without dependency or dangerous interactions. Users can feel confident knowing they are taking a supplement that is: For aging men looking for a reliable, comprehensive, and well-formulated solution to support prostate health and urinary comfort, Total Control 24 delivers on every front. 6.

This section offers clear usage guidelines to help you get the most out of your investment in prostate health. Recommended Dosage Each bottle of Total Control 24 contains 60 capsules. The standard dosage is two capsules daily, taken preferably with a meal and a full glass of water. This allows for maximum nutrient absorption and ensures the active ingredients begin working effectively without causing stomach upset. Many users opt to take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening, which helps sustain consistent ingredient levels in the body throughout the day. When to Expect Results While some men may begin to notice improvements in urinary flow, frequency, and comfort within the first 7–10 days, optimal results typically become evident after 30–60 days of continuous use. This allows time for hormonal balancing, reduced inflammation, and cellular support to take hold. Results vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and the severity of prostate symptoms. However, most users report a steady and noticeable reduction in nighttime urination, urgency, and residual bladder sensation after one to two months. Can You Take It With Other Supplements or Medications? TC24 is made with natural, well-tolerated ingredients and is generally safe to take alongside other supplements. However, you are currently taking prescription medications for prostate issues, blood pressure, or hormone therapy. In that case, it is always best to consult your healthcare provider before adding any new supplement to your routine. Long-Term Use and Safety Total Control 24 is designed for ongoing use and does not create dependency or tolerance. In fact, many men choose to take TC24 as part of their long-term wellness plan to proactively maintain healthy prostate size, urinary comfort, and hormonal balance well into their 60s, 70s, and beyond. Because it is non-GMO, free from synthetic additives, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility, TC24 maintains high safety standards suitable for extended use. Tips for Best Results By following these guidelines, men can achieve sustained benefits from TC24 and take an active role in protecting and restoring their prostate health naturally. 8.
