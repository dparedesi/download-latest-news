ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions. AMZY allows investors to participate in these growth trends while receiving substantial monthly distributions, creating a compelling combination for those seeking both income and growth potential from a single investment. FBY focuses on Meta Platforms (META), delivering strong 2025 performance with a 16.1% year-to-date return alongside a 34.06% forward yield. Meta's transformation from a social media company to a "metaverse" and artificial intelligence leader has created significant stock volatility, particularly around quarterly earnings and major product announcements. This volatility provides excellent raw material for FBY's covered call strategy. Meta's substantial investments in virtual reality, augmented reality and AI infrastructure create ongoing uncertainty about future profitability timelines, leading to stock price fluctuations that benefit option strategies. The company's core advertising business remains highly profitable, providing fundamental support while newer initiatives drive volatility. FBY's $177 million in assets indicates solid investor interest in monetizing Meta's transformation story. The fund offers exposure to next-generation computing platforms while generating meaningful monthly income from one of technology's most ambitious companies. Meta's position in social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence ensures continued relevance in the global technology landscape. FBY presents an opportunity to participate in the potential metaverse revolution while collecting substantial distributions during the uncertain transition period. Bottom Line YieldMax ETFs offer income investors a unique approach to generating monthly distributions from growth stocks that traditionally don't pay dividends. The five funds highlighted—CONY, TSLY, NFLY, AMZY, and FBY—represent the most established and liquid options in this specialized category, each offering different risk-reward profiles through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies. While these funds can generate impressive yields ranging from 30% to over 120%, investors must understand that high income comes with trade-offs, including capped upside participation and significant volatility risk. For income-focused investors comfortable with these dynamics, YieldMax ETFs provide an innovative way to harvest yield from some of the market's most dynamic companies.

Title: The UN-backed climate investors’ group that invested in... fossil fuels

Despite having pledged to reach net-zero emissions, major members of Net Zero Asset Managers hold billions of dollars' worth of fossil-fuel stocks, including those in “carbon bomb” projects, while marketing their funds as green and sustainable. Select a language Fact check: In December 2020, a group of big players in international finance launched the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. They committed their firms to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. They planned to do this by directing investments toward sustainable businesses that are helping to cut the emissions responsible for the climate crisis. Context: Article 2c of the Paris Climate Agreement called for financial flows to be consistent with “a pathway towards greenhouse gas-emission-resilient development". Over 230 global banks and asset-management firms subsequently signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, launched in 2020 with the aim of “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier”. Alas, those firms’ investments tell a different story. Launched in 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative committed its members to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. Over 230 firms signed up to it, including European ones such as Germany's DWS, the Netherlands' Robeco, France's AXA, and Italy's Eurizon. Some of these we have covered in previous reporting due to their ostensibly “green” investments in the fossil-fuel industry. NZAM carried the institutional imprimatur of the United Nations, in the form of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. UN PRI signatories commit, among other objectives, to incorporating “ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes”. Specific ESG criteria are used to assess the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment. Net Zero Asset Managers has received significant media coverage, giving the impression that it is a force for change. In November 2022, for instance, the specialist magazine ESG Today headlined, “Net Zero Asset Managers reaches $66 trillion in assets under management”. The article explained that the signatories were committed to “progressively transforming their investment portfolios to align them with the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050". NZAM was covered on the UN's website in an April 2021 article titled “Biggest financial players back net zero”. NZAM's media profile has allowed its signatories to flaunt their commitment to the Paris climate accord and to market themselves as being mindful of sustainability. Yet our research shows that, at the high point of NZAM's activity in the last quarter of 2023, its members held the equivalent of $25 billion in fossil-fuel stocks in their “green” investment portfolios. Moreover, that sum included companies responsible for so-called “carbon bombs”, a term coined in 2022 by Kjell Kuhne, a campaigner at Leave it in the Ground (Lingo), to refer to hydrocarbons projects that generate more than one gigatonne of CO₂ over their lifetime. Specialists say that this type of project needs to be shuttered as quickly as possible if the Paris Agreement timetable is to be kept. Using data from the London Stock Exchange Data & Analytics, we identified funds classified as “green” under the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), in force since 2021. Articles 8 and 9 of the regulation govern the requirements to be met for marketing products as, respectively, having “environmental or social” objectives or being “sustainable investments”. The NZAM signatories that are most exposed to hydrocarbons accounted for 54 percent of all NZAM investments in this sector. They include DWS (a German firm), JP Morgan, BlackRock, Northern Trust and AllianceBernstein (all American), France's Amundi, the Netherlands' Robeco, Norway's Storebrand and Italy's Eurizon. Together they held a stake of just over $14 billion in the oil and gas industry. In 2023, many of these companies used terms such as “sustainability” and “innovation” to describe funds that held stakes in well-known oil giants. For example, the US firm State Street employed the words “Sustainable Climate” to market a fund that held a $7 million share in Exxon. Another fund, “Europe Climate Action”, marketed by Amundi, held $18 million of stakes in Aker, BP, Equinor, and TotalEnergies. In the past year, new guidelines have set clear limits on the use of sustainability-related words in the names of funds that invest in fossil fuels. However, as we showed in previous articles in this series, numerous asset managers continue to invest in dirty hydrocarbons while declaring their support for sustainability and ESG in their prospectuses to investors. Overall, of the ten NZAM members that have made the largest share of “green” investments, the stakes involved total $18 billion. They include 82 extraction projects defined as “carbon bombs” by Kjell Kuhne of Lingo. According to Kuhne, “the amount of emissions generated [by carbon bombs] is greater than that emitted in a year by the whole of Germany, a highly industrialized country that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels”. The investments made by the Net Zero Asset Managers have clearly not helped to convince their Big Oil beneficiaries to put a stop to these 82 “carbon bombs”. This despite the claim often made by asset managers that they can push the industry towards transition by means of their participation in company meetings and the votes they cast there. Furthermore, all ten firms mentioned are also signatories to the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment, despite continuing to invest in fossil fuels. In a report published in November 2024, the UN PRI Association writes that policymakers should instruct financial firms to implement “robust carbon pricing and market-based mechanisms, accelerating the full and equitable phase out of fossil-fuel subsidies and establishing clear plans and targets for phasing out unabated fossil fuels in line with credible 1.5°C pathways”. Kuhne, of Leave it in the Ground, is acerbic: ”These companies are actively creating these new CO2 bombs. When the climate is already in danger and spiraling out of control, not creating new carbon bombs should be the top priority." “A green investment should not provide any money to companies involved in the fossil-fuel supply chain“, he concludes. ”It should be ‘fossil-free’, and for me this is a fundamental criterion for being able to call oneself green, sustainable, and climate-friendly. Today, these companies are the biggest obstacle to progress towards sustainability. If you were selling a green fund while investing in Exxon, you were simply deceiving your customers."

Title: How Target let Walmart steal its rizz

Time Published: 2025-08-21T08:55:02Z

Phil Wahba is a senior writer at Fortune primarily focused on leadership coverage, with a prior focus on retail. Good morning. When Brian Cornell took the reins at Target 11 years ago, the retailer was, to put it mildly, a mess. Among its many problems: Target was struggling with out-of-stocks that frustrated shoppers, employee morale was low, and there was a sense that the retailer had lost much of the “Tar-zhay” cheap-chic magic that had won it millions of loyal, fanatical shoppers for decades. So it’s disappointing for fans to see that same shopping list of problems plaguing Target again. Sales have been in decline for three years now, and the stock has plunged 64% from its all-time high in 2022. It didn’t have to be this way. At the start of his tenure, Cornell, who the company announced yesterday will step down as CEO on February 1, was an outsider unafraid to move fast and break things. He had been CEO of a big PepsiCo unit, Michaels Stores, and Sam’s Club before that. As I detailed in a 2015 cover story, he quickly ended Target’s ill-advised Canada expansion to focus without distraction on a struggling U.S. business, assembled an A-team of merchants to re-energize Target’s store brands (for a while, Target was launching billion-dollar brands on a monthly basis) and changed Target’s insular culture. And in March 2017, in perhaps his boldest move, he announced a $7 billion multi-year program to remodel its physical stores, making them more inviting but also equipping them to support e-commerce pick up and delivery at a time investing in physical stores was seen as folly given Amazon’s ascendance. Wall Street pummeled the stock but Cornell had the last laugh. Target soared for years, building a huge digital business and taking market share from department stores. It was also well-positioned with its curbside pickup and improved grocery when the pandemic struck to be one of retail’s big winners alongside Walmart and Costco. Indeed, sales rose 20% in 2020 and the following year, revenue passed $100 billion for the first time. By that point, Cornell had been in the post for eight years, roughly the average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO. But rather than hand on the baton, he signed on for another three years through 2025. Unfortunately, inertia set in. Shoppers felt Target lost its edge. Millions defected. Meanwhile, Walmart swooped in to take market share with its suddenly hipper apparel and home goods offerings. (The whole contretemps around DEI was also an unforced error that hurt morale.) Cornell had a great run overall, but like many CEOs, seems to have misjudged the moment when it’s time to move on. (And he’s not really going away—he will stay on as executive chairman indefinitely.) Though Wall Street had been hoping for an outsider to take the reins, Target’s COO Michael Fiddelke got the nod. He’ll have his work cut out for him. But perhaps the lesson here is, even successful CEOs have a shelf life.—Phil Wahba The Fed is more concerned about inflation than jobs U.S. Federal Reserve officials were more concerned about the inflationary impact of President Trump’s trade tariffs than signs of weakness in the job market, according to the minutes of their last meeting. The Fed meets at Jackson Hole today. Chair Jerome Powell will make a closely watched speech on Friday. Fed governor accused of mortgage fraud Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was accused of mortgage fraud and referred for criminal prosecution by federal housing regulator Bill Pulte. He said she "has falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statutes." Cook is accused of taking out loans on properties in Michigan and Atlanta and claiming that both were her principal residence. Trump called on her to resign. Context: The Trump administration is trying to end the Fed’s economic independence and bring it under political control. Powell has also been referred for a criminal probe, baselessly, over his remarks to Congress. Meta reorganizes its “superintelligence” unit Meta is doubling down on its so-called race to “superintelligence,” reshuffling its AI organization once more as its new Meta Superintelligence Labs group takes shape. But analysts say investors are keeping their eye on the prize Meta has always promised: improved products that increase engagement and, in turn, sell more ads. Superintelligent AI models, if they arrive, are just a means to that end. Former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang is leading the reorganization. China moved against Nvidia after “insulting” remarks from Lutnick Regulators in China moved to restrict companies from buying Nvidia chips after they felt insulted by remarks on CNBC by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the FT reports. “We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,” Lutnick said on July 15. “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking.” Bed Bath & Beyond blasts California Bed Bath & Beyond won’t open stores in California because the state “has created one of the most overregulated, expensive and risky environments for businesses in America,” executive chairman Marcus Lemonis said in a statement. The chain went bankrupt in 2023 and closed all its stores, but is attempting a comeback under Kirkland’s Inc. It has opened a new store in Nashville. California officials were unfazed by Lemonis’s criticism. “Like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath & Beyond no longer existed,” the governor’s spokesperson said. The tide shifts in the labor market Managers offered up significant raises to keep employees around during the Great Resignation in the aftermath of the pandemic. Now they’re taking the power back with return-to-office policies and pay cuts. ‘Bubble’ worries hit Big Tech stocks Big Tech stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid concerns of a potential AI bubble after a new MIT report found that nearly 95% of corporate generative AI pilot programs had “little to no” profit or revenue upside. Experts who spoke to Fortune, however, say this correction is expected and not necessarily indicative of a bubble. Sony raises console prices due to tariffs Sony announced that it will raise the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles to adjust for the Trump Administration's tariffs on electronics made in China. The company joins Microsoft and Nintendo, which have made similar price increases on their consoles this year. We’re not going to see those Epstein docs A federal court has ruled for a second time that transcripts and exhibits from the grand jury probe of Jeffrey Epstein will not be released because there are not "any special circumstances" to justify the move. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket, after the index closed down 0.24% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.1% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading.

Title: Baidu’s Sales Slide Most Since 2022 in Fierce Chinese AI Contest

(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc.’s quarterly revenue fell its most in about three years, hurt by an economic downturn that’s capping its ability to fight bigger rivals in AI and make inroads in newer areas. The Ernie chatbot creator’s sales in the June quarter fell 4% to 32.7 billion yuan ($4.6 billion), weighed down by a slowdown in its core internet search operations. Net income rose 33%, versus projections for a decline, helped by a boost from long-term investments. The company’s US shares slid 2% in pre-market US trading. China’s internet search leader is betting big on generative AI to drive future growth, but it faces mounting pressure from open-sourced models like DeepSeek as well as a wave of AI-native apps encroaching on its turf. The company will continue to invest in artificial intelligence even as margins and revenue come under pressure in the near term, Chief Financial Officer Henry He said. That’s while its mainstay search business loses ground to social-video platforms like Xiaohongshu and TikTok’s Chinese twin Douyin. Online advertising revenue declined 15%. But non-marketing revenue grew a better-than-expected 34%, aided by demand for its cloud unit. “Since the AI search monetization is still in very early stages and has yet to scale, our revenue and margins are under considerable pressure in the near-term with Q3 expected to be especially challenging,” He said. “We see potential for margin improvement as our core advertising business recovers and stabilizes.” Baidu ADRs Dip as Results Show Revenue Drop: Street Wrap Baidu is counting on Ernie to underpin an AI ecosystem and drive demand for its cloud division, whose sales have grown by double-digits in recent quarters. It’s also accelerating an overseas push by its Apollo Go robotaxi service, through partnerships with Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. Baidu’s driverless rides in the June quarter more than doubled to 2.2 million, with cumulative rides passing 14 million in August, it said. Baidu plans to take its fleet of self-driving robotaxis — common in Beijing, Guangzhou and Wuhan — to Singapore and Malaysia as early as this year, Bloomberg reported. The company is now running trials in Hong Kong. But in China’s increasingly crowded AI arena, Baidu faces rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. — both with far more firepower and larger global footprints — as well as nimble upstarts. Baidu’s stock price is up around 6% this year, trailing both of the bigger internet leaders. “We are not yet at the stage for large-scale monetization,” co-founder Robin Li told analysts on a call. “While our AI transformation is progressing rapidly, it is still in the early stages, with considerable room for optimization before reaching its full potential.” Baidu’s Ernie was one of the first chatbots to launch in the world’s biggest internet arena, but it’s since lost ground to apps from ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent as well as open-sourced models like Alibaba’s Qwen. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Baidu’s modest 2Q core top-line beat on rising AI cloud services demand came despite search engine ads falling 15% to 16.2 billion yuan, while adjusted operating income plunged 41% to 4.4 billion yuan. Margins were also pressured with gross margin missing forecasts by 120 bps, falling 780 bps annually to 43.9%, as the revenue mix shifted toward lower-margin cloud services. - Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu, senior analyst Click here for the research. The company has had to abandon its paid subscription model as well as open-source its proprietary Ernie models. That’s as Baidu’s Netflix-style subsidiary iQiyi Inc. reported an 11% revenue drop. The embattled streaming platform is seeking to raise $300 million for a listing in Hong Kong this year, Bloomberg News has reported. --With assistance from Vlad Savov.

Title: Private Equity In Your 401(k)? What Trump’s Order Opens—And Doesn’t
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/08/21/private-equity-in-your-401k-what-trumps-order-opens-and-doesnt/

ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” directing the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore ways to include private market investments and crypto in retirement plans. The order argues that American workers should have access to the same alternative investment opportunities long available to institutions and the wealthy. What what does this all mean for holding private equity in your 401(k)? With its bold framing, the order has already prompted some regulatory policy shifts. The SEC was asked to revisit accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules that currently limit retail participation. And indeed, earlier this week, the SEC issued guidance in ADI 2025-16 ending the 15% private investment limit in registered closed-end funds and related practices in place since 2002. The DOL, meanwhile, must reconsider past guidance on fiduciary duties under ERISA, including whether to establish safe harbors for fiduciaries who add private assets to 401(k) menus. The private equity (PE) industry has been preparing for this opening. With more than $12 trillion in defined-contribution retirement accounts, the 401(k) market is an enormous opportunity. And Trump’s executive order comes at a moment when private capital firms face a liquidity crunch: since 2018, capital calls have outpaced distributions by $1.5 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley. That imbalance is pushing managers to look toward retail dollars. Still, access is not the same as advantage. Ludovic Phalippou, professor at Oxford’s Said Business School, warns that private equity’s favored performance metric—the internal rate of return (IRR)—is a “mathematical artifact” that flatters results. If IRR claims were taken literally, he notes, modest 1970s funds would today be worth trillions—numbers that defy reality. Even when presented cleanly, PE performance may be more incremental than transformational. Of course, the time period of observation is key. Hamilton Lane, a leading private markets investor, calculates that $1 invested in private equity over the past decade would now be worth $3.96. That solid return edges out the S&P 500 ($3.51). Yet the gains come with trade-offs—illiquidity, opaque valuations, and higher fees—that can matter more to individuals than to large institutions. Diversification claims also deserve a second look. Private equity is still equity. While PE managers stress operational improvements and active ownership, today’s higher interest rates and thinner IPO pipelines expose the limits of the model. The easy returns of the 2010s may not repeat. Another hurdle lies in fiduciary duty. ERISA requires plan sponsors to act solely in the interests of participants, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits if high-fee, illiquid assets are added without clear justification. This litigation risk has kept most fiduciaries away from alternatives. As the Financial Times reported, firms like Apollo and BlackRock lobbied aggressively for the order, but ultimately the DOL—and the courts—will decide whether these products can withstand scrutiny. So the question lingers: will PE firms offer some of their best opportunities to retail investors—or their leftovers? Some skepticism is warranted, but there are already signs of good faith. Take KKR. The firm recently renegotiated terms with some institutional investors, increasing the carve-out share from the traditional 7.5% to as much as 20%. The change helps KKR deploy the increasing amounts of cash they are raising from individuals in perpetual vehicles. While controversial, the shift shows a willingness to integrate retail investors on a more equity footing. Even with such examples, executive action alone won’t deliver democratization. Regulators must craft rules that are protective yet practical--safe harbors for fiduciaries, updated investor eligibility standards, and far greater transparency on fees and liquidity. Private equity now faces a crossroads. It can broaden access responsibly, building trust with retail investors, or reinforce perceptions that it serves others first. For 401(k) plan sponsors and participants, the prudent course is cautious engagement—welcoming innovation in expansion of access to private markets while maintaining investor protections through disclosure and oversight. Access, after all, is not alignment. Done thoughtfully, private equity investment in 401(k)s provides broader investment solutions for retirement savers. Done poorly, it risks harming individuals and eroding confidence in the retirement system itself.

In This Show: “I would love to get a rundown on the financial details in a stock quote. I agree with your preachings against picking and owning individual stocks, whoever chump's going to chump. And one of those chumps is my wife who recently enthusiastically brought me the quote on her latest stock interest. The reason she was so excited was that the price per share was $5, which she considers a steal. I tried to explain that the price per share is meaningless without considering the underlying value per share, but she wasn't having it. Just like with free handbags, she believes that the price is the value. That got me thinking that a rundown on the significance of price per share may be beneficial.” Publicly owned companies exist because, at some point, the original owners wanted to trade ownership for cash. Instead of selling the business to one buyer, which can be difficult for very large or valuable companies, they sell shares to the public through a process called going public. Once a company is listed on the stock market, the value of the company is determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the price per share. That number is called the market capitalization. For example, Tesla’s market cap has been close to a trillion dollars, making it a large-cap company. The stock price itself moves constantly as investors reassess what they think the company is worth, sometimes changing by several percentage points in a single day. Looking more closely at Tesla, you can see how this plays out in real time. The share price can swing dramatically in a year, from a peak of $428 down to around $308, a drop of over 25%. Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio is especially high at around 179, which means investors are paying $179 for each dollar of earnings. This only makes sense if investors believe the company’s profits will grow much faster than average. The lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio are more important than the stock price itself. A $5 stock is not inherently cheaper than a $100 stock, because the number of shares can be adjusted through stock splits, and the underlying value of the company remains unchanged. The same principles apply to funds and ETFs. For instance, VTI, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, may trade at a price per share similar to Tesla, but its true scale comes from the total assets it manages—which are nearly $2 trillion. Online charts provide a quick snapshot of performance, but deeper analysis often requires resources like Morningstar, where you can examine holdings, turnover, and valuation details. For VTI, about 32% of the fund is concentrated in the top 10 companies like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, which shows how heavily weighted the US market is toward a few large growth firms. Over time, the balance between large growth and small value stocks tends to shift, and many investors expect that pendulum to eventually swing again. Ultimately, the main point is that stock prices alone are meaningless. What matters are valuations, fundamentals, and the overall structure of the investments you hold. More information here: A Die-Hard White Coat Investor Buys an Individual Stock — An M&M Conference Picking Individual Stocks Is a Loser’s Game “Hey Jim, it's Ricardo in South Florida. I have a question about investing in bonds. I am in agreement with the three-fund portfolio investment philosophy. With that in mind, I already have VTI and VXUS in my investment portfolio. And I've never actually had bonds before. I want to introduce them. I was wondering how I should do this. Some background, I am 50 years old, primary care internal medicine doctor. I have a small amount of student loans—about $30,000 at 2.75%—and a mortgage about $200,000 for my home at 2.75% also. I don't have a lot of space in my tax-protected account because I've been doing the Backdoor Roth IRAs and I don't have a traditional IRA. My question is, since I need to invest in taxable accounts in my brokerage account at Vanguard, how should I go about doing this? I am in agreement with your recommendations to do 50% in tax-protected bonds and 50% in inflation-protected bonds. The question is which bond ETF or mutual funds should I choose for my taxable brokerage account at Vanguard? Like I said, I do live in Florida, so I don't have state taxes. But I do want to avoid federal income taxes.” The three-fund portfolio is a simple and popular investing approach that combines a total US stock market index, a total international stock market index, and a total bond market index. The idea is to keep things straightforward while still achieving broad diversification across stocks and bonds. It is easy to implement in almost any type of account—from 401(k)s to HSAs—and the funds are widely available at very low cost from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. This portfolio appeals to many because it is cheap and diversified, and it requires little maintenance. The key to success, however, is not picking the perfect portfolio but choosing a reasonable one, funding it consistently, and sticking with it for the long run. When thinking about asset location, tax efficiency becomes important. Bonds are generally less tax-efficient than stocks because their returns are taxed as ordinary income every year. That is why many investors try to keep their bond holdings in tax-protected accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. If you need to place something in taxable accounts, US total stock market funds are often the best choice. They are relatively tax-efficient, with low yields and a high percentage of qualified dividends, which means less of the return is taxed each year and at lower rates. In fact, more than 95% of dividends from the total stock market fund are typically qualified. For those with very large taxable accounts or limited room in tax-protected accounts, sometimes bonds must be held in taxable accounts. In that case, municipal bonds can be a smart choice, particularly for high-income investors. The interest from municipal bonds is exempt from federal taxes, and if you buy bonds specific to your state, they may also be free from state taxes. In states with no income tax, like Florida, a general municipal bond fund works well. Investors who want inflation protection may also consider adding Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), though these are best held in tax-protected accounts due to their complex tax treatment. Ultimately, the three-fund portfolio works well for many, but it can be adjusted with municipal bonds or TIPS to better fit an investor’s tax situation and income level. The important lesson is to focus less on finding the one perfect portfolio and more on choosing something reasonable, keeping costs low, and staying disciplined over time. More information here: Investing in Bonds – Back to Basics In Defense of Bonds “Hello, Jim, this is Ash from Virginia. I was speaking with my financial advisor recently, and he recommended that I invest in private equity as a way to diversify and reduce market correlation. Otherwise, I am heavily invested in Vanguard index funds. I was wondering if you thought this was a good idea, neutral, or a bad idea. “ Private equity is a very broad term that simply refers to any business that is not publicly traded on the stock market. That could mean everything from a local, small business to large private corporations or real estate held on the equity side rather than the debt side. While the phrase often gets used as if it refers to a specific sophisticated investment type, it really encompasses a wide range of possibilities. The key difference between private and public markets is that public markets offer liquidity, transparency, and daily pricing, while private markets can avoid those pressures but lack the same ease of access and regulation. Even public companies sometimes go private to escape the demands of constant market scrutiny. Private equity can be structured in many ways, including funds that buy businesses using leverage with the intent to resell them later at a profit. However, this approach often leads to aggressive cost-cutting that harms operations, as seen in some physician groups and hospitals where services decline while profits are extracted. Investors considering private equity need to understand these tradeoffs. Unlike public investments, private equity lacks liquidity, meaning money may be tied up for years, and outcomes can vary widely depending on management and strategy. At the same time, there is growing interest in private equity from major players like Vanguard, which has partnered with BlackRock to explore offering these opportunities more broadly. The promise is that private equity could enhance returns or provide diversification, though whether that proves true remains to be seen. Investors should approach private markets carefully. Legally, many private equity investments are limited to accredited investors, which by rule means earning at least $200,000 annually or having $1 million in investable assets. Yet beyond those benchmarks, the real requirement should be the ability to evaluate the investment independently and the financial strength to withstand a complete loss without serious consequences. Even for those who qualify, diversification remains essential. Only a portion of a portfolio should be illiquid, and every investment should be weighed on its own merits. Investing success comes from building a reasonable, diversified portfolio and sticking with it over time, not chasing every new opportunity. Private equity may or may not deserve a place in your portfolio, but it is not essential for financial success. Staying disciplined, balancing fear of missing out against the risks of loss, and keeping long-term goals in focus are what ultimately lead to financial security.

He is a great example of the power of getting your finances in line and how that allows you to create the life you want. Finance 101: Sequence of Returns Risk Sequence of returns risk, or SORR, is the danger that retirees can run out of money even if their portfolio earns strong average returns over time. The problem arises when poor investment returns occur early in retirement while withdrawals are high. When account balances are shrinking and withdrawals continue, the portfolio becomes more vulnerable to being depleted. This issue is especially concerning for those entering retirement during an economic downturn, a prolonged recession, or a period of high inflation, making it an important risk to plan for in a financial strategy. There are several ways to reduce this risk. Retiring with a large portfolio relative to expenses is one solution because a low withdrawal rate of 1%-3% makes portfolios very resilient. Others can choose to work longer, which both shortens the retirement horizon and reduces dependence on early withdrawals. Delaying Social Security benefits and using guaranteed income sources, such as pensions or annuities, also provide stability, ensuring essential expenses are covered regardless of market performance. These strategies can dramatically reduce the impact of poor early returns. Portfolio design also plays a key role in managing sequence of returns risk. Investors can prepare by holding assets that protect against inflation, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), real estate, and equities. Many retirees also adopt strategies like maintaining a “bond tent” with more bonds in the years around retirement or creating a TIPS ladder to fund the first several years of spending. Others rely on the bucket approach, keeping some cash for short-term needs and replenishing it only during good market years. Flexible withdrawal methods, such as guardrail strategies, allow spending to adjust depending on returns, though in bad markets spending may need to be cut significantly. A thoughtful plan that considers these tools can help retirees avoid running out of money even when early returns are unfavorable.

All right, welcome back to the podcast. It's summer. That means we're all trying to take time off around here at White Coat Investor. It's amazing to look at the weeks and see how many of our staff are gone in any given week. But that means when we're together, we wedge everything in and try to get the work done. Unfortunately, that's the way emergency medicine works too. And I've apparently taken too much time off in this month. And so, here I find myself this week working seven days straight. Now, it's not unusual for docs. I know docs do that all the time, but for me, it's a little unusual. I only work six shifts a month and I've got five of them this week between shifts for July at the end of July and shifts for August at the beginning of August. You can tell I'm recording this on the last day of July. And then, of course, the other two days in the week are chock full of WCI stuff. So I'm feeling a little crispy right now, not going to lie, but I'm going to spend all next week backpacking. So, should be okay. Looking forward to going to the Uinta Mountains with some young men from our church group. So it should be a lot of fun. RUNDOWN ON FINANCIAL DETAILS OF A STOCK QUOTE All right, let's get into your questions today. We've got a lot of great questions to talk about today. The first one comes in from somebody who sent me an email. Said, “I have a suggestion for a blog post.” And I said, sounds better to cover on the podcast. Said, “A rundown on the financial details in a stock quote. I agree with your preachings against picking and owning individual stocks, whoever chumps going to chump. And one of those chumps is my wife who recently enthusiastically brought me the quote on her latest stock interest. The reason she was so excited was that the price per share was $5, which she considers a steal. I tried to explain that the price per share is meaningless without considering the underlying value per share, but she wasn't having it. Just like with free handbags, she believes that the price is the value. That got me thinking that a rundown on the stock fund, ETF, et cetera, quote items, especially the significance of price per share may be beneficial.” Okay. Well, let's talk about this. First of all, the reason there are publicly owned companies is that once people owned a company and decided they didn't want to own it anymore, they would rather have cash than own the company. So they sold it. Sometimes you feel like you can get a better price by selling it to everybody than by selling it to just one person or one company. And especially if it's a particularly valuable company, you can't find any one person to buy it. You have to go sell it to everybody. And that's called going public. That's when a stock becomes a stock, when it gets on the stock market. It goes from being a public company or a private company to being a publicly traded company. And in order to do that, you have to try to figure out about what the company's worth. And then once it starts trading on the stock market, everybody, the market gets to decide what the company's worth. And that changes by the second during the day. That's why the price of your stock goes up by 1% or down by 7% in a single day, because the market changes their opinion. As things go along, the market is all of us weighing in on what the opinion is. The way you determine the value of a publicly traded company though, is you count up the number of shares and you multiply that number of shares by the price per share. That's not that hard to do. Basically that information is available for any publicly traded company. So, if we put in Tesla stock into Google, what pops up is Tesla Inc. It says it's traded on the NASDAQ, gives you the ticker TSLA, and tells you what the market cap of the company is. And according to this, it is $967 billion. $967 billion is a market capitalization. That's how much the company is worth. The value of the company at this second is $967 billion, almost a trillion dollars. That makes it a big company. This is a large cap company. There are mid cap companies and there are small cap companies. But when you're worth a trillion dollars, you're considered a large cap company. But if you look at the information available on that, you can see all kinds of things. The most interesting thing that we look at most often is probably the stupid chart that pops up. And you can change that chart. It'll show you how the price has varied over the last day. As I record this, it looks like Tesla's down today. It's gone down from 09:00 A.M. It was $320 a share, and now it's $308 a share. If we lengthen that out and look at the year to date number, we see that Tesla was not an awesome thing to own this year. It peaked in January at $428 a share. And again, today it's $308 a share. So, it's down like over 25%, 26%, 27% this year. Now you understand why I don't talk about politics so much on this podcast. When the CEO of Tesla gets involved in politics, his company becomes worth a lot less. Lesson learned there, I suppose. This also tells you the high and low prices for this stock during the day. It's been anywhere from $306 a share to $321 a share. It will tell you the price to earnings ratio, the PE ratio, basically how much you're paying per dollar of earnings. And it's pretty ridiculous for Tesla. According to this, it's $179 for a dollar of earnings. The PE ratio is 179. Pretty impressive that people would be willing to pay that much for this company. Basically what that says, when you're willing to pay that much for a dollar of earnings, you're saying, I think the earnings are going to grow, and I think they're going to grow faster than the typical company. That's why you're willing to pay 40 or 50 or 100 or 200 times earnings, because you think the earnings are going to grow. Okay, that tells you lots of things about it. But as the emailer notes, the price of the stock doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if there are 10 million shares of the stock and it's worth $100 a share, or if there are 5 million shares of the stock and it's worth $200 a share. It doesn't matter. The company's worth the same. A stock that is $5 is not cheaper than a stock that is $10. It doesn't matter if you buy two shares of the $5 one or one share of the $10 one. Same, same. The way we look at what's cheap are valuation type things, like a price to earnings ratio, a PE ratio, or a price to book ratio. These sorts of things are how you tell which stocks are cheaper, which stocks are more expensive. And sometimes it's okay to buy a more expensive stock. Sometimes it's worth more, but you don't judge that by the share price. You judge that by the PE ratio. The share price is irrelevant. I guess if you're so poor that you can only buy one share of stock and Tesla's $308 and you don't have $308, so you got to buy something else. Well, I guess that's a concern. But for most of us, you can buy any stock you want. That's not going to be a problem. You're going to be buying multiple shares of those stocks if you're buying stocks. So the share price is really pretty much irrelevant. Don't get too hung up on that. All right, if we put in a mutual fund or an ETF, let's put in VTI. This is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF share class. This is a big piece of our portfolio, about 25% of our portfolio is invested in this or something very similar to it we tax loss harvest to. You can see that the share price is $310, about the same as the price of Tesla stocks. So, it asks if that is worth more or less. Now, this is interesting. I look at the market cap on this and it says 254 billion. I'm not sure that's right. Maybe that's right just for the ETF share class. But if I go to Vanguard's site, I'm pretty sure there's a lot more money in the Total Stock Market Index Fund than just a quarter trillion dollars. Let's see what the actual website says here. Portfolio composition, number of stocks, median market cap of those stocks, the earnings growth rate, and maybe that's what they're reporting. Maybe what this fund is reporting is the median market cap for those rather than how much is actually in the fund. The fund's net assets as of the end of June was $1.9 trillion. So that's not what the ticker is reporting when you put that into Google. It must be the median market cap that it's recording. The median market cap of the stocks in the fund or the average market cap, I'm not sure it's even the median. Lots of interesting information there. But mainly when you're looking at these things online to click on this stuff, you're just looking for a quick read on what is done this year or today or this month or whatever, rather than looking for detailed information. If you want detailed information, I think one of the best places to go is the Morningstar website. All the time I'll type in VTI and Morningstar. If you wanted to learn about Tesla stock, you'd put in Tesla and Morningstar. And that'll give you all kinds of fun detailed information there. Tells you the previous closed price, what it closed at yesterday when the market closed. Tells you the 52-week range of what it's traded between. Apparently it's been as low as $182 a share and as high as $488 a share over the last year. It tells you the bid and the ask price. Because this is a market. The bid price is what people are offering to buy your shares. The ask price is what people are asking if you want to buy shares. And there's a slight difference between them. With a very liquid security like Tesla stock or like VTI ETF, those prices are very close together. But the difference between them is what the market maker gets paid. Because somebody's got to hold onto that thing to take it from the buyer and give it to the seller or take it from the buyer. And that's what they make is the difference between the bid and the ask. And right now that's 4 cents on a share of Tesla. But that really adds up if you're doing it by the millions and millions of shares of stock that are exchanged every day. For Tesla, it says here there's 3.2 billion shares outstanding. The market cap is just under a trillion. It tells you how many shares trade every day. 85 million. That's a lot of shares it's trading around. Of the 323 billion, 85 million of them trade every day. This says the price earnings is $154. Price per sales ratio is 12. It gives you all kinds of information about the stock. And if you do the same thing, if you put in VTI Morningstar, it'll give you all kinds of information about funds and about ETFs. And you can click on a different tab and look at the performance. You can see what's in the portfolio and really figure out what's in there. It'll tell you where the stocks are. Of course, with VTI, they're all in the US. It'll tell you how many there are. There's 3,547 holdings in the fund. 32% of the fund is in the top 10 holdings. Their turnover is 2% per year, which is what you'd expect when they just buy and hold everything. You wouldn't expect a lot turnover there. The biggest stock right now is Microsoft, actually. Microsoft is the biggest stock in the stock market at 6%, 6.19%. NVIDIA is next at 6.13%. Apple is next at 5.13%. And apparently 32% of the US stock market is in the top 10 holdings. That's historically relatively high. It's pretty concentrated at the top. That's because large growth has outperformed small value stocks dramatically over the last 15 years. And in fact, the gap in valuations between those two types of stocks has not been as large as it is now. I don't know if it has ever been as large as it is now. That doesn't tell you that small value is going to outperform anytime soon, but you got to think the pendulum is probably going to swing back at some point. It didn't this year. The international, the US pendulum swung back this year, but the small value to large growth one did not. All right. I think that's enough talk about that subject. But yeah, the stock price doesn't matter. That's not what makes something cheap. It's not a good deal because it's $5 and another stock might be $80. That really doesn't matter. The stock price really doesn't matter at all. In fact, when it becomes inconvenient, they just split the stock. And so, instead of having whatever, 10 million shares at $500, they've now got 20 million shares at $250. And everyone rejoices and bids up the stock because it's split. It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter at all. TRACKING RETURNS Okay. Joe wants to talk about tracking the returns on his portfolio. Let's take a listen. Joe: Hey, Jim, I have a question for you about return tracking and specifically what return you use for your comparators in order to provide a benchmark for your stock portfolio. I do keep an individual stock portfolio as a small portion of my allocation, and I track these dollar-weighted returns, which have actually been quite good in the range of 24% to 25% since 2012. However, I acknowledge that as stocks get what I feel overvalued, I tend to move out of individual stocks in favor of broadly diversified ETFs to try to minimize my individual stock risk as values change. I have been out of the market in terms of individual stocks during some larger downturns, for example, during COVID and during 2022. As such, I'm trying to decide how to best compare my individual stock returns in a dollar-weighted approach, but I find that it's actually quite challenging to do a true dollar weighted adjustment based on when my money flows in and out of individual stocks. I do use VTI as my comparator as I'm trying to base myself against a large cap index, but not sure whether I should be using a dollar weight or a time-weighted tracking return. Thanks. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, let's talk about stock picking, Joe. Long-term White Coat Investors know I'm not a huge fan of stock picking or timing the market, both of which you're doing. You tell me you've been doing this for a long time though, 12 years, something like that, more? I don't remember what year you just said it was that you started, but it's been a long time. And you're telling me you're making 24 or 25%. I assume that's true, that you can actually accurately calculate a return. I'm not 100% sure of that because that's what your question is, is how to actually do this. But if it's true, if you're really making 24 or 25% a year because you're particularly talented and skilled at timing the market and picking stocks, I'm not sure you should just be managing your own money, Joe. There are a lot of people out there trying to do this and not having much success at it. They're certainly not whooping the market by 10% or 15% a year. So if you can truly do this, if you're truly one of those very talented people out there, you should be managing billions of dollars, not your own measly $100,000 or $2 million or however much money you have. So, keep that in mind. If you want to be a stock picker, track your returns, track them rigorously. And if it turns out you're really good at this, maybe you missed your calling. Maybe you shouldn't be in medicine or law or whatever has caused you to listen to the White Coat Investor podcast. Maybe you should be out there managing money. It is no small feat to have those sorts of returns long-term. Let's talk a little bit about how to track your returns. And I find the easiest, most accurate way to do this, maybe it's not the easiest, but it is the most accurate, is to use a spreadsheet. If you use a spreadsheet, whether it's Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you use a function called XIRR. It gives you the internal rate of return of the investment. This is a dollar-weighted return. It's not a time-weighted return. Morningstar will put out these studies every now and then saying that investors in general underperform their funds. They give you the fund's time-weighted return. That's what funds report. And they give you the investor's dollar-weighted return because that's the return that investors get. And because investors chase performance, the dollar-weighted return tends to lag the time-weighted return by several percentage points. You also see that because the market generally goes up over time and investors are, of course, putting money in as time goes along. If some of your money went in in April and some of it went in in October and some of it went in in November this year to that investment, of course, you're going to underperform it if it went up over the whole year. Because the time-weighted return assumes you have the same amount of money in there the whole year and you actually didn't. If you're tracking your own returns, I think you ought to use the dollar-weighted return. And that's what XIRR gives you. You can practice this. And there's a blog post on the website about it. If you Google XIRR or calculate your return on the White Coat Investor website, it will walk you through this process and show you how to do it. But basically there's one column of dates and you have to use the date function. You can't just type in the date. You have to use the date function in the spreadsheet. And then the other column is your cash flows. If you're putting money into the portfolio, it's negative. If you take money out of the portfolio, it's positive. And then you have your starting values, a negative number at the top, your ending values, a positive number for whatever it's worth right now at the bottom, and it gives you the return. That's an annualized return. If you're doing this for a period of time less than a year, it's going to annualize it out. If you made 8% this year and you're only halfway through the year, it's going to tell you 16%. And over a multi-year period, it's going to annualize it, as well. If you tell them it's an eight-year period and it gives you a number, that's going to be a return per year that you're getting. That's what the IRR is, is it's an annualized number, which is the one that matters. That's the way you track your return. Now, if you're trying to figure out how you're doing with your stock portfolio, with your stock picking prowess, all you have to keep track of is when the money goes into the account and when money comes out of the account. You don't have to track every individual stock that you're picking and buying and selling and day trading or whatever. All you have to do is when you take money out of the account. When it sits in cash, well, it's still inside the account, so you don't have to take that out of the account if you're going to measure the return of that account. That's the way I would do it if I were you. And if it turns out you're really as talented as you say you are, you've got to ask yourself, are you lucky or are you good? And if you have a conviction that you're good, you ought to go start raising capital, start investing money for more than just yourself and start running a hedge fund or whatever. Because I know a lot of people that would love to have 25% a year returns. You can own the entire world in like one generation or two generations if you can get 25% returns a year. They're pretty awesome. QUOTE OF THE DAY Our quote of the day today comes from Abraham Lincoln, who said, “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.” I think there's a lot of wisdom there. INTRODUCING BONDS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO Ricardo has got a question about bonds. Let's take a listen to your question, Ricardo. Ricardo: Hey Jim, it's Ricardo in South Florida. I have a question about investing in bonds. I am in agreement with the three-fund portfolio investment philosophy. With that in mind, I already have VTI and VXUS in my investment portfolio. And I've never actually had bonds before. I want to introduce them. I was wondering how I should do this. Some background, I am 50 years old, primary care internal medicine doctor. I have a small amount of student loans, about $30,000 at 2.75% and a mortgage about $200,000 for my home at 2.75% also. I don't have a lot of space in my tax protected account because I've been doing the backdoor Roth IRAs and I don't have a traditional IRA. My question is, since I need to invest in taxable accounts in my brokerage account at Vanguard, how should I go about doing this? I am in agreement with your recommendations to do 50% in tax protected bonds and 50% in inflation protected bonds. The question is then, which bond ETF or mutual funds should I choose for my taxable brokerage account at Vanguard? Like I said, I do live in Florida, so I don't have state taxes, but I do want to avoid federal income taxes. Thanks for everything you do. And I really appreciate your help. Dr. Jim Dahle: All right. There's a lot in that question, Ricardo. You stuffed a lot into 90 seconds, however long your recording was. Let's talk about the three-fund portfolio for a minute. This was made famous by my friend, Taylor Larimore. He published a book. I think it's called The Boglehead's Guide to the Three-fund portfolio. And I don't know that the Bogleheads ever really sponsored or voted to authorize this book being published. Taylor just published it. And Taylor likes his three-fund portfolio. But the truth is, I don't know that there's any defined three-fund portfolio other than what he said it was in his book. This is a Taylor thing, not even necessarily a Bogleheads thing, but it's become very popular over time. And per Taylor, the fund is a total international stock market index, a total stock market index, US stocks, and the total bond market index. So, it's US bonds, US stocks, and international stocks. That's the three-fund portfolio. And there's lots of Bogleheads that like this. It's relatively easy to implement because there's only three investments, three asset classes. And it's pretty straightforward to do. And it's probably good enough. The truth about portfolios is you just need good enough. You get a portfolio that's good enough, you fund it adequately, and you stick with it long term, it'll probably do you just fine. There are some awesome things about the portfolio. First of all, you can buy these investments at just about any type of brokerage. And most 401(k)s will have something pretty darn similar to these funds. And so, it's relatively easy to implement in all of your accounts. Even if you want to implement it in your HSA and your 529, your Atlas, you can do that because these funds tend to be very, very widely available. They can be very cheap. If you're buying them at Schwab and Vanguard and iShares and Fidelity, you can get these funds very, very cheap, basically free. You can buy all the stocks in the world and all the bonds in the US for less than 10 basis points, which is essentially free. It's free, it's very broadly diversified. And Taylor likes it. And he's 100 years old, 101, 102, whatever he is this year. So why not? But I wouldn't feel like you have to invest in this portfolio. There are lots of reasonable portfolios. All you have to do is pick reasonable, fund it adequately, and stick with it. Those are my thoughts on the three-fund portfolio. This dogmatic approach to it that you see sometimes, particularly on the Bogleheads forum, I'm not a huge fan of. In fact, I once wrote one of my most popular blog posts called 150 Portfolios Better Than Yours. I think I've got 200 portfolios on it now. But the point was that any of these are okay. Don't get too fixated on the 3 Fund portfolio or any other portfolio, really. Okay, assuming you still want the three-fund portfolio after that diatribe, the question is where you should put it. First of all, we got to address something else. The other thing you mentioned was my recommendation of half your bonds in tax-protected bonds and half in inflation-indexed bonds. Number one, I don't have a recommendation about bonds. I don't have a WCI-approved or recommended portfolio. Pick something reasonable, stick with it. My portfolio, half the bonds are nominal and half of them are inflation-indexed, and I think that's a reasonable thing to do. But there's a big wide range of what reasonable is when it comes to bonds in your portfolio. And all you have to do is get in that range, fund it adequately, and stick with it. All right, you want to put your bonds, it sounds like, in taxable. And that's fine. At these interest rates we have these days and the higher interest rates, it often makes sense to have your bonds in a tax-protected account because they're not very tax-efficient investments. The entire return is essentially paid out every year and it's taxed at ordinary income tax rates. So, it's not very tax-efficient investment. A lot of times, unless interest rates are really low, people will try to have it inside tax-protected accounts. Typically when people are having to put something into a taxable portfolio, they're moving the most tax-efficient thing first, which is often something like the Total Stock Market Index Fund. If I had to choose between the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the Total International Stock Market Index Fund, and the Total Bond Index Fund, and I had to move one of them to my taxable account, the first one I'd move would be the Total Stock Market Index Fund because I think it's the most tax-efficient of those three funds. Not nearly all the return is paid out. The yield right now on that is like 1.2%. So if this thing's making 10% a year on average long-term, it's only paying out like one-tenth of that, a little more than one-tenth of that in income a year. So most of the return doesn't get taxed every year. And what is paid out is almost all qualified. I was just looking it up this morning for a blog post I was doing, 97% of the dividends out of the Total Stock Market Index last year that I received were qualified dividends. It's a very, very tax-efficient investment. It's not the most tax-efficient investment, but it's very, very tax-efficient. If you can, most of the time, people try to keep their bonds in their 401(k) or something, and put their stocks, particularly US stocks these days, in their taxable account. But if you have to put bonds in taxable, and our taxable account has gotten so large relative to our tax-protected accounts that we have to invest in bonds in taxable if we want to have bonds. And we do. The bonds we have in our taxable account, for the most part, especially on the nominal side, are municipal bonds. And that's because we're in a high tax bracket. We're in the top tax bracket. And so, if you're in a high tax bracket, you will probably find that your after-tax return from municipal bonds is higher than your after-tax return from a regular bond fund, like total bond market fund, the one in the three-fund portfolio. Keep that in mind. If you're really going to put them in taxable, maybe your three-fund portfolio is the total stock market index fund, the total international stock market index fund, and the municipal bond index fund at Vanguard. I think it's available in an ETF as well if you want that version of it. If you want to have some inflation index bonds in there as well, well, you're talking about a four-fund portfolio. But you could put a bond fund in there that owns TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, into your taxable account. We do have to do that as well. Like I said, we have a bigger asset location problem than most people do. Certainly, TIPS are one of the last things I would move out of tax-protected accounts. They can be kind of annoying for various reasons. They're a little bit complex as far as how they pay out the return. And particularly if you're buying individual TIPS, you get phantom income. You got to pay taxes on it, but you didn't actually receive the income. So it's definitely better to have in a tax-protected account than most things that you can put into a tax-protected account of some type. I hope that's helpful. But if you're putting bonds in a taxable account and you're listening to the White Coat Investor podcast, there's a good chance those bonds should be municipal bonds. Municipal bonds, the interest they pay out is federal income tax-free. If they are state-specific bonds to your state, they might also be state tax-free. Obviously, in Ricardo's case, he's in Florida, he doesn't have a state tax. He could just use a general municipal bond fund like the excellent ones offered by Vanguard that we use. That's how I would implement a three-fund portfolio. If I had to put the bond in a taxable account and I were in a high income tax bracket, I'd use municipal bonds. Hope that's helpful. All right, if you need some help in getting educated, you need to become more financially literate, you need some help putting your plan together, but you don't want to pay thousands for a financial advisor, we have a course for that. If you want to get into real estate investing, we have a course for that.

Okay, we've talked about bonds, we've talked a little bit about tracking returns, let's talk about gold. Everyone likes to talk about gold, especially when gold has done well more recently, and then of course, you don't hear about it for a decade, because that's the way gold is. It has good returns for a year or two and then nothing for 15 years, and then good returns for a year or two. That's kind of the way gold's been historically. But let's listen to the question, see if we can answer it. IS INVESTING IN GOLD POINTLESS? Speaker: Hi, Dr. Dahle, I'm a radiologist in the Southeast and I have a question about gold. I don't invest in it, but I do see it as an asset class and I hear people going to it as a flight to safety, buying bullion from Costco and things like that. But I'm skeptical that in the times that you would really need gold, that you could get your value for it, that you put in. Even though it's increased in value over time, it seems like the times that people are buying it for would be times that were duress, disasters, and times when these things would be illiquid and you could run the risk of then losing your gains or a lot of your investment, having to sell at a relative loss when you really desperately need the money. I'm curious about the sale component of investing in gold. Thanks. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, those who know about my portfolio know I don't own gold. I don't own silver, I don't own platinum, I don't own precious metals ETFs. I really don't invest in this asset class at all. I've got some gold in my finger. Katie's got a little bit of platinum on her finger. Although when I got her a 25th anniversary ring, we decided to go with white gold rather than platinum, mostly due to my experience of cutting rings off people in the emergency department. It's way easier to cut through gold than any of these other fancy metals, by the way. If I have to go through like three blades in a half hour of trying to get your ring off, you've picked the wrong precious metal. But precious metals as an investment, I'm not a big fan of. And the reason why is because they are a speculative investment. Now by speculative, I don't mean it's risky or it's stupid or something like that. When I say speculative, I mean that it doesn't produce anything. Bonds produce interest. You put your money in your savings account, it pays interest. If you buy a stock, you get the earnings of the stock. If you buy real estate, you earn rents. These are productive assets. Gold is not a productive asset. It is a speculative asset. Other speculative assets include empty land, include Bitcoin and other sorts of crypto assets. Commodities, anything that's not producing something is a speculative asset. Just as a general rule, I don't invest in those. So I don't invest in gold. Now I have to speculate on why some people do. Some people see that gold went up and they want to buy it. There's a lot of people out there that's seriously the way they invest. They own Bitcoin because Bitcoin went up, not because they bothered learning about any sort of blockchain technology or they're into it or they have a deep-felt conviction on the long-term use of Bitcoin as a currency or anything like that. They're like, “Bitcoin go up, must buy Bitcoin.” Same thing with gold. That's why people buy it. My parents, many of you know, I helped take over their portfolio a little over 20 years ago and they're maybe not the most informed investors. Luckily, they haven't had to be for the last 20 years. But at one point when I was a child, I remember there was a bucket of silver coins in my closet. They've subsequently liquidated that, but somebody told them silver was a great investment and silver was going through the roof and so they bought a bucket of them and for some reason hid them in my closet. I don't know how much a bucket of silver coins was worth back then, but this was probably the 80s. So it was probably worth something pretty good. I never was smart enough to grab all the silver and run, but that's how people invest in this stuff. I don't know what they're thinking. Think about the last 100 years. We've had lots of bad economic times happen in the last 100 years. We went through a pandemic when you couldn't even get toilet paper. Interest rates went up 4% or 5% in a single year in 2022. In 2008, the world's financial markets were going to crash. Our real estate went in a hole that it didn't recover from for a decade. We look at 2000. The dot-com crash. We look at the 1970s with stagflation. We look at a day in 1987 when the markets dropped 22% in a single day. We've had World War I and World War II and the Korean War and the Vietnam War and a couple of wars in the Gulf. And we spent 20 years in Afghanistan. Had the Great Depression. We've had multiple depression-like events in the 1800s. All these things that have happened. Now, if we think back to all of those, in which of those times did you take a hunk of gold bullion down to the store and buy your groceries and buy your gasoline and exchange it for something you needed? None of them. This idea that this flight to safety, this asset you can have when times are really bad is a little bit hokey. If you really end up in the zombie apocalypse, nobody's going to want your stupid gold. They want bullets. They want canned goods. Have you guys watched The Walking Dead? Nobody's looking for gold in The Walking Dead. They're looking for someplace safe. They're looking for some weapons. They're looking for some food. They're looking for some gasoline. Those sorts of things. They're not looking for gold. I don't know what your plan is to spend this in a terrible economic downturn. Are you going to slice little bits off it like a little loaf of bread and weigh them on a scale and use that to buy things? What's your plan, really, when it comes to gold? It probably doesn't make any sense to use it in that sort of a thing. Now, I know people escaped Nazi Germany with some gold in their pockets or some jewelry in their pockets or diamonds or something like that. But the truth is, if that's what you need to do, if you need to get value across an international border without getting caught, I think you're much better off with a crypto asset. This is one of the few really great use cases for Bitcoin. I probably wouldn't use gold for that. So if that's what you're buying gold for, probably think about Bitcoin instead. Why do people buy gold? Well, they buy gold because gold went up. And gold's gone up now for the first time in a long time. Just looking at the historical price of gold, if you pull up a chart on Google, I see, okay, this is pretty exciting here. I see in 2015, it was like a little over $1,000 an ounce. And now it is $3,400 an ounce. It's worth three times as much as it was 10 years ago. This is why people are interested in gold. But if you actually go back to some sort of historical numbers, you'll see probably a different scenario. Okay, here's gold price over the last 100 years. It was super high in the 1970s. $2,400 an ounce in like 1978 or something like that. And then it plummeted to $400 an ounce during the tech run-up, the late 1990s. That's kind of what gold does. And now it's back up to $3,500 an ounce or something. But basically, if you look at gold, the price of gold over the last 800 years or so, it basically keeps up with inflation over the long-term, but with dramatically more volatility. 800 years ago, an ounce of gold bought a nice man's suit. And today, an ounce of gold buys a nice man's suit. It keeps up with inflation and that's about it. So that's what I would expect out of gold. I would expect to do nothing for many years, maybe decades, and then have a spectacular two or three or four years, and that to all average out to more or less inflation in the long run. I don't make recommendations on what to have in your portfolio. If you want gold in there, keep it to less than 10% of the portfolio. A single digit kind of number, it's fine. If you want to stick with it for the long run, you say, I'm going to put 5% in gold. I think that's fine. There'll be times when it does well, like the last decade, especially the last few years, there'll be times when it does poorly like the 1990s. But if you're willing to stick with it through thick and thin, you keep it to a small percentage of your portfolio, I think it's fine to have it in your portfolio. I'm not going to put it in mine. Not only does it not produce anything, but it costs something to maintain. You got to pay to store it. You got to pay to protect it and insure it. And I don't know. It's just not a very attractive asset class to me. But if you want it, I think it's fine. I'm going to tell you the same thing about it. I'm going to tell you about Bitcoin. Single digit percentage of your portfolio. And if it does really well over a few years, don't let it start dominating the portfolio. If it's crept up to 20% of your portfolio, you need to sell some of it and diversify. All right, let's talk about something else. No one wants to talk about boring old stock index funds. Everyone wants to talk about something else, even though 85% of my portfolio is in boring old stock index funds. And hopefully a very large percentage of yours is in boring old stock index funds. But it's hard to fill 52, 30 to 60 minute long podcasts a year, talking only about boring old index funds. I don't know what else to tell you about them. Go buy a bunch of index funds. They're boring, but they really work if you hold onto them long-term and you're very well diversified. It's basically free to buy all the most profitable corporations in the history of the world. But apparently now we need to talk about private equity. INVESTING IN PRIVATE EQUITY Ash: Hello, Jim, this is Ash from Virginia. I was speaking with my financial advisor recently, and he recommended that I invest in private equity as a way to diversify and reduce market correlation. Otherwise, I am heavily invested in index funds, Vanguard index funds. I was wondering if you thought this was a good idea, neutral, or a bad idea. Thank you so much. Dr. Jim Dahle: The problem I have with private equity is that the term is so broad, it means almost nothing. All private means is that it's not traded on the stock market. Private equity is all the businesses in the world that are not traded on the stock market. That includes the self-employed person in some developing country in Africa and a sheep herd. Private equity. He raises the sheep, he sells the sheep for profit, he gets some milk from the sheep, whatever. Private equity. The White Coat Investor, private equity. It's privately owned. It's not owned by the stock market. It's not owned publicly, so it's private equity. A lot of real estate is private equity real estate. If you're investing on the equity side, not the debt side, it's private equity real estate, and obviously I own some of that. Some of our advertisers on this podcast offer private equity real estate investments. When we talk about private equity, it's a little hard to know exactly what people are talking about, but it's this cool catchphrase that everybody thinks sounds really smart, and so everyone says, “I should invest in private equity. You have any private equity investments?” And guess what? If you ask for it, and it can be sold, and a profit can be made on it, somebody will offer you that to invest in. Whether you should invest in it or not is a completely different story. There's lots of benefits to being in the public markets. You get very liquid investment. It's very transparent, it's regulated. The price changes minute by minute throughout the trading days, so you're always getting current pricing. There's lots of benefits of being in the public markets. There are also benefits to being in the private market. Imagine if we had to figure out what White Coat Investor was worth every day, and that affected how we ran the company. You don't need those sorts of pressures, and lots of other people have decided, “I don't need those sorts of pressures in my business either, so I'm going to stay private.” Even public corporations sometimes go private. They basically get bought out, and somebody takes them private, they're no longer traded on the stock market. So lots of ways that you can invest in private equity. But there's lots of funds out there that call themselves private equity funds, and they're doing all kinds of different things. Sometimes they use a whole bunch of leverage, and they're buying something and trying. This is what happens with physician groups and hospitals, they try to pull as much profit out of it as they can, and then resell it in three or four or five years for a higher profit. And obviously, you know how that affects how that business runs. You've seen it happen in your hospitals, you've seen it happen in your physician groups, lots of things implode. It can be pretty bad when something's backed by private equity. Those of you who have been sending emails to me about this hospital corporation that's gone bankrupt, it owned my hospital just a year or two ago, and it wasn't good. While the CEO and other staff were enriching themselves off the money in the company and running it into the ground, we couldn't get somebody to come fix the CT scan. They wouldn't come out because they hadn't been paid in six months when the CT scan broke. So we were literally putting people in an ambulance to send them to another campus of our hospital to get a CT scan. Meanwhile, that campus was sending people to our campus in order to get ultrasounds. And we were going to a third campus to get MRIs. It's ridiculous. If you run businesses primarily for profit, they usually don't last very long. You got to put the mission before profit. I mean, no margin, no mission, but you got to put the mission before profit or the company's just not going to be around very long. And that's what a lot of private equity type investments have been accused of. So, keep that in mind if you decide you want to support that sort of model by doing that. Okay, now there is a big trend toward this though. In fact, Vanguard just announced a partnership and I was hoping not to talk about this until the fall when it's really a little bit more sorted out exactly what they're doing. But they've launched a partnership, I think with BlackRock to have some sort of private public fund they can offer to their advised clients and even their non-advised clients with this idea that adding some private equity to your portfolio can juice your returns. Well, maybe it can, maybe it can't, time will tell. I don't have plans right now to add a private equity fund to my portfolio. I certainly have plenty of my net worth invested in private equity already with the White Coat Investor. And I've got a good chunk of my real estate on the private side as well. So, here's my cautions for private investments. One, you often need to be an accredited investor to buy them. The rules for that, the legal rule is you got to make $200,000 plus a year for each of the last two years, or you got to have a million dollars in investable assets. That is an inadequate rule in my opinion. If you're going to invest outside the publicly traded markets, I think you need to be a real accredited investor. And I define that number one, as you can evaluate the investment without the assistance of an advisor, accountant or attorney. And number two, that you can lose your entire investment without really affecting your financial life in any significant way. If you meet those two criteria, I think it's fine to wade into the private markets and buy some investments. You still need to follow the good principles of diversification and portfolio construction. You want high returning assets with low correlation with each other. You're trying to build a portfolio here, not just build a collection of investments. Keep that in mind, but I think it's okay to add some private investments to your portfolio. Keep in mind the liquidity issues in the private markets. And often you can't get your money back for years. If you needed a whole bunch of money this year, you're not going to be able to get it. Only some of your portfolio is appropriate being illiquid investments. Keep that in mind, but I don't know that you're going to juice your returns in the private equity markets. Maybe you'll have higher returns. Maybe you'll have higher risk adjusted returns. Maybe they'll have a low correlation with your publicly traded investments, but it feels faddish to me. It feels like a trend. So, let's watch it. There's no rush to invest in anything. Let's see how this Vanguard partnership goes. There's a bunch of other ones coming out this fall as well. Let's watch them for a year or two, see what they do and decide, “Hey, is this something I want to add a slice of to my portfolio or not?” Keep in mind, this is a game with no called strikes. You don't have to swing at any given investment. You can just let them keep on coming by and you don't have to invest in everything to be successful. You don't have to have gold and Bitcoin and private real estate and private equity and all this stuff, small value stocks and Hong Kong stocks. You don't have to have all this stuff to be successful. You need something like three to 10 asset classes in your portfolio. You want each asset class to be broadly diversified like what you'd get in an index fund. And then you need to fund it adequately and stick with it in the long-term. That's what leads you to investing success. That's what leads you to completing, reaching your financial goals. That's the goal. Investing is a one person game. It's you against your goals. It's not you trying to beat the market. It's not you trying to beat anybody else. Balance your FOMO against your fear of loss and don't go chasing the latest shiny thing. That's a sure pathway to investment failure. Let's keep an eye out on private equity. I'll be writing more about it, talking more about it this fall. It's definitely out there. It is probably going to show up in some 401(k)s and it's going to show up at your favorite brokerages. But every investment is individual and has to be evaluated on its own merits. It's unlikely there's ever going to be an index fund for private equity investments. All of them have to be looked at individually if you want to invest in them. All right. Thanks everybody out there for what you do. It is not easy work. As I mentioned, I got five shifts this week. I've done three. I got two more in the next two days. And it's good to work like a real doc this week and remind myself of my roots and where I come from and take care of people. There's a lot of people out there who are much less fortunate than we are, who deserve good medical care and they're looking for some relief and comfort in a terrible time in their lives. And it's a pleasure and honor to be able to help them do that. Thanks for those of you who have chosen to do this with your life. And I know some days are rougher than others. And if today's one of those days and nobody told you thanks all day, let me be the first. VANGUARD AND SPEC ID Okay. We need to talk about another issue here. People are hounding me with emails about this issue. I have written the blog post. It's going to run between the time I'm recording this. And when you hear this, this is an issue about a letter Vanguard is sending out. Let's hear the question to start with. And a bunch of you I know have gotten this letter. Marcy: Hi Jim, this is Marcy from the Midwest. Quick question. Got a letter from Vanguard saying that they are no longer doing Spec ID as the preferred cost basis method for their holdings. And now they're going to an automated either first in first out, a minimum tax or a highest in first out option when selecting for cost basis. They say that it's to help with automation of certain loss. We use the spec ID to help with tax loss harvesting. Do you have an opinion on how this affects us or which one we should choose? Thank you so much. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay. First of all, go back and read the blog post. It's scheduled to run on August 2nd. That should be before you ever hear this podcast. But the letter they're sending you says this. It says, “Dear investor, whatever your name is, we noticed you've selected specific identification as your preferred cost basis method for certain holdings in your account. While you'll still be able to use spec ID for individual transactions. While you'll still be able to use spec ID for individual transactions.” Did you hear that? Nothing else matters in this letter. You'll still be able to use Spec ID for your individual transactions. I use specific identification. Cause I do the same thing you do. I'm tax loss harvesting and I want to harvest the losses. All they're asking here you to do is they're asking you to pick an automated method of cost basis. In the event that you had some sort of automated thing set up, for instance, you had set it up such that it automatically sends you $400 a month out of your brokerage account so you can live on it. Well, it needs to know, well, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to do first in first out? Are we supposed to do min tax? Are we supposed to do highest in first out? That's all they're asking. But hopefully you're not selling any of your taxable holdings that way. You're specifically identifying which tax slots you want to sell from. And so long as you do that, this question doesn't matter at all. Doesn't matter what you pick. But if for whatever reason it happened automatically, you probably want it to do what they call min tax or minimum tax, because that's what you do most of the time when you're trying to sell your shares is you want the one that's going to cost you the least in taxes. Choose min tax and recognize that when you go in there to tax loss harvest your taxable account, you're still going to be able to do specific identification. Then go check out that blog post if you want to hear about all the other methods of cost basis methods. I got all the ones in there from Fidelity and there's way more at Fidelity than there is a Vanguard. All the ones in there from Schwab. They got all these cool ones, low cost short term and high cost long term and tax sensitive short term and tax lot optimizer. There's all these other methods of cost basis selection out there. But just set it as min tax and recognize you can still do specific identification when you actually go in there to sell shares. Hopefully that's helpful. All right, I think we've got another question here from Ricardo. Maybe it's the same Ricardo as the other question but let's take a listen. TAX LOSS HARVESTING Ricardo: Hey Jim, this is Ricardo again. I had a question regarding tax loss harvesting. I do own my own internal medicine primary care practice and I've had it for the last 16 years so I anticipate eventually to sell it and at that point make a capital gains and be responsible for that tax. One strategy I wanted to use is to have tax loss harvesting and use those losses to offset that capital gains when I do sell my practice. My question is how to exactly do this? And I know you did an excellent post detailing in detail through Vanguard how to do the tax loss harvesting. But on an emotional basis, when I do see a loss, let's say there's $50,000 loss in my portfolio, I get nervous because I've always heard “Don't sell low and don't sell a loss”, but that's exactly what we're doing when we tax loss harvesting. Now, I understand you have to buy another stock which is similar but not identical, but emotionally I just have a hard time selling when I'm at a loss. So just please reassure me that this is the right process that you do sell a loss, but then you buy another stock which is similar but not identical. If I don't feel comfortable doing this, do you think that's something for tax loss harvesting? Is that something that's worthwhile getting one of the recommended financial advisors on your website? Thanks again and really, really appreciate everything you do for us. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, good question. First, let's talk about the emotional aspect here. These are losses, it hurts to sell low. You don't want to buy high and sell low. That's a recipe for investment disaster and financial catastrophe. But that's not what you're doing when you're tax loss harvesting. You are selling low and buying low. You are exchanging. You're really not changing your portfolio at all. I hope you're not investing in individual stocks because it's really hard to tax loss harvest because you know what? Tesla is not the same as Microsoft. You cannot get something very similar when you're tax loss harvesting individual stocks. It's very hard. Maybe there's something similar, but for most of them, there's nothing that's really very similar. That's not the case when you're using ETFs or mutual funds. You can sell the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and you can buy the iShares Total Stock Market Index Fund 18 seconds later and you've sold low and bought low. And you basically have the same portfolio, but you know what? When you get your 1099 div at the end of the year, you're going to have that $50,000 tax loss and you can save those up. You can only use $3,000 a year against your ordinary income. You can use an unlimited amount against tax gains, but hopefully you're not generating too many of those throughout your career. And then hopefully you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars of these tax losses saved up for the end of your career when you sell your practice. By the way, great job establishing a practice and building some value there that you'll be able to sell later. But this would be great. If you could line up half a million dollars of tax losses throughout your career and then you sell this practice for $750,000, that's $500,000 of that gain that you don't have to pay taxes on. That might save you $100,000 in taxes. It can be a lot of money. That's the idea behind tax loss harvesting. I tend to do mine manually. I think maybe someday I'll sell the White Coat Investor. Tax losses would be pretty useful to me. So I keep acquiring them, even though I have far more than I'll ever need at $3,000 a year. And I really don't expect to ever realize any capital gains in my taxable ETF portfolio. We tend to flush them out doing charitable giving. And our basis really isn't even all that low, but we keep acquiring these tax losses just in case we sell our house or we sell our business or whatever. We're doing the same thing you are. Now, there are companies that try to get you more tax losses out there. They maybe have a special algorithm where they're trying to do this with various ETFs or they're doing direct indexing. And if their fees are very, very low, it's possible that the tax losses will be more valuable than what you're paying in those fees, but you have to be careful. If you're paying 0.7 or 0.8% a year just for tax losses, you're not going to have the value there that you're looking for. And certainly if you're going to a full service advisor that's charging you 1% a year on a multimillion dollar portfolio, I'm not sure the value's there either, especially compared to what you can do yourself. This isn't that complicated. It sounds like you're managing your portfolio yourself. This is not a big add to somebody. You can handle the rest of their portfolio chores. But if you need some help, it doesn't hurt to go use one of these financial advisors that specializes in validators that helps you teach you some things for a year or two, and then you can go out on your own. It's not like you have to use the advisor for the rest of your life just because you needed some help learning how to do some of these things. A lot of those people on our recommended list do specialize in helping validators to become do-it-yourselfers, but the value of tax losses depends on your financial life. You sound like you are going to have a big taxable gain at some point in your life so you have a little more value to a tax loss than other people do. I think it's well worth learning how to do this yourself and it's probably worth considering getting somebody to help you do it professionally. I think we covered on this podcast a few months ago direct indexing. You could convince me that paying 10 basis points a year to do direct indexing might be worth it for you given your situation, but I don't know that everybody needs to do that sort of a thing. Really you have to step back and ask yourself “How much are additional tax losses worth to me?” Because just about every White Coat Investor with a taxable account can get enough of them pretty darn easily to have $3,000 a year to use against their ordinary income.

Red Rock probably is. And we're even closer to Red Rock than we are to the Strip. Early bird registration is going to start at the 1st of September. So, put a reminder on your calendar, register with the lowest prices we're going to offer from here till the conference at whitecoatinvestor.com/wcicon.

Okay, we've got a unique milestone today, as you heard with the title of this podcast. But yes, we're still going to be talking about finances. This is a finance podcast. You can't come on here with milestones that aren't financial, just FYI. We've got to twist whatever milestone you've accomplished and still talk about finances to inspire others to really take the wheel and take advantage of all the wonderful things that are available to them in this world, if you can manage your finance as well. Stick around after this interview. I want to talk for a few minutes about sequence of returns risk and some of the methods to deal with it. If that term is totally new to you, you definitely want to stick around after this podcast. INTERVIEW Our guest today on the Milestones to Millionaire podcast is Adam. Adam, welcome to the podcast. Adam: Thanks, Jim. Really love your podcast. I'm so glad I can be a part of it today. Dr. Jim Dahle: Well, we're excited to have you on this. This is actually the last of five podcasts I'm recording today, which is always fun to have a really great one at the end. And this one's going to be a little bit unique. Let's give people a sense of where you're at in life. What part of the country do you live in? What do you do for a living? How far are you out of your training? Adam: All right, I live in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I'm a non-operative sports medicine physician and I am coming up on 12 years out of training. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, very cool. All right, tell us what milestone we're celebrating today. Adam: Well, this year, my squirt hockey team that my son plays on won the Wisconsin State Championship. Dr. Jim Dahle: That's pretty awesome. Okay, for those who aren't aware, squirts are like nine and 10 years old are basically what squirts are. Adam: Exactly, yep. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, you won the state championship and that's no small feat in Wisconsin. You're not in Utah here. We have hockey here. We're really proud we've got an NHL team now but let's be honest, we are not a huge hockey state like Minnesota and Michigan, Alaska, et cetera. So this is no small accomplishment in Wisconsin. But as I told you before we started recording, we can't just celebrate state championships. So we got to delve a little bit into the financial aspects of this. What is it in your life that has allowed you to spend enough time coaching that you can have a state championship team? Adam: Well, I would say my story starts coming out of residency and reading books like yours right away. That was right about the time I graduated was when your book came out and following a solid financial plan over the last decade has really allowed me to set things up to where I don't have to worry about money anymore and I'm at a stage in life where I can really just focus on the things that matter now like my faith and my family and my health. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Would you describe yourself as financially independent already or you just feel like you're on the fast track to get there? Adam: I would say I'm at coast fire at this point. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Adam: If I don't put anything else into retirement from now until I retire, I'll be good. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. I'm not sure we've done coast fire as a milestone. We should have done coast fire. That's even better. Okay, we got to hear about the hockey team though. Is this a travel team? I assume it's a travel team if there's a state championship. Adam: Yes, this is a travel team. We travel all over the place in Wisconsin. We live about an hour away from the Twin Cities and so we probably play a third of our games against teams in Minnesota which really has helped to grow our program and advance. Just blessed to have a group of kids that really works hard and they all push themselves and as a result, we've had really a lot of success this year and it culminated with a state championship which was really cool. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, that's very fun. You got a kid on the team, I assume? Adam: Yes, I've got my my second of four, Sam, he's just turned 11 but he was on the team. He had a great year. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, what position does Sam play? Adam: Sam is the center. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, what line is Sam on? Is Sam the first line center? Adam: We rotated two centers on three lines this year and I would say they're pretty equal. It really didn't matter who started. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool, very fun. At some point along the way this year, especially with you going all the way to the state championship, there were some times when that really didn't work well with work. So, tell us what you did with work when there were conflict. Adam: If I had over a month notice, I could take the time off. What a lot of people don't know is that youth sports and as a sports medicine physician, this is the world I live in, youth sports has kind of taken over and so a lot of tournaments now start on Friday and they might even start on Friday morning. Dr. Jim Dahle: You have to travel Thursday night. Adam: Sometimes, yes, but most of the time it's just early Friday morning. I probably missed the coolest game of the year this year. We played in a tournament in Minnesota and the opposing team coaches were Zach Parise and David Dubnik from the Wild. And so their kids were on the other bench and that was the game I missed. Dr. Jim Dahle: Did your team win the game? That's the question. Adam: No, actually. I'll make an excuse. The Minnesota kids, they had to use a different birth year. It's June to June or July to July and in Wisconsin, we're January to January. So our kids are ballpark six months younger than their kids, which makes a little bit of a difference in youth sports, especially at this age. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah. Well, it's interesting is a lot of people don't know this, but some huge percentage, I don't know what it is, 63% or 70% of NHL players are born in January to March. Adam: Yes. Dr. Jim Dahle: And the reason why is because they're just a little bit older. And so at every level, they're a little bit older, a little bit better than their peers. And so, those are the ones that end up in the NHL eventually. It's a really curious statistic. Okay, sometimes you've got to be there on Friday and what? You rely on your partners, you cancel clinic. What do you do when that happens? Adam: I usually am booked out about a week. And so, if I got 30 days notice, I can just shift. I'm not having to really cancel patients. One of the things that I noticed after probably about six years in the area that I'm in is that no matter how hard I work, my system is going to give me about 80 patients a week. And if I can do that in five days a week, great. There was a point a few years ago that I realized I could really do that in four days a week. And so, I take one day a week off and I just get all the patients in the rest of the time. And it's allowed me to see everybody that I need to see through my system, but also has given me a little bit more family time, a little more time to get things ready, to get practices planned, to get to connect with my wife a little more. All those things have happened, I guess, happenstance. But that's really worked out because of being paid on production, I can work four days a week and see the same number of people. And I never took a pay cut when I dropped my FTE. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, very cool. And those other things, of course, are what life's really made out of, right? All these other things that really are the priorities. Sometimes we don't always remember that or always treat them that way, but they are the priorities. Okay, give us a sense. You got more than one kid in travel sports, I'm guessing. Adam: We have four right now. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah. Okay, let's talk about the expense of travel sports. What's it cost to be a player on your state championship team? What did parents spend this year to have a kid on that team? Adam: $1,500 was the association fee to join the team, about an extra $200 for jerseys, and then four weekends in hotels, each weekend ballpark $500. Dr. Jim Dahle: Well, you clearly are in Wisconsin and Minnesota, if you can get the whole weekend. Adam: Yeah, I guess you call it geographic arbitrage. Dr. Jim Dahle: That's it. That's pretty good. Plus gear, of course. Hockey gear is not trivial. Adam: Now, hockey is you roll right from the winter season into a spring season, and then you've got a camp all summer, and they're trying to get my kid to play on a fall team now. And I'm going, we need to do some other things. We need to get them, give them a little bit of a break. Dr. Jim Dahle: Find a little bit of balance there. But your team fee is actually significantly cheaper than my kid. My kid's in high school now, but he pays that much just for the high school team. Adam: I played a little bit in med school. I was in New York City, and I played on Chelsea Pier, which is a really cool rink because it's elevated. It's off a ground level. And the fees there, it was like $1,000 every three months. Dr. Jim Dahle: Wow. Just for beer league hockey. Adam: Just for beer league hockey. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, that's pretty wild. I guess that's what you get in a high cost living area. There's a message about geographic arbitrage there somewhere. If you want to play hockey, go to the Northern Midwest rather than Manhattan, I guess. Okay, very cool. Well, this idea of coast fire is something not a lot of people have heard of. And that is a reasonable goal in and of itself. Clearly, early in your career, becoming financially comfortable, whatever, was important to you and your spouse. Why? Why did you end up saving enough money that you now no longer have to save for retirement? Adam: The answer to that question is probably pretty complex. I was really interested in finance during residency and started reading books about it and started initially listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast about getting out of debt. And then when I started to read that and really tackle the debt, that was before student loan advice was available or else I probably would have done the PSLF route. But then I started reading other books that was kind of a snowball into books like yours, where I started learning about all the different retirement accounts that I could invest in and set up. And really throughout the last decade, I just maximized everything that was available. Every year we max out a 401(k), we max out a 457 plan, backdoor Roth IRAs. And then I'm lucky enough to work for a company that also would put about $30,000 every year in addition into retirement. After I had kind of gotten financially literate about four years into training, I approached my system because they weren't offering a mega backdoor Roth and none of our financial people had heard of it. And so kind of talked them into, hey, this is the thing that's available. And after about a year, that was available. And so then I started maxing that out too. Really just have done everything that has been offered. And we kind of look at things where we pay ourselves first, and then we live on what's left over. And right now that's turned into about $2 million in investable assets. Dr. Jim Dahle: Cool. And given that you're only 12 years out of training, there's plenty of time for that double to double once or twice while you're still working, which is pretty cool. Okay, there's somebody out there sitting around going, “Is this all there is to life? I sure would like to spend more time with my family. I'd like to coach a team. I'd like to do some of these things that you're doing in your life now.” What advice do you have for that doc? Adam: The biggest thing is you have to live within your means. You can't spend money that you don't have. That's probably the biggest thing. The way we have our life set up is that most things come out before the paycheck ever comes home. Once the paycheck does come home, we set aside money for our giving every month. And then after that, we live on what's left. And that's been more than enough to cover all of our expenses and everything that we want to do. If there's someone else out there that wants to live life to the fullest, I would say that's the process and the steps. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Adam, congratulations on what you've accomplished. Congratulations to you and your team. Adam: Thank you. Dr. Jim Dahle: And not only your team, including your spouse and kids that have worked on your finances, but your hockey team. It's got to feel pretty good to take them all the way and put that trophy up in the air and have them enjoy that feeling, that accomplishment, even at the young, tender age of nine or ten years old. So, congratulations to all of you. Adam: It's been really, really cool. I also want to put a plug. I know you're a hockey guy. If you're ever interested, Wisconsin hosts the USA National Pond Hockey Championship every year. The way one of my buddies put it, it's like Disneyland for hockey players. And so, it's in Eagle River, Wisconsin, first, second weekend in February every year. They get several hundred teams, 24 rinks. And it is a blast. I know you're an experienced guy, that's an experience. It would be great to have you out sometime to do that. Dr. Jim Dahle: One of my fellow coaches on the high school hockey team went out and played this year. I was coaching while he was playing, but it does sound like a great experience. I would like to come out and maybe we can put together a White Coat Investor pond hockey team and go out there and clean up. Adam: I would imagine there are enough White Coat Investors out there that we could probably field a solid squad. Dr. Jim Dahle: Nice. We'll let you go. Thank you so much for your time. Adam: All right. Thanks, Jim. Dr. Jim Dahle: All right. That was fun. It's always fun to talk to a hockey player and a hockey coach. And it's fun what we can accomplish when we have our finances on track. You can have evenings to spend coaching your kids or whatever else is important to you in life. If you just get your financial ducks in a row, it's part of the why. You got to have a “why” to do all this stuff. So, let's make sure we do that. FINANCE 101: SEQUENCE OF RETURNS RISK I told you at the top of the hour, we're going to talk a little bit about sequence of returns risk, SORR. If you're not familiar with this term, you need to be, particularly if you're getting anywhere near retiree. Sequence of returns risk is the risk that despite having adequate average returns from your portfolio to support your retirement spending, you run out of money because the poor returns came first. That's what sequence of returns risk is. You had a bad sequence. You had the bad returns first before the good returns came. Because when your portfolio is falling in value and you're withdrawing substantial sums from it, it makes it more likely that you run out of money. And now obviously there are other ways to return on money. If you don't manage your money, you're going to run out of money. If you don't save much for retirement, you're probably running out of money in retirement. And if you have some massive, huge, unexpected expenses, like you decided you're not going to buy health insurance and you had a cancer or some terrible trauma you had landed in the ICU for, maybe you run out of money. Or some long-term care situation you weren't prepared for, maybe you run out of money. But for the most part, if you've done a good job saving for retirement, you do a good job managing your money, the risk to worry about is this sequence of returns risk. You have crummy returns in the first one, two, three, five years of retirement. The worry is that you're retiring into the next great depression, that you're retiring into the stagflation of the 1970s. And so, that is something that you probably ought to have a plan for as part of your written financial plan. So, let's talk about what those plans might look like. First of all, one plan that works for lots and lots and lots of White Coat Investors, it's almost a default plan, an error plan, is to just be rich. If you're very wealthy, if you retire very wealthy, sequence of returns risk just doesn't exist for you. Let me give you an example. Let's say we got a retired couple, they spend $200,000 a year. And because they did such a great job earning and saving and investing throughout their career, they retired with $10 million. $200,000 a year of $10 million is 2%. If you're only spending 1 or 2 or 3% of your portfolio a year, you're basically bulletproof from sequence of returns risk. The entire world has to melt down for you to run out of money. This is not the people who really have serious sequence of returns risk. If you're perfectly comfortable spending 1% of your portfolio, you're going to be fine. The truth is on average, if you look at the data used when they're putting together things like the 4% guideline, they note that on average, when people spend 4% of their portfolio, adjusted upward with inflation each year as they go along, after 30 years, on average, they have 2.7 times what they retired with. The sequence of returns issue, the reason why that's only 4% rule instead of the 6% rule or the 8% rule is because occasionally, you get those bad returns first. That is where it comes from. Another solution besides just being really wealthy, if you're not spending anywhere near 4% of your money, that works fine. Another method is to work late and work a long time. Let's say you're one of those docs that just loves it and you keep working until you're 70, 72, 75. Well, guess what? If you're still working until you're 75, your life expectancy is probably something like eight, 10, 12 years, something like that. All these studies that look at sequence of returns risk, they're really looking at 30 year time periods. If you are only going to be retired for a decade before you die, even if you live a little longer than you expect and you make it 15 years, guess what? You're not going to run out of money. The people who really need to worry about sequence of returns risk are the early retirees. If you're retiring at 45, 50, 55, you might have a longer than 30 year time period and maybe that'll result in you spending less than 4% or doing some more of these strategies that I'm going to talk about to deal with that sequence of returns risk. But working late or at least having the ability to go back to work and work some of those years in retirement has a dramatic effect on how all of this works. All of a sudden, instead of having to withdraw a whole bunch of your portfolio in a year the market is down or a couple of year period when the market is down, you can live off some of the money you earn and it just works dramatically better. You don't run out of money. Sequence of returns risk basically goes away. Okay, here's another method. Another method is to guarantee a whole bunch of your income. And now social security is a guaranteed income. Obviously, you got to pay attention to who stands behind the guarantee. In the case of social security, it's the US government. But delaying your social security to age 70 gives you the best deal out there on an inflation adjusted immediate annuity. Basically, you can put the highest floor possible under your guaranteed income, your guaranteed spending. And that can really help a lot in a year when markets are down. There are other sources of guaranteed income. You might have a pension from a job you took. You can also buy an immediate annuity. You can go to insurance company and give them $100,000 and they might give you something as high as $600 a month for that $100,000. Obviously, you can buy more of those. If you want more than $600 of guaranteed spending a month, maybe you can buy a quarter million dollar one on yourself, another quarter million dollar one on your spouse. Now we're talking about $3,000 a month of guaranteed income. So you combine that with your social security and all of a sudden, well, that's not too bad. Even if markets are down, we got to cut back our spending a little bit. We've got all of our essential fixed expenses covered by guaranteed income. That's a method that works very well. Here's another method that works. A big risk in sequence risk and the sequence of returns risk is not just that you have poor returns. It's that you have poor inflation adjusted returns or real returns. The worst time period actually historically, if you look at the data for US stock and bond returns is actually the 70s. And it's not because returns were so terrible. The returns were not good by any means. The problem was inflation went way up. And so, the real returns were really particularly bad. And you can reduce that risk by having more assets in your portfolio that tend to do well in inflationary kind of period. Now you can buy some bonds that are indexed to inflation like I bonds, like treasury inflation, protected securities or TIPS. Those help protect you from inflation rather than having all your bonds in nominal bonds, especially long-term nominal bonds. But just having things in there like real estate and stocks also helps protect you from inflation. Sometimes people add some other stuff, commodities or some crypto assets or some precious metals or things like that to help protect from inflation. That's reasonable to do with a small percentage of your portfolio. But if you think about inflation being the biggest risk you're facing, you'll design your portfolio a little bit differently to try to protect you against inflation rather than having 60% of your retirement portfolio in long-term nominal treasuries, which may not be the best move if inflation really rears its ugly head. The main thing people do when they're worried about sequence of returns risk is they just reduce the volatility of their portfolio. They take less risk. And that's typically during the last few years before you retire in the first five years or so after you retire, more bonds in your portfolio, more CDs, whatever, these fixed income investments that aren't nearly as volatile as your stocks, not nearly as volatile as your real estate. And so, you can just put a little bit more money in bonds. In fact, that's often called a bond tent. You have a few years where you have more of your portfolio in bonds a few years before and after your retirement date. And then you actually can get more aggressive a little bit later with your portfolio once you've gotten through that really bad sequence of returns risk time period. Another thing people will do with bonds is they will actually create a ladder of individual bonds. Typically, these are treasury bonds and typically they're inflation protected bonds. So you're making a TIPS ladder. So you actually put whatever you want to spend for those first five years of retirement into TIPS. Let's say you're going to retire in five years and you want a five-year TIPS ladder to get you through that worst of the sequence of returns risk period. You're buying a five-year TIPS, you're buying a six-year TIPS, a seven-year TIPS, eight-year TIPS, nine-year TIPS. You're buying these TIPS bonds so that you will have that money to spend for that year and maybe you put your entire expected spending amount for that year in TIPS. Maybe it's $100,000 or $200,000 for each of those years and you make your TIPS ladder for it. Well now even if the market tanks the day you retire and it stays down for three, four, five years, you're fine because you don't have to touch that money. You're going to be spending the money coming out of that TIPS ladder every year. Now obviously if you only have a five-year TIPS ladder and you have a nine-year period of terrible returns, you can still have some sequence of returns risk but a five-year TIPS ladder is going to get you through an awful lot of that. Now that's the mindset behind some other strategies. You've heard of the bucket strategy probably and the idea behind that is you put one or two or three years worth of spending in cash and you put you know years four through six or eight or ten in the bonds and after that you invest the rest of the portfolio aggressively. And in a typical year you replenish each of the buckets. You sell some of the bonds and move it into cash, you sell some of the stocks or real estate and move it into bonds and you replenish the buckets. But in a bad year you don't replenish the buckets. You allow your you know more risky assets to continue to grow and you just realize “Hey, that's what this bucket is for. This bucket was for sequence of returns risk. We're just going to spend from it. We won't replenish it until you know the good returns come back in two years or three years or four years or five years or whatever.” That's one strategy people use. People use all kinds of different withdrawal strategies and most of them the goal is to manage sequence of returns risk. A popular one right now is called the guardrails strategy and there's these rules involved in the strategy when returns are this and you do this when returns are this you do that and that helps you decide how much to take out of your portfolio, where to take it from and manage that spending to try to minimize the sequence of returns risk. But the main idea behind it is just to spend less. When the risk shows up you go “Okay, well, I got to cut back.” Now some people are surprised just how much they have to cut back their spending in those years. It's not cutting back your spending just 10%. That'll help but you might have to reduce spending if this is your only method of dealing with sequence of returns risk. You might have to reduce spending by 40 or 50% and for more than a year one two three five years that's possible. So, if your only method of sequence of return risk mitigation is reducing spending you better be prepared to reduce spending a lot in order to make sure you don't run out of money before the end. But that's the concept of sequence of returns risk. Those are the basic ways of dealing with it. You ought to know about what that is. You ought to have a plan for it if you're getting close to retirement. You ought to put that plan into your written financial plan. I hope that's helpful to you. SPONSOR All right.

Title: Property prices rising 11 times faster than wages, with typical value now €370,000

Property prices rising much faster than wages Property prices are rising at multiples of the wage increases workers are receiving. Prices shot up by 8pc in the year to June, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This means the typical, or median, price of a property is now €370,000, up €32,500 in a year. The increase is more than 11 times the amount by which average earnings rose in the last year, according to calculations by independent economist Austin Hughes. Wages increased by around €2,800. The CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie that found Irish house price inflation had reached a 10-year-high. June’s rise of 7.8pc is the same rate of property price inflation recorded in May. New supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases Mr Hughes said house price growth was now steady, but values were still increasing at a strong pace. He said rising employment and falling interest rates were sustaining affordability in the face of rising property prices. “Encouragingly, new supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases,” he said. Sales of new homes were up 22pc in the first half of the year, while sales of second-hand properties were broadly flat. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in which prices have risen, putting the squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing at more than twice the rate of those of new homes. Today's News in 90 Seconds - August 21st A severe shortage of new properties to buy means many first-timers are bidding against those trading up and people who are moving. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and those outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year. The median price of a dwelling bought in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June, 4,029 dwelling purchases were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These comprised 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside Dublin that recorded the largest growth in house prices were the west, comprising Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, at 10.3pc. The midlands recorded price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the south-east area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford recorded a 7.1pc rise in house prices.

Title: Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T03:00:43Z

Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility. The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies. For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements. The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

Also please note, in this August month’s trading, FIIs are net sellers to the tune of Rs 25380 crores. 2) Sticky US PPI inflation which was seen rising in the backdrop of slowing growth. 3) Nasdaq seen sliding on backdrop of massive profit booking amidst magnificent 7 companies which fell further on worries that valuations may have gone. # The Gyan Mantra: Stay light on any excessive intraday strength on Nifty. Makes sense to stay nimble. # The next big catalyst to watch: All eyes will be on the Jackson Hole Symposium, as the street will watch the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled on August 22. # Bottom-line: Nifty may witness some mild profit booking amidst slight overbought technical conditions after the big bang GST reforms buzz. # Nifty View: The intraday/interweek risk shifts to neutral after last 5-days of spectacular gains with key supports to watch at Nifty’s 21-DMA at 24762 mark.

In July, the typical home sat on the market for 43 days—the slowest July pace in a decade—compared to just 16 days in July 2021. Pending home sales fell -1.1% MoM to their lowest since November 2023. Yet prices remain resilient, with the median sales price rising +1.4% YoY to a record July high of $443,867. Many homeowners are opting to rent or delay selling rather than accept lower offers, further tightening supply. In parallel, U.S. industrial policy is shifting. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is exploring the possibility of the government taking equity stakes in Intel and other chipmakers in exchange for grants under the CHIPS Act, which was designed to expand semiconductor manufacturing across the country. According to Lutnick, cash grants approved under the Biden administration could now be tied to equity participation. On trade, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced the U.S.’s hardline stance with China, stating he is “very happy” with the current arrangement. He highlighted that tariffs on Chinese goods remain at 50–55%, generating the largest share of tariff revenues, and dismissed the need for a renegotiated deal: “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Meanwhile, Beijing is weighing a major policy reversal by considering yuan-backed stablecoins to boost global adoption of its currency, signaling a softer approach toward digital assets. On the domestic front, India is eyeing tax relief and industrial reforms. The group of ministers (GoM) on health and life insurance is set to recommend exempting individual insurance premiums from GST, which currently attracts an 18% levy, according to Bihar Deputy CM and GoM convener Samrat Choudhary. Simultaneously, the government is evaluating new measures to strengthen manufacturing competitiveness amid U.S. tariff pressures. Proposals under discussion include interest subventions, new manufacturing clusters near infrastructure hubs, and incentives to attract private capital. On the trade front, India and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan signed terms of reference (ToR) on Wednesday to begin free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. Bilateral trade reached $69 bn in 2024, up 7% YoY, and the pact is expected to unlock untapped potential, boost investment flows, and deepen economic ties. Finally, India’s core sector output showed modest growth of 2% in July, slightly below June’s 2.2%. Weakness in coal, crude oil, natural gas, and refinery products weighed on overall performance, though steel and cement output surged on the back of government capex and strong housing demand. Looking ahead, analysts expect growth to rebound to around 5% in August. Asian market Asia markets mostly rose as investors assessed the four-day losing streak for the S&P 500, led by declines in tech stocks.

(Analysis by Barclays) The minutes of the August RBI MPC meeting suggest that the members found it prudent to pause amid heightened global uncertainty and keep space should the drag on growth amid unfolding trade and tariff talks become more visible. [ On Wedneday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the minutes of the August Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, at which it decided unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 5.5% and the monetary policy stance at “neutral.” ] While the external members of the MPC were mostly dovish, RBI internal MPC members were relatively neutral. Below are the three key takeaways from the minutes: 1) Heightened global uncertainty around tariffs and particularly the protracted India-US trade talks were widely cited as a key monitorable. The evolution of these risks would determine policy space and guide the policy path in upcoming meetings. 2) The very welcome and sharper-than-expected CPI disinflation resulted in a sizable downward revision to the CPI forecast by the RBI. It emanated largely from lower food inflation, which is known to be volatile. This concentrated disinflation lessens the RBI’s confidence around its durability. Accordingly, rather firm core CPI inflation and 4% + forecasts for H1 2026 weighed on their decision making, making a strong case for a pause. 3) All the members lauded the pace of transmission but acknowledged that it was best to wait and see how this permeates to the real economy, given the sizable and front-loaded 100bp repo rate cut.

Vikram Jeet Singh, Partner at BTG Advaya “The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled in Parliament today. This bill seeks to ban “online money gaming”, which is the “depositing of money” for “winning money or other stakes”. This impacts games such as rummy, poker, etc., where winning money is possible. Under Indian law games of skill are legal, and games of chance are considered gambling and prohibited. Wagering money on games of skill was legal until now. The bill in Parliament follows a regulatory trend against RMG even in games of skill – the Madras High Court in June 2025 had upheld restrictions on Real Money Games in Tamil Nadu. Now, pursuant to these new regulations, even games of skill that involve real money can be banned. Advertising RMG will be prohibited and promoting this may lead to sanction for advertisers as well. One reason that has been suggested for this ban is the alleged use of RMG for money laundering activities. India’s online gaming market is valued at almost USD 4 billion, which will take a hit following from this - banning RMG may also have an impact on people employed in the gaming sector. Gaming companies have been subject to a 28% GST levy, in the past. But the bill indicates a move from regulating to banning, when it comes to RMG.” “ We appreciate the government’s suggestion to abolish GST on life and health insurance premiums, as this progressive step will render protection solutions much more affordable and accessible to millions of Indians. Insurance is not just a product, it is an essential safety net that enables people and families to face life with confidence. By abolishing the GST tax, the government has made a customer-centric move that will induce more families, particularly from middle-class and underprivileged sections, to get themselves covered with the proper insurance. This change is also part of the overall dream of ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047, driving greater penetration in urban and rural India. Affordability is a major driver, but we also think it is essential that we tackle some of the structural issues like the inverted duty structure that still affects industry efficiency and margins. A balanced” Godrej Properties Ltd. (GPL), (BSE scrip id: GODREJPROP), one of India’s leading real estate developers, today announced that it has participated in an e-auction conducted by the Telangana Housing Board (TGHB) for Residential Group Housing, where GPL has emerged as the highest bidder for ~ 7.825 acre land parcel in Kukatpally (KPHB), Hyderabad, with a total combined bid value of INR 547.75 crore, according to the bid status intimation email issued by e-auction facilitator MSTC Limited. TGHB shall issue the allotment letter after following the due process. The land parcel is strategically located in a prime location in Kukatpally, in close proximity to HITEC City, and will offer an estimated revenue potential of ~INR 3,800 crore* comprising premium residential apartments of varied configurations. This acquisition builds on the success of GPL’s recent launches in Hyderabad, including Godrej Madison Avenue at Kokapet and Godrej Regal Pavilion at Rajendranagar. With this new project, GPL has further strengthened its presence in one of India’s most dynamic real estate markets. Kukatpally is recognized as one of Hyderabad’s most established and resilient residential corridors. The neighbourhood has set benchmarks for premium housing and is supported by a robust social ecosystem comprising reputed educational institutions, healthcare facilities, retail, and commercial hubs. Its connectivity to HITEC City, one of Hyderabad’s largest employment centers, further enhances its residential appeal. Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties, said, “As Hyderabad continues to strengthen its position as a dynamic real estate market, Kukatpally represents a strategic location that aligns with the city’s growth trajectory. Building on the strong response to our recent launch, Godrej Madison Avenue at Kokapet, our presence here allows us to bring national-scale expertise while designing future-ready developments that create long-term value for our residents.” Eternal, the parent company of Zomato and Blinkit, has indeed made waves with its market cap hitting ₹3.15 lakh crore, surpassing Nifty 50 giants like Wipro (₹2.72L Cr), Tata Motors (₹2.52L Cr), Asian Paints, Nestle India, and Coal India (₹2.40L Cr). This milestone reflects a remarkable 460% stock rally since its IPO in 2021 at ₹116 per share, cementing its status as a new-age powerhouse. Apple is reportedly set to manufacture all four iPhone 17 models (iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max) in India for the US market before their September 2025 launch. This marks the first time Apple will produce all new iPhone variants, including the Pro models, in India from the outset. The production is spread across five factories, including new plants operated by Tata Group in Tamil Nadu and Foxconn near Bengaluru. This shift is part of Apple’s strategy to reduce reliance on China due to geopolitical tensions and tariff risks, with Tata expected to handle nearly half of India’s iPhone output within two years. iPhone exports from India reached $7.5 billion from April to July 2025, reflecting the country’s growing role as a manufacturing hub. According to ICRA, India’s GDP growth for Q1 FY2026 (April-June 2025) is projected at 6.7%, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) estimate of 6.5%. However, this growth is lower than the 7.4% recorded in Q4 FY2025. The Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to ease to 6.4% from 6.8% in the previous quarter. The services sector is anticipated to drive growth, reaching an eight-quarter high of 8.3%, up from 7.3%, supported by robust government spending. Central government capital expenditure surged 52% year-on-year to ₹2.8 trillion, and non-interest revenue expenditure grew by 6.9%. The combined non-interest revenue expenditure of 24 state governments also rose by 10.7%. However, industrial growth is projected to slow to 4.0% from 6.5%, and agriculture to 4.5% from 5.4%, though it remains strong compared to 1.5% in Q1 FY2025. Net indirect taxes are expected to grow in double digits, driven by an 11.3% increase in government indirect taxes, though subsidy contraction slowed to 7.3%. The gap between GDP and GVA growth is projected at 30 basis points, down from 62 in Q4 FY2025. New project announcements nearly doubled to ₹5.8 trillion, and project completions reached ₹2.3 trillion. ICRA notes that improved monetary easing and GST rationalization could boost urban consumption ahead of the festive season, but tariff uncertainties may limit GDP growth to 6.0% for FY2026.

Title: Whales take $16 mln ETH to Bitcoin, yet Ethereum remains strong

Time Published: 2025-08-20T22:00:27Z
Full Content:
Whales flee Ethereum for Bitcoin, but bullish ETH/BTC structure raises questions about altcoin season’s fate. Whales exited Ethereum, swapping $16 million for WBTC, while institutions withdrew $38 million in ETH. Retail holdings dropped, but ETH/BTC held 0.037 support. As the market underwent intense selling pressure, the largest capped cryptocurrency is emerging as the go-to safe haven. Whales and retail traders who panicked swapped Ethereum [ETH] for Bitcoin [BTC], while others closed leveraged trades at losses. Ethereum had outperformed BTC over the last three months. But was this the end of ETH’s relative strength? Some participants seemed to be accepting this as the end of ETH’s outperformance of BTC from their actions. One whale on Hyperliquid lost about $6.22 million in the crypto market crash. This trader had grown his starting capital of $125K to $7 million, with the peak at $43 million. The 4-month profits had been reduced to only $771K after liquidation. Per Lookonchain data, another whale swapped 3,900 ETH worth $16.26 million for 143.26 Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] at 0.03673, signaling capital rotation to BTC. Source: Lookonchain Historically, an ETH/BTC dump coupled with capital rotation has preluded the end of the altcoin season. So, will the narrative hold now? The ETH/BTC ratio held firm at 0.037, above support at 0.033. Its recent peak at 0.039 suggested momentum toward 0.040. Naturally, this pullback could explain liquidations and capital shifts. Yet, the pair has carved higher highs since April’s 0.025 low, keeping the structure bullish. Source: TradingView Anyway, institutional activities on the network and views of legendary traders suggested that the altcoin season was not yet over. Of importance, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale sold Ethereum on Coinbase as per Arkham. This ended their buying streak that started in early this year and intensified in April. The institutions usually sell their tokens at higher levels, prices crash, and then they go long at a cheaper cost. This usually shakes out weak hands. Supporting this intentional manipulation of price was the fact that other institutions were buying. Two institutional addresses withdrew $38 million in ETH from FalconX. CryptoQuant data added nuance. Retail holdings plunged to 8.6 million ETH, while large investors climbed to 10.8 million ETH. Source: CryptoGoos/X The institutional sell-off urged caution. However, confirmation of a cycle break requires ETH to lose bullish structure on higher timeframes.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Quadrant Tony Thomas Australian schools are about to ramp up Net Zero campaigning using the latest movie “Future Council” from dark-green activist Damon Gameau. I’m predicting this with confidence because teachers have drenched more than a million kids from primary classes upwards with Gameau’s previous movie/docos 2040 (2019) and Regenerating Australia (2022). All-up his offerings (at last week) have got to 1,534,783 kids and launched about 50,000 largely school-based “action plans”. How does Gameau, 43, an ex-actor turned producer, achieve his startling reach into classrooms? It’s because all his far-left and environmental causes are taken up by Cool.org. Cool then delivers them as time-saving online lessons to Australia’s eager teachers. I’ve been tracking Cool.org as a cuckoo-in-the-school-nest for a decade, here, here, here, here and here. Formerly Cool Australia, it claims teachers now deliver its all-topics material to 2.5 million schoolkids a year and have reached 92% of schools. The lesson kits are expertly mapped to the curriculum and fulfil the cross-curriculum priority of “sustainability.”[1] As for promoting Gameau, Cool today offers teachers about 35 different lessons on his 2040 movie, and at least seven lessons on Regenerating Australia (37,000 students and 2637 Action Plans). The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner. That includes replacement of capitalism with UK ‘renegade economist’ Kate Raworth’s vision of a “doughnut [circular] economy”. Regenerating Australia likewise is set in 2029, looking back at a decade “that saw Australia transition to a fairer, cleaner, more regenerative economy that values Australia’s greatest assets – First Nations’ wisdom, our unique natural environment and our sense of community.”Now stand by for Future Council’s blitz into classrooms. Gameau spent last month on live Q&A’s at national pre-releases, and launched it officially on August 7. I took in his “inspiring and rollicking journey” at Yarraville’s olde-world Sun Theatre, along with 150 adoring parents and kids. It’s Gameau’s most ambitious venture yet and the audience, already green converts, went wild. Gameau and singer Ruby Rodgers from the film (she’s 15) took questions. Note this Feedback from previews: ♦ nichollerussell: “I can’t wait to see it tonight, I’m bringing my 2 classes or 42 students who are in year 3/4.” ♦ “There’s a lot of darkness in the world right now but holy smokes, @future__council is pure light.” ♦ “I cried through most of the doco. Our natural world is breathtaking, so full of wonder, and these kids remind us just how easy it is to forget that. They are rightfully scared about the future and angry at us adults for not doing enough to ensure their future … If we’re willing to listen, they might just show us the way.” ♦ “Damon Gameau, you’ve done it again. Another film that knocked me off my feet yet left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and more determined to fight for this planet and all who call it home.”Gameau did a global casting call two years back for kids aged 10-14 to star in a road-trip movie traversing eight countries in western Europe in a cute yellow bus. The kids’ brief was to harangue corporate chiefs about emissions and plastic litter. From 1300 applicants, Gameau selected a diverse group of eight, based on their climate-warrior ethos, perkiness and affinity for show biz. Gameau emphasises that his bus ran on planet-friendly vegetable oil. He doesn’t mention the emissions from air-ferrying kids, plus a parent or guardian, to Europe. They came from places afar as Australia, Norfolk Island, Bali, Singapore and Uganda. As if the kids aren’t already brainwashed, he gets high-profile activists to gee them up. His theme is that school strikes haven’t saved the planet, and kids are looking for practical ways to rescue their future and work off their climate angst. The film is his marketing vehicle for his real-world Future Councils of kids, mostly schools-based. He aims to set up them here and worldwide as advisory boards to help reform back-sliding corporates. To make his bus trip look worthwhile, he has to big-up the so-called “climate crisis”. And here’s the rub: the poor little mites are traumatised by climate doom. Sure there’s a happy ending and the kids end the trip full of false hopes. That’s in line with psychs’ advice to scare them into activism, but not enough to paralyse them. Perhaps a bit sadistic? Other reviewers, all but one, gloss over this issue. The exception is James Joyce, executive editor of Australian Community Media and ex-editor of the Canberra Times, who I found in North West Star (paywalled, sadly). Joyce, apparently acquiescent in net-zero, still does a deadly interview of Gameau. Joyce: I started off feeling quite angry about what you were doing to these kids. I felt upset for them – that they were being asked to take all this on when they are just kids. By the end, there is some hope, inspiration, ideas and energy, which is great. But my first question is, are the kids alright? Gameau replied that the kids are not OK because we’re not doing anywhere near enough. They’re the generation that has to live in a polluted world and the point of the film is to let their voices be heard. “We don’t want these children to have to understand the complexities of the system and geopolitics,” he replies. “What the children bring is this refreshing creativity, they also bring a bloody morality that’s really missing from the system right now.” He said many leaders and big corporations are acting like psychopaths because that’s what the system allows: short-term thinking and maximum extraction. “And the children get to say ‘Hang on, where’s the humanity in all this?” Joyce: Are you saying that it’s fantasy or defensive or denial from grown-ups to say: ‘Can the kids just please be allowed to be kids? Can’t they have their childhood and not have to worry about this stuff until maybe they have actual agency in their lives?’ Instead of being in tears at age 10, don’t they deserve their innocence, their chance to not have to worry? Gameau said the crying 10-year-old in the film was actually frustrated by cleaning up beach plastic every weekend “and no one in her government or community is giving a shit like she does and she doesn’t understand”. (Gameau did not mention the film’s other kids who were depressed and pessimistic about a planetary apocalypse foisted on them by the climate crowd). Gameau said he still speaks to the kids most weeks and they’re all doing well. None are obsessed with trying to fix the planet themselves. They’ve got lots of other interests. “But I’m with you. I think, gosh, it’d be great if kids didn’t have to go through this.” Joyce: But my heart breaks for Skye [Welsh, about 12], who is so angry. At her age, doesn’t she deserve to not have that anger? Gameau: Yeah, you’re right. She does. But she’s in a village, Fairbourne, that’s about to go under the water – the first one in the Western world because of climate.” He said it’s so real to her because she’s losing her home and getting fire in her belly over it. “We can’t ask her just to stop because she’s fighting for something bigger than we understand. (Fairbourne’s watery grave by 2050 is just more worst-case climate baloney dished out by a green-left town council scared of lawsuits, and contrary to views of eminent scientists in those parts. Don’t take my word for it, it’s all spelt out in the local Cambrian News.) Joyce: But when [Qld-born eco-activist] Clover Hogan tells the kids “eco-anxiety is a really healthy response” – that stabbed me. Is it healthy for a 10-year-old? Gameau: If you’re not feeling some kind of emotion, where are you at? How disconnected are you actually with the living world? Let’s have a proper conversation because children are feeling things more deeply than maybe a few more adults should be. Joyce: There’s an impulse to say ‘Just leave the kids alone, let them be kids, stop turning them all into Greta Thunberg’. I think we’d prefer for our kids to be like the boy from Norfolk Island [called Hiva] who just cherishes birds and wants to take photos of them. Gameau: The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. So, perhaps the Greta [Thunberg] bolshie approach isn’t actually the only way to do this… We have to do things differently.As for the film itself, it opens with a glum Joaquin (from Holland), who looks about 12-14. He was born deaf but after a Cochlear implant can now speak several languages. He says, “I just hear nothing else, like complete death. When I think about the future, it’s not good. Yeah, it’s looking pretty dark. Companies not even trying to care about the planet. You know, I’m trying to live here too.” Whichever adults dumped their climate paranoia on this kid should examine their consciences. Gameau: Why do you all think that we’ve started this trip in a forest? Joaquin: So we can see what would be lost if humanity continues like this. Gameau: Very good answer. Soon after, Aurvi, 11, from Singapore, says she wouldn’t even in her thoughts think of hurting someone. But she visited the Great Barrier Reef and all the beautiful corals and fish and turtles could one day be gone. (Again, climate zealots have blighted her joy by doom-mongering about the Reef. Just last month the Institute of Marine Science’s annual reef data showed coral cover at record highs for the past several years, recently returning to about the 40-year average – despite six supposedly cataclysmic bleachings in the past decade).[2] Skye from Wales wrote to nature guru David Attenborough: I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood. As mentioned, this derives just from town councillors and activists doom-crying on their concocted worse-case scenarios. Bird-loving boy Hiva from Norfolk Island seems as dejected as Skye. He says birds are the ambassadors for wild places. Then he found out about critically endangered, vulnerable birds. “I could bring back a book in 30 years’ time about the extinct birds of the world and then I could have to write a sad introduction about all the things that people have done. I love them so much and I want them to be here no matter what.” He would try to see less money going to the companies that destroy and really hurt birds. The omission here is what suggests Gameau’s film is indoctrination not education. Why does Gameau not draw attention to the raptor-mincing ways of the wind turbines that he’d love to see dotting entire landscapes? There’s no wind turbines (yet) on Hiva’s Norfolk Island, but surely the kids on the bus notice a few during their trip through eight countries, and raise the bird issue? Ruby Rodgers, from NSW, is the granddaughter of rocker Jimmy Barnes and her singing is often on the film’s soundtrack. She says, “How we are treating the planet right now, and humanity, is quite scary.” Lines in the soundtrack from her songs include, “How can you tell me to keep on breathing? Tell me to keep believing while my home is being torn apart? Try not to give up, try to make a stand, ‘Coz I feel my future, Slippin’ from my hands.”Gameau’s film wheels out “experts” to calm the kids’ fears, like North-Queensland-born UK climate activist and Al Gore disciple Clover Hogan, now 24. At 16 she attended the UN’s Paris climate conference and at 19 she set up her “Force of Nature” entity to ally youngsters with decision-makers and jointly tackle the “climate deniers”.[3] Via google I find she touts the gamut of green-left causes like anti-capitalism and open borders. To Hogan, a UK government decision to open 42 new oilfields is “a death sentence” for her generation. And she wants the media to stop asking mean questions about activists’ “hypocritical” air travel, and instead “challenge the rich and powerful”. In the film one of the girls, about 14, asks her, “Like I’m not doing as much as everyone else and I just feel like there is so much pressure. It’s like, ‘Be doing more!’” But she doesn’t know what to do, and her voice cracks with emotion. Clover tells her she is already doing so much. The sadness, anger, frustration is the internal alarm bell that something is really wrong, although people in power try to numb such feelings. “So eco-anxiety is a really healthy response, right? It is evidence that you care.” Hogan thus calms the girl, who wipes away a tear. Marketing the film, Gameau over-sells how the kids confront corporate chiefs, because the only big companies that agreed to be censured by sub-teen greenies were Nestle and ING Bank, plus an online session with sportwear’s Decathlon. ING was in the tent already, having banned lending to coal companies and similar CO2 villains. The others, especially Coca-Cola and Pepsi, wisely turned down this alleged opportunity. Note that Gameau’s film continually mixes up the valid case against plastic litter, with net-zero agitation and foolish denunciation of “plastics” per se, vital ingredients of modern living. Given the kids’ scripted questions, the execs were on a hiding to nothing: ♦ When your grandchildren grow up, do you think they’ll be proud that you helped finance global pollution? ♦ Why not try to sacrifice a tiny bit of the profits in exchange for long-term sustainability? ♦ What are you and your foundation doing to ensure climate justice? ♦ What would you prefer: to have a greener future, or to have a future that still has fossil fuels and bad gasses? I don’t want to knock any kid’s sincerity and passion but it’s Gameau, not me, setting them up for crusading to classrooms. And the kids’ parent or guardian who came along for the ride were fine with their kids fronting Gameau’s polemic. The kids’ tussle with Nestle’s PR global chief Rob Cameron in Switzerland is the film’s climax, supposedly illustrating Gameau’s “Future Council” of wise and righteous adolescents. I can see how Nestle’s Cameron got seduced in. He’s been a green activist for 25 years and joined Nestle in 2020 from his CEO and managing partner role at global think tank SustainAbility. He runs Nestle’s ESG (‘environment, social, governance’) efforts and helps run its Net Zero Roadmap. About the time when Gameau’s troop monstered him, he became chair of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Global Commission on Environment and Energy. The kids, doubtless geed-up by their adults, saw him as the culprit for plastic litter. Relaxed in his open-neck sky-blue shirt, he tried to explain that without high-tech packaging, Nestle foods would degrade, especially ageing on small-shop shelves in the tropics. He hinted that green-friendly packs might let in human-unfriendly bugs. Skye from Wales, congratulated later by Gameau for her ‘bad-ass’ speeches, was having have none of it. Channelling Greta Thunberg’s ‘How dare you!’, she read from her script: I sat in front of a powerful leader and listened to your empty words and empty promises. Plastic is everywhere. It’s in our seas and our rivers, on our beaches and mountains, in our food and even in our blood. They proudly tell us that Smarties can be a completely sustainable paper tube, whilst you churn out over five billion plastic wrapped KitKats every single year. You’re the third biggest polluter on the planet. You are not a powerful leader. You are a disgrace. She finished with a Thunberg-like glower and then a little grin, while Gameau’s score swells and he inserts a clip of Skye collecting plastic litter to show she’s a good kid. Serves silly Cameron right for trusting the movie project in the first place. The lamestream-media reviews rhapsodise about Skye leaving Cameron “speechless”. In fact he recovered swiftly from brat-attack and his response was a model of kindness: Sorry you think that. Truly. You’re right that the company has a lot of impact. And when it comes to great responsibility, I and other folk in the business all care passionately about the world we live in. I’m a father. We love our children. I don’t want to leave a [worse] world that my daughter grows up in. Companies [should] operate in an economy that knows its place within the wider ecosystem, we just lost sight of that. Not all the film’s humour seems intentional – one of the boys says, “A lot of the time kids aren’t listened to by adults. I’ve had some really good ideas for them. It was more about my bedroom, but…” Future Council , although days old, has already aged badly. The Net Zero quest is collapsing.[4] China, India and the US have opted out and Western Europe is convulsed with doubts, not that teachers would ever let kids know. Once-green asset managers like BlackRock ($US10 trillion) and Vanguard ($US9 trillion) have quit the Net Zero club to realign with fossil fuels. BP has ditched the revised branding and renewables theme from 2000, namely “Beyond Petroleum”. The re-brand supported renewables but has trashed BP’s share price. Facts and brainwashing aside, Gameau’s movie has plenty of charm with its exuberant storyline, family-friendly antics and great production values. Gameau has even allocated 75% of his producer’s profit share to the Future Council concept. For all that, the movie has arisen from the ideological swamp to the left of the Greens, as evident in Gameau’s political musings on his Instagram posts. When (not if) this movie invades classrooms, conservative parents need to start their own climate protesting. Tony Thomas’s latest book, Anthem of the Unwoke – Yep the other lot’s gone bonkers is available from Connor Court, $34.95 [1] Jason Kimberley of the Craig Kimberley rich-list family launched Cool in 2008. [2] AIMS for alarmism’s sake takes pains not to show the GBR’s total recent coral cover, instead splitting it into separate graphs for the northern, central and southern reefs. Dr Peter Ridd has simply combined the data as shown here to reveal the reef’s true health. [3] Clover Hogan was shocked to be invited to discuss “climate science” on a TV show, but “sharing the segment with a climate denier.” She upbraided the producer, who replied that since people like President Trump denied the science, the media had to reflect all views. Clover’s view was that the media should tell only “the truth” – adding, “Lives, policies, and the future of the planet depend on it.” [4] As the International Energy Agency puts it, “Despite efforts to reduce these emissions, the trajectory of CO2 emissions globally remains far higher than what is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

But we do have “Freedom of Speech” which allows you to say stupid (but not intentionally harmful) things. (I’m looking at you Al Gore and Micky Mann.) I will argue what Al Gore is preaching is religion, not science. I also posted a negative comment about AG in this thread. Inconvenient truth etc are truly shameful. But man, what a great growly oratory voice he has. Gore failed out of divinity school. But he does have that camp meeting aura. If I can’t cast (rhetorical) stones at evil, then how will the good be defended? Hey teacher! Leave those kids alone! The trouble is, they’re not just another brick in their walls, more of an RSJ… My thought exactly!! Thank goodness I grew up before climate even existed. The first I heard of climate in the classroom was when I was in college. Then it was that we were heading into an ice age. Ah, for the good old days. My indoctrination was a luncheon speech in 2021 to a group of us retired managers by an Emeritus polymath professor from the University of Rochester, who to keep busy in his retirement was helping his friend Richard Lindzen of MIT analyze data concerning the alleged Global Warming crisis. Without going into any detail, what got me hooked was his clear demonstration of the logic chain (with probabilities) you would have to accept in order to believe we were facing a crisis. My next steps were WUWT and Bishop Hill. No turning back after that. Bishop Hill? WUWT? Bishop Hill – long dead UK sceptic blog WUWT – abbreviation for… look at the top of the page, If you want to get some real info to chew on, try Steve McIntyre’s “Climate Audit” blog. He was upfront and center during the Climategate scandals. It’s astounding. College students were required to read “Population Bomb” when it came out. Again… environmental science and ecology majors should be required to read the original edition _today_. Lots of YouTube videos now about the horror of population collapse. That, and the horror of AI destroying all middle class jobs. Apparently, people always need something to fear and that allows grifters to exploit that potential for fear. The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. There are “some,” he says. Yes, and there are some who use their children as props for their own politics. Hopefully these children will gain balanced and productive thinking from mentors they will have later in life. For others it will be too little too late probably. Or they will find mentors who make things worse. I think real data will confirm that there are a LOT of “good humans” who “care about the planet” while rejecting the assumptions and solutions alarmist preach. What I don’t understand is that most people don’t realize that if you accept someone’s false (and undefined) PREMISE on faith, they then can get you to accept any ridiculous CONCLUSION. ...”live in a polluted world” – what pollution, and once you define what “pollution” you are talking about, where do I go for data to confirm your allegation?!? Until then, stop preaching about solutions to your imaginary problems. (I’m too busy preparing for the imminent invasion of leprechauns to the US!) “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” – Voltaire This is child abuse. Nothing less. You took the words right out of my mouth Useful idiots doing the Marxists bidding. The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. “Conspiracy theory”? Bit by bit, inch by inch, they are introducing their ideology without showing their faces. Do they even teach anymore that without CO2 we wouldn’t have any plants growing and producing food to eat and oxygen for us to breath? The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. __________________________________________________________________________ NOW?? They’ve been at for as long as I can remember, and I have a 1944 DOB. Yup. I can attest that the process started before USA HS class of 1992. I was wondering … will this turn out to be a product by a raging alcoholic’s fever dream like the 2004 movie by Morgan Spurlock who turned out a docudrama called “Super Size Me” wherein practically everything in the movie was/is a lie? Notable are the comments (in the video below) from people (kids in school at the time) who saw Super Size Me at their schools (in 2004) and called out their teachers for the ridiculous premise Spurlock based the film on -the over eating of jumbo portions of fast food- and the effects on his body which INCLUDED (but not revealed in the film) his alcoholism (which was only admitted-to years later by Spurlock.) Kids are not always so easily fooled it seems. Maybe that will happen with this effort too (a revelation years after the film is out and the kids will toss out the premise.) Supersize Me: How Documentaries Lie But, but, but… You can’t be saying that someone as altruistic as Al Gore would lie to us, can you…? The smart ones will “get it”. They have instilled indoctrination into the schools crowding out some of the needed reading, writing, arithmetic studies. It is a nation in decline. I wonder if this Gameau dude is going to take his act to Chinese schools, noting that they are the biggest emitter? I suspect not. I think in almost all countries where there is an education establishment, it’s leftist. And although the left does not believe in God, they have taken at least some of the wisdom in the Bible to heart, applying propaganda and indoctrination from an early age: Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. — Proverbs 22:6 Not sure what you mean by leftist, but in western countries the educational establishment was the Church. And, following the French example, the reaction to the Church was the alternative educational establishment. As the State and RC Churches are defenders of orthodoxy, conservative power structures and the Establishment, the alternative has been leftist. Because they are the reaction to reactionary forces. The thing to do is mount an organization to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. Adults who lie to kids for their own self-serving feelings of virtue. Net Zero as an expression of defective personalities. The whole green thing is clearly powered by character assassination. Time to do some character assassination right back. HEAR HEAR! to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. They’re already predisposed to think that, might actually accomplish something! “…dark-green activist Damon Gameau.” A good fit for the title role — Here follows a marvellous wonder, which transpired in the town of Hamelin in the diocese of Minden, in this Year of Our Lord, 1284, on the Feast of Saints John and Paul. A certain young man thirty years of age, handsome and well-dressed, so that all who saw him admired him because of his appearance, crossed the bridges and entered the town by the West Gate. He then began to play all through the town a silver pipe of the most magnificent sort. All the children who heard his pipe, in the number of 130, followed him to the East Gate and out of the town to the so-called execution place or Calvary. There they proceeded to vanish, so that no trace of them could be found. The mothers of the children ran from town to town, but they found nothing. It is written: A voice was heard from on high, and a mother was bewailing her son. And as one counts the years according to the Year of Our Lord or according to the first, second or third year of an anniversary, so do the people in Hamelin reckon the years after the departure and disappearance of their children. This report I found in an old book. And the mother of the Dean Johann von Lüde saw the children depart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin TL;DR Learn to read faster. “The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner.” 2040-2025 = 15 years “The average retirement age for Australian teachers is around 65 years old, according to NGS Super” If I were king of Australia I would demand that any teacher who shows this movie before 2030 must also show the same, unupdated, unedited film after 2040 lest their retirement funds become void. The second biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth was its popularity as USA science class filler the year it was released. The first biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth is that it is not shown in the same classes today in unupdated, unedited form – the smart kids will “get it”. I believe it is a UK requirement that that piece of rubbish can only be shown in schools if preceded by a clear statement that everything in that film has been proven false. I agree wholeheartedly that we should embrace First Nations wisdom, especially that of the European First Nations who ushered in the age of enlightenment and allow humanity to grow out of superstitious belief systems empowering humanity to grow, nurture and shepherd the planet to support ~10 Billion humans and incredible biodiversity that exists. So, lets embrace the wisdom of the European First Nations people(s). Well expressed and dead on. Three full cheers for the Enlightenment! The problem, on all sides of all political debates, is that there is no risk management. In the real world, wherever accountable decisions are made, every choice must also consider what happens if the decision is not made or if it is made… and goes wrong. The probabilities are assessed and justified, the mitigating precautions are put in place (considering costs relative to the probabilities). And then, only then, is the decision made. In politics, the decision is made assuming that they have the absolute truth of the world; now, yesterday and forever. (Theologically speaking, this is warned against in the 1st Commandment. There is a reason it’s the very 1st one). “I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood.” No, Fairbourne is built on the medieval seabed. The A493 road follows the original coastline approximately 10m above high-water mark. The land now occupied by the village of Fairbourne, now in the county of Gwynedd but once part of the historic county of Merioneth, was until the mid 1800’s nothing more than a mixture of open rough grazing and salt marsh. The church & hotel occupy the only stable ground in Fairbourne, a holiday village built in the 1860s enabled by the coming of the railway. The land that comprises Fairbourne and lower Friog was formed by glacial deposits and built up sand deposited by tidal action. This ‘Northwards Longshore Drift’ over thousands of years built up the shingle bank that stretched from the Friog cliffs in the South across the front of Fairbourne, ending in a sand spit opposite Abermaw (Barmouth) on the shores of the Mawddach estuary. These same tidal conditions regularly shift stone and sand around and are responsible in part for the silting up of Abermaw (Barmouth) harbour and the mouth of the Mawddach. Further up the coast, Harlech Castle (1288), was built on the coast with a dock for supplies. Since then, Northwards ‘Longshore Drift’ has moved the coast ~ 1kM to the west ( a lot of the material coming up from Fairbourne). Harlech railway station is built on the old seabed next to the (now dry) castle dock, and like at Fairborne, the A493 road follows the original coastline. Here endeth the lesson (:-)) Error, … plus pics “and like at Fairborne, the A493 B4573 road follows the original coastline.” Sorry (:-(( Picture shows Harlech Castle dock at the rail/road crossing (bottom left) & the old coastline curving away (mid right). &f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d4701f35aebcd5ac7d5d3f5de9b9c73bab8aebfca41a7bd374a57c62e3478704 *** Fairborne, the old coastline is at the dark tree line, other side of the railway embankment. https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%2Fid%2FOIP.KrYS0ztadqsY4jKRn_11ywHaEI%3Fr%3D0%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=0ce68450207e4d5a6f0775bd81ac777d4592776123ceac52f226e5cb8fbbc733 Being taught what to think though emotionalism.

Title: OpenAI Crosses $12 Billion ARR: The 3-Year Sprint That Redefined What’s Possible in Scaling Software

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai, Scale OpenAI just announced it hit its first $1 billion revenue month in July 2025, representing a staggering acceleration from $500 million monthly at the start of the year—a stunning 100% increase in just seven months. We’ve never seen anything like this. And … it’s accelerating. (As is Anthropic at $5B ARR). Here’s how OpenAI’s timeline compares to other tech titans: OpenAI (2022-2025): ~3 years Google/Alphabet (1998-2006): ~8 years Meta/Facebook (2004-2012): ~8 years Netflix (1997-2018): ~21 years Infrastructure-First Scaling: Unlike previous tech giants that built infrastructure as they grew, OpenAI requires massive compute infrastructure upfront, creating a unique scaling challenge and competitive moat. Multi-Modal Revenue Model: OpenAI achieved $12B ARR through multiple revenue streams simultaneously—consumer subscriptions, enterprise solutions, and API access—rather than the single-channel focus of early Google (search ads) or Facebook (social ads). Enterprise Adoption Speed: The company announced earlier this month that it has three million paying business users, up from the two million it reported in February, representing 50% growth in just a few months—faster B2B adoption than any previous consumer-to-enterprise crossover. AI-Native Architecture: Every dollar of OpenAI’s revenue is built on foundation models, making it the first major tech company to achieve this scale purely through artificial intelligence, unlike companies that added AI to existing products. OpenAI’s financial trajectory in 2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary. The company has hit $12 billion in annual recurring revenue, with revenue doubling during the first seven months of 2025. To put this in perspective: This represents a 3,628x increase since 2020, when OpenAI generated just $3.5 million in revenue. Having already hit $12 billion ARR by July 2025, the company is now on track to reach $15-20 billion in annual recurring revenue by year-end, significantly exceeding the original $12.7 billion projection made earlier in the year. OpenAI’s revenue streams have evolved into a sophisticated multi-tier model: Consumer Subscriptions (55-60% of revenue): Enterprise Solutions (25-30% of revenue): API and Developer Platform (15-20% of revenue): Despite the revenue celebration, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar revealed the company is “constantly under compute” and faces ongoing pressures from AI compute demands. This isn’t just a temporary bottleneck—it’s becoming the defining constraint for the entire AI industry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently announced that the company is “out of GPUs,” delaying the broader rollout of GPT-4.5. The new model requires: This compute shortage isn’t unique to OpenAI—it’s symptomatic of an industry-wide crisis where AI data centers could require the power equivalent of an entire city by 2030. OpenAI’s response has been audacious: The Stargate Project, a new company investing $500 billion over four years to build new AI infrastructure in the United States. Key details: However, critics question the feasibility of Stargate, highlighting funding concerns where only $45 billion has been secured of the $100 billion commitment, leaving a significant gap. OpenAI maintains a commanding position in the AI landscape, but the competitive dynamics are shifting rapidly across both enterprise and consumer segments. OpenAI’s enterprise position varies significantly across different AI categories: The consumer AI assistant market has crystallized into a competitive landscape dominated by three primary players, each carving out distinct positioning: ChatGPT: The Incumbent Leader ChatGPT maintains its position as the market leader with the largest user base, though growth has eased as competitors have improved their offerings. Key consumer metrics include: Perplexity: The Research-Focused Challenger Perplexity has successfully challenged established players by gaining users in segments overlooked by OpenAI’s ChatGPT and compelling Google to respond to its innovations in search and mobile. Consumer growth metrics show impressive momentum: Claude: The Quality-Focused Alternative Anthropic’s Claude chatbot has the smallest user base of the big four, with usage primarily through API partners and enterprise platforms rather than mass consumer adoption. Consumer positioning characteristics: The consumer market shows several distinct usage patterns: Specialized Use Cases Drive Loyalty Platform Integration Success Perplexity’s boldest distribution move involved integrating directly into mobile devices, announcing a partnership with Motorola for pre-installation on new smartphones, challenging Google’s position as default AI assistant. The company is also negotiating with Samsung for similar integration. Multi-Tool Strategy Emergence Heavy AI users increasingly want access to both tools due to rate limits and different pricing tiers for specific use cases, using Claude for in-depth writing while using ChatGPT for quick searches and image generation. The AI competitive landscape has become increasingly dynamic in 2025: Rising Competitors: Enterprise Adoption Patterns: When moving to a new LLM, organizations most commonly cite security and safety considerations (46%), price (44%), performance (42%), and expanded capabilities (41%) as motivations. OpenAI’s valuation trajectory tells the story of AI’s explosive market potential: The proposed $500 billion valuation would make OpenAI one of approximately 20 companies in the world valued at or above this threshold, joining Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. OpenAI has become a funding juggernaut: Despite explosive revenue growth, OpenAI faces significant profitability challenges: The economics are brutal: OpenAI is pursuing multiple strategies to reduce dependence on external providers: Custom Silicon Development: Cloud Diversification: The AI talent war has intensified: OpenAI’s aggressive growth targets have been repeatedly exceeded: OpenAI’s success has broader implications: OpenAI’s journey to $1 billion monthly revenue represents more than a financial milestone—it’s definitive proof that the AI revolution has moved from experimental to essential. However, the company’s “constantly under compute” challenge reveals that success in AI requires not just great technology, but infrastructure investments at a scale the tech industry has never seen. The pace of change is breathtaking: what took Google and Facebook 8 years and Netflix over two decades, OpenAI achieved in roughly 3 years. But this acceleration comes with a new constraint—the physical limits of GPU manufacturing and power generation that will determine which companies can sustain AI leadership.

Title: Meta wants to speed its race to ‘superintelligence’ — but investors will still want their billions in ad revenue
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/20/meta-ai-race-superintelligence-investors-billions-in-ad-revenue/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T20:01:23Z
Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Meta is doubling down on its so-called race to “superintelligence,” reshuffling its AI organization once more as its new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) group takes shape. But analysts say investors are keeping their eye on the prize Meta has always promised: improved products that increase engagement and, in turn, sell more ads. Superintelligent AI models, if they arrive, are just a means to that end. This time it’s former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang—brought on by Mark Zuckerberg in June as chief AI officer—leading the reorganization. Wang, who now oversees a sprawling operation of thousands of engineers, scientists, and product managers, is looking to rein it in, reportedly resulting in some expected executive departures and at least one team shutdown. Wang was hired to help recruit a small, high-priced cadre of researchers—some reportedly offered compensation packages exceeding $100 million, typically spread out over several years—now perched at the pinnacle of Meta’s AI effort. But that group is only the tip of the spear: The new restructuring folds the entire AI organization into MSL, with four new groups focused on research, training, products, and infrastructure, all part of a bid for speed. The quartet of group leaders will all report to Wang, including well-known investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who will lead product and applied research, and former OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, who will lead the research team as chief scientist. In a recent email to employees, which detailed the restructuring, Wang acknowledged that reorganizations can be disruptive but insisted the new structure would “allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term.” (Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request to confirm the contents of the email, which were published by Business Insider.) Investors, meanwhile, seem to have mixed feelings: Meta’s stock slid more than 2% on the news today, but climbed most of the way back by market close. The share-price slide also reflects broader market jitters, as overheated AI and Big Tech names come off recent highs, said Daniel Newman, CEO of research firm the Futurum Group. He said he expects a “modest correction” but noted that Meta has “had an incredible run” and recently “delivered a great quarter once again.” Still, analysts are eyeing Zuckerberg’s nine-figure paydays for top AI researchers and his repeated reorganizing, and watching for signs that Meta will close the gap in the AI race. “Of course there is some concern,” Newman said, pointing out that numerous frontier models from OpenAI, xAI, and Google continue to improve, while Meta’s open-source Llama models have “seemingly stalled.” “We think the team at Meta, after Zuckerberg’s hiring spree, will need a period of acclimation before it finds the velocity to develop more competitive solutions,” he said. That need for speed, however, is best understood as an extension of Meta’s product machine rather than a bid to solve humanity’s greatest challenges. While Meta has dabbled in moonshot AI through its FAIR research lab (cofounded by chief scientist Yann LeCun), rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic and spinoffs such as Thinking Machines Lab and Safe Superintelligence have made the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AI generally defined to be as smart as humans) and superintelligence (AI far smarter than humans) their central mission.Meta’s mission, by contrast, has remained the same as it was before “superintelligence” became a buzzword: improving the products that power engagement on its massively profitable social-media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The advertising on those platforms is the source of nearly all of Meta’s revenue, which reached $46.6 billion in the most recent quarter. Zuckerberg underscored this focus last month with an Instagram Reel and blog post in which he said AI is rapidly advancing and that we’re beginning to see “glimpses of AI systems improving themselves.” Superintelligence is now “in sight,” he added—but while rival AI companies talk about scientific or economic breakthroughs, his vision is aimed squarely at the individual: a personalized AI that helps you “achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, be a better friend, and grow to become the person that you aspire to be.” That framing neatly aligns with what Meta has always built—consumer-facing experiences designed to keep people engaged (and sell more ads). To Zuckerberg, superintelligence also means powering the future of AI-infused personal devices, specifically augmented-reality glasses that can “see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day.” Newman said he continues to like Meta’s prospects because the company “isn’t as dependent on the research end of its business, as it is using AI to continue to create higher daily active user numbers—and of course, the coinciding revenue continues to rise as well.” But Forrester’s Mike Proulx countered that there is no doubt Meta is laser-focused on building “the best and most powerful AI models, period,” he told Fortune. “The race is on, and Meta is lagging against competitors. A concerted focus on superintelligence gives Meta a North Star to rally around both strategically and operationally.” Zuckerberg echoed that sentiment on Meta’s most recent earnings call, stressing that AI is at the center of each of Meta’s five focus areas. But Proulx pointed out that it was AI glasses—not the company’s family of apps—that Zuckerberg highlighted on that call as “the main way” superintelligence will enter people’s daily lives. Overall, Proulx said he is not concerned with the seemingly constant upheaval in Meta’s AI organization. “This space is moving at breakneck speed. As with any emerging tech race, there’s inevitably going to be a lot of pivoting. It comes with the territory,” he said. For all the lofty talk of superintelligence, however, Meta’s AI reshuffling shows its bets are mostly still the same: personalized products that keep billions scrolling, ads flowing—and soon, AI-powered glasses perched on every face. How the company fares will be closely watched: “The question now is whether the team is effectively enabled to deliver, or not,” said Proulx. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Potential Tailwinds Blowing For This Aerospace Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/20/potential-tailwinds-blowing-for-this-aerospace-stock/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T19:33:12Z

BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Aerospace and defense stock Rocket Lab Corp (RKLB) has been chopping lower since its July 17 record high of $53.44. The stock could be ready for a short-term pop, however, as the recent pullback has it flashing a historically bullish signal. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, RKLB is within 0.75 of the 50-day trendline's 20-day average true range (ATR), after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days and 80% of the last two months above it. Over the past three years, six similar signals have occurred, after which the equity was higher one month later 67% of the time, averaging a 13.9% gain. A move of similar magnitude from the stock's current perch of $40.16 would put it at $45.74, much closer to its recent peak. RKLB’s 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 19.98 sits firmly in "oversold" territory, which typically precedes a short-term bounce. Furthermore, short interest currently represents 11.3% of the stock's available float, leaving plenty for a short covering potential. An unwinding of pessimism amongst options traders could provide tailwinds as well. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), Rocket Lab stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.98 ranks higher than 98% of readings from the past year. So while calls are still winning out on an absolute basis, put traders have been chiming in at a much faster-than-usual rate.

Title: 5 bold crypto predictions for 2026
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/5-bold-crypto-predictions-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T19:00:55Z
Full Content:
From Bitcoin milestones to DeFi growth, here are five bold predictions outlining crypto’s possible trajectory in 2026. Bitcoin could approach $198K, Ripple nears a $125 million settlement, and Ethereum eyes $15K. Memecoin ETFs loom and DeFi adoption accelerates, making 2026 a pivotal year across multiple sectors. In 2025, crypto markets exploded, with total market cap exceeding $4 trillion. Despite economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and regulatory concerns, crypto proved more entrenched than ever. Over the past seven months, institutional demand for cryptocurrency surged. Bitcoin [BTC] stabilized above $100k. Moreover, crypto-friendly policies and regulatory frameworks slowly emerged in the U.S. since the Election of Donald Trump. But what should we expect in 2026? Since dropping to a low of $74k four months ago, Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high of $124,517. It stabilized above $100k and has held it for over 60 days. Significantly, this uptrend was fueled by institutional demand and capital inflows through ETFs. Bitcoin’s Spot ETFs’ Total Net Assets hit approximately $150 billion, indicating massive demand. Source: CoinGlass Amid steady inflows, Bitcoin’s bull cycle may prove extended and exhausting. In such a case, based on the long-term power law, Bitcoin might reach $130k in September 2025 and close the year at $141.9k. Source: Bitbo In 2026, if institutional demand remains constant and macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, Bitcoin could peak at $198k. In the most bullish scenario, if BTC continues to rise at the same rate as it has over the past year, it might reach $211k. Ripple [XRP] became the breakout altcoin of 2025. Over the year, XRP soared ~620%, climbing from $0.50 to $3.60. Having said that, the surge was linked to U.S. regulatory shifts. Since 2018, the SEC had waged war on Ripple, eroding investor confidence. Source: X Now, with policy changes, Ripple’s battles appear near conclusion. Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC would drop its case, while Ripple agreed to pay a $125 million fine after Judge Torres rejected a $50 million reduction. This resolution sets a precedent for future crypto cases and opens doors for institutional adoption, especially in cross-border settlement. If $5 breaks in 2025, XRP could rally toward $10 in 2026. While Bitcoin and XRP rallied at the start of 2025, Ethereum [ETH] plummeted, especially over Vitalik Buterin’s political stands. Yet institutions, whales, and ETFs returned strongly in recent months. At press time, Spot ETH ETFs managed ~$22 billion in assets. Also, ETH has become an institution’s favorite with Bitmine, Sharplink, and BlackRock aggressively accumulating it. In this case, we expect institutions and ETFs to push Ethereum to rally into a new all-time high. As such, ETH could retest $5K in September, climb to $8K by year-end, and average $9K–$10K through 2026. A cycle peak near $15K remains possible. This price uptick will be primarily driven by upgraded network and staking scarcity. As such, we expect the layer 2s of Ethereum to improve transactions and reduce costs, thereby making the blockchain dominant. Memecoins, especially Dogecoin [DOGE], have had a dismal performance in 2025 so far. The Official Trump [TRUMP] hype quickly dissipated once it emerged. This is because capital has massively rotated to Bitcoin, XRP and ETH. However, this doesn’t mean all is lost. Like other coins, market players have pushed for a memecoin ETF. As such, Grayscale and Bitwise applied for Dogecoin ETFs, while Canary Capital applied for Pudgy Penguins [PENGU] ETFs. In 2026, approval of a Dogecoin ETF or another memecoin could trigger fresh speculative frenzy. Amid a growing cryptocurrency market, adoption and growing support from major economies such as the United States, DeFi becomes closer to the everyday consumer. For that reason, it’s natural to expect traditional CeFi pools to integrate with DeFi, expanding borrowing, lending, and yield functionalities. Source: Grandview Therefore, in 2026, we expect the DeFi market to grow from its current $21 billion and surpass $30 billion. This will push the long-term projection towards $231 billion into reality as DeFi integrates growing AI. Looking at previous cycles, the crypto market continued to grow over the past decade with minimal drawdowns. Now, with a $4T market cap, crypto stands among the world’s top asset classes. And in 2026, the growth will continue not only for Bitcoin, but also for other altcoins and the broader blockchain ecosystems. As a result, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies will most likely reach $5 trillion and flip, becoming among the top global economies.

Title: Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin as best-performing asset over next decade

Time Published: 2025-08-20T18:42:46Z

Bitwise Asset Management expects bitcoin to deliver the strongest returns of any major asset class over the next ten years, projecting a compound annual growth rate of 28% with gradually declining volatility. The forecast was shared in a new memo previewing the firm’s forthcoming Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report. The report, authored by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, is targeted at large platforms and professional allocators that are increasingly treating bitcoin as a “core” portfolio consideration. Hougan notes that the shift follows the launch and widespread approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have opened the asset class to mainstream retirement accounts and wealth platforms. Interest in long-term planning has grown markedly. Hougan said Bitwise received a dozen requests this year for long-term assumptions around bitcoin, compared with none between 2017 and 2024. In his view, this marks an inflection point: institutions are now evaluating bitcoin in the same way they assess equities, bonds, and other traditional assets. While the full report is yet to be published, the preview states that bitcoin’s projected returns, volatility profile, and correlations compare favourably with established asset classes. Bitwise characterises bitcoin’s correlations with other major assets as “low”, falling between −0.5 and 0.5, which many allocators value for diversification benefits. The asset manager’s positioning of bitcoin’s outlook draws parallels with annual capital-market forecasts issued by large Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan, PIMCO, BlackRock, and Vanguard. These outlooks help institutions determine long-term strategic allocations across asset classes including equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternatives. Hougan argues that similar guidance is now warranted for digital assets, given their growing maturity and integration into mainstream investment products. Since spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, they have quickly gained traction. On-chain holdings tied to these ETFs have grown to represent almost 7% of bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply, with assets under management exceeding $146 billion, according to data from The Block. Corporate treasuries have also expanded their exposure. Publicly traded companies, led by MicroStrategy with a holding of 629,376 BTC, have collectively accumulated more than $80 billion worth of bitcoin. These acquisitions have been financed largely through capital market activities, including equity offerings and convertible debt issuance. Bitwise’s full Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report is expected later this week. It will provide detailed methodology and quantitative analysis, alongside side-by-side comparisons with forecasts for traditional asset classes from leading global asset managers. For Bitwise, the release marks a bid to position bitcoin within the same framework used for decades to evaluate traditional investments. For institutions, it reflects a growing acceptance of bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a serious allocation option with defined risk and return expectations.

Title: Liberty Steel: UK government prepares to take over plant

The government is preparing to take control of the UK's third largest steelworks in a bid to save the business and protect 1,500 jobs. Managers have been lined up to take over Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) in South Yorkshire which is owned by Liberty Steel, a court heard. The future of the company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, has been uncertain for some time and it could be wound up over its large pile of unpaid debts. It comes after ministers seized control of British Steel, in Scunthorpe, earlier this year to prevent the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel from closing. SSUK is home to the UK's largest electric arc furnace which are more energy efficient and are thought to be pivotal in the industry's energy transition. But the company has faced financial troubles for sometime and has been unable to buy the scrap metal needed to produce steel after Liberty Steel's main lender collapsed and unpaid debts mounted. A High Court judge is set to decide the fate of SSUK. Liberty Steel mill 'basically derelict' - worker Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Sheffield under threat Lawyers for Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of GFG Alliance which owns Liberty, warned that a winding up order could mean the end of steel production at the plant. They sought an adjournment to allow him to complete an administration process for the company to then be sold, without the need for any government intervention. But lawyers for the creditors produced a letter to the court from the government offering reassurance that it would step in to take over the steelworks if required. Creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds petitioned a court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty Steel's assets can be sold to pay the debts owed. Mr Gupta, whose firm owns a collection of businesses in energy, trading and steel, employing thousands of people in the UK, has faced scrutiny since GFG's main lender Greensill Capital collapsed in 2021. Sources close to the steel tycoon have confirmed reports that negotiations with investment giant Blackrock were ongoing to provide new funding to buy the business out of a managed or "pre-pack" administration. The judge on Tuesday expressed reservations saying there was no certainty as to what would happen to the company after the compulsory liquidation the creditors were demanding. "What happens to trading after the magic words are uttered?" the judge asked, referring to the formal granting of a winding up petition. "There is simply too much at stake." The case has been adjourned and referred to the High Court. While the government is a supporter of steel, it is not a big fan of Mr Gupta and has rejected his repeated appeals for direct government support. So the choice now is an unappealing one. Allow Mr Gupta to try and keep control though an administration â at considerable cost to the lenders whose loans would be largely written off - but zero cost to the government. Or help his creditors recover what is left of their money by taking on a loss-making steel plant for however long it takes for a buyer to be found and the sale proceeds dished out. The government said it would "continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company". "We are supporting the Official Receiver so that they are prepared to take the necessary steps should the company enter into compulsory liquidation," a statement said. Liberty Steel said it believed its "commercial solution backed by major private capital provides the best outcome for the business, its employees and all stakeholders concerned without cost to UK taxpayers or unnecessary uncertainty". A government intervention in Scunthorpe in 2019 cost the Treasury Â£600m during the 10 months it took to find Chinese buyer Jingye and since April, the government is back running day to day operations after it accused Jingye of planning to shut down its furnaces. The government has said its looking for a commercial partner but that nationalisation of the plant is the most likely option.

U.S. equities were mostly in the red at midday, dragged for a second session by tech stocks, as well as a mixed bag of earnings news. The Nasdaq dropped 1%, the S&P 500 was down as well, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Shares of artificial intelligence (AI)-related firms, including Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA), continued to lose ground on concerns about a possible slowdown in corporate AI spending. Target (TGT) shares tumbled when the struggling retailer replaced its CEO and posted another drop in sales. La-Z-Boy (LZB) shares sank after the furniture manufacturer's earnings declined on fewer in-store sales and soft demand for its Joybird brand. TJX (TJX) shares gained when the operator of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods stores exceeded profit forecasts and raised its guidance, saying it expects to be able to offset any tariff costs. Shares of Jack Henry & Associations (JKHY) advanced after the financial technology firm posted better-than-expected results as customers spent more on tech products. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares increased on an upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the processed food company's portfolio is attractive, with consumers interested in eating foods with more protein and fewer artificial ingredients. Oil and gold futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Major technology stocks tied to artificial intelligence took a sharp downward turn Tuesday, rattling markets and raising concerns the sector’s billion-dollar promises may not be bearing fruit as quickly as hoped. Shares of Palantir Technologies, the data-analytics firm widely viewed as an AI bellwether, plunged more than 9%, its worst tumble since March, after prominent short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research renewed his bearish stance. Other major names felt similar shocks, highlighting underlying investor doubts: Oracle, in the midst of aggressive AI investments and a strategic pivot that included mass layoffs in its cloud division, saw its shares drop nearly 6%. Chipmakers integral to the AI boom struggled as well: Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.4%, Arm Holdings lost 5%, and Nvidia, the sector’s dominant force, slid 3.5%. SoftBank, whose outsize bets on AI have defined its recent strategy, dropped more than 7%—amplifying concerns about a broader tech correction and underscoring Wall Street’s uneasy relationship with the so-called next big thing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even admitted AI is in a bubble. The abrupt selloff echoes broader skepticism about the sustainability of sky-high valuations seen in AI-focused companies. But experts say that while investors are right to be cautious, the underlying technology isn’t going away—and this is a short-term drop during a long-term transformation. Behind the market jitters, a recent report from MIT said approximately 95% of company generative AI pilot programs resulted in “little to no measurable impact” on revenue or profits. While a handful of startups have thrived, the vast majority of corporate efforts have stalled, caught in flawed enterprise integrations and learning gaps. The research, encompassing 150 executive interviews, 350 employee surveys, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments, paints a sobering picture: Outside exceptional cases, generative AI projects have yet to justify the vast spending across the sector. MIT’s lead author, Aditya Challapally, told Fortune failure may lie less in the underlying tools than in enterprise execution, citing issues around workflow adaptation and resource allocation. In contrast, nimble startups have rapidly scaled revenues—validating the potential of the technology when well integrated, but also highlighting a gulf between hype and reality for larger companies. “There’s no doubt that when MIT reports a 95% failure rate in AI pilot programs, it’s alarming,” Mike Sinoway, CEO of AI-powered search software company Lucidworks, told Fortune. “But the problem has less to do with the underlying technology and more with how companies are approaching it. “In our own research, polling over 1,600 AI practitioners and leaders and validating this with bot analysis, we found 65% of teams are rolling out AI without the fundamental tech infrastructure in place,” he said. “Trying to build cutting-edge applications atop weak foundations is like building an F1 car on a go-kart engine—you simply won’t get results. So while a 95% failure rate might seem like a sign of a bubble, once organizations focus more on what AI actually needs to succeed, we’ll begin to see the traction everyone is expecting.” Chase Feiger, CEO of Ostro, an AI-powered platform for life sciences brands, agreed current volatility is part of a typical tech cycle. “Talk of an AI bubble isn’t new,” Feiger told Fortune. “Every major tech shift goes through a stage where hype runs ahead of business fundamentals,” he said. “Some companies are burning money on inference costs, offering ‘all-you-can-eat’ models that cost thousands to run but bring in only hundreds in revenue—a pattern reminiscent of Uber’s early years. That overinflation explains market caution, but the underlying technology isn’t overhyped. In health care, for example, AI is transforming drug development, patient care, and physician decision-making. “The correction will come. But over the long haul, the winners will be those who prove AI delivers durable value in complex, high-stakes environments,” Feiger added. Harvard professor Christina Inge told Fortune the duality at work is nothing new. “Investors are right to be cautious,” she said. “Not every company claiming to be ‘AI-driven’ is creating real value; a lot of it is smoke and mirrors, with some tools amounting to incremental improvements on non-AI tech. Correction is inevitable, as history shows. “But the technology isn’t going away. AI is already making a difference in health care, marketing, logistics, and finance. And we’re only scratching the surface. In the long run, I expect the impact of AI to rival the Industrial Revolution. There’s a lot of froth in the market right now, but the bigger story is just beginning. In other words: short-term bubble, long-term transformation.” That view is echoed by Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities. “What we’re seeing isn’t a bubble, but the foundation of a new economy,” Boloor told Fortune. “There will be volatility—inevitable with a sector this hot—but the fundamental reality is every industry will be transformed by AI. Just look at Microsoft and Meta this quarter: Azure hit its biggest revenue numbers ever, Microsoft Cloud crossed $46 billion, and Meta monetized not just attention but intelligence, with 22% revenue growth and 38% profit growth, while spending $70 billion in capex. The demand is not hypothetical—it’s scaling now. “We’re not at the peak of AI. We’re at an inflection point.” Siamak Freydoonnejad, cofounder of Sprites AI, which makes an AI-powered marketing agent, says, however, deciding whether or not we’re in an AI bubble “misses the point” entirely. “Stock prices may have outpaced fundamentals, but inside enterprises, AI is already infrastructure,” Freydoonnejad told Fortune. “No one who’s seen campaign launch speed improve by 70% is going back to the old way,” he said. “Some vendors did slap ‘AI’ on legacy products to cash in, but those valuations will be corrected—and deservedly so. What matters is which firms are using AI not as a shallow trend but as the basis for their entire product. Real efficiency gains are showing up for companies embedding AI deeply in their workflows. The market is about to sort out those with substantive results from those selling only promises.” Omar Kouhlani, CEO of Runmic, which uses AI to design revenue strategies for sales teams, told Fortune infrastructure spending reveals the true momentum. “Big Tech just raised AI spending guidance to $360 billion–plus for 2025, up sharply from previous estimates. I watch those numbers more closely than day-to-day share price changes,” he said. “This isn’t a rejection of AI, it’s a market becoming more selective,” Kouhlani continued. “The crash is separating real AI revenues from companies that only have AI PowerPoints. We’re not in another dotcom bust. The infrastructure is being built now, and expectations are adjusting faster than the technology itself.” Usha Haley, the W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business and professor of management at the Barton School of Business at Wichita State University, argues that cycles of bubbles and corrections are intrinsic to tech revolutions. “Historically, every breakthrough technology comes with bubbles,” Haley told Fortune. “AI is already delivering productivity gains, even as it erodes some jobs. We’ll see some correction and consolidation, but not a collapse. The strongest players will emerge into a changed landscape. Regulation and stochastic shocks could alter outcomes, but competitive environments—not monopolies—will point to future leaders.” Fabian Stephany, a lecturer at the University of Oxford, sees evidence for both sides: “To some extent, yes, there is an AI bubble. But long-term fundamentals are exceptionally strong,” he told Fortune. “Many firms use AI for marketing more than substance, which has inflated valuations. Yet stock-market gains this year are overwhelmingly linked to real advances in AI at companies like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom. Nvidia alone accounts for 26% of the S&P’s advance, underscoring real market transformation.” David Brudenell, executive director at Decidr, which builds an AI-powered operating system for businesses to automate workflows, told Fortune that “correction is necessary” as it “separates speculation from structural value.” And David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, agreed: “Pullbacks are normal after rallies stall. “Major players like Palantir and Microsoft failed to hold breakouts after strong earnings. That’s a sign the good news may be priced in,” Russell told Fortune. “Markets move ahead of fundamentals, but excessive prices punish those chasing the froth. In the weeks ahead, sentiment could shift to other macro factors.” The expert consensus is clear: While stocks have pulled back, the fundamentals behind AI remain strong. Most believe the recent rout is an overdue market sorting—separating hype from reality, speculation from enduring value. Even MIT’s cautious findings are seen as a spur rather than a death knell. Now, all eyes will turn to Nvidia, which reports quarterly earnings next week. But broadly speaking, what the market is experiencing isn’t a sign of crisis, but a marker of growing pains.

Title: The big buydown bet

Good morning. If you bought the Great Value raw frozen shrimp at Walmart, throw it away. The FDA says a possible contamination from Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, has been detected. Don't sell it, don't serve it, and definitely don't eat it — no matter how much BI's Katie Notopoulos may want to. In today's big story, homebuyers made a big bet on lower mortgage rates. They're paying a high price. What's on deck: Markets: Bank of America thinks these 10 cheap stocks are poised for big gains. Tech: This party is the surest sign yet that the tech dating scene is a mess. Business: In its latest hardcore turn, AT&T is hitting some managers with an ultimatum. But first, betting the house. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. For homebuilders, it represented a silver bullet. For buyers, it can be a mousetrap. Rick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm since last summer about a dangerous gamble tempting Americans: "mortgage rate buydowns." They seemed to offer an elegant solution. With mortgage rates sky-high, your dream home might feel out of reach. That's not good for you, nor for the homebuilders stuck with inventory. But what if a homebuilder shaved a percentage point off your monthly payments, even just for the first couple of years? Surely, rates must drop soon. When the deal runs out, you could refinance. Easy. The cost to builders is the upfront cash to lower the rate via their in-house lenders. Matt Hutton, a millennial homebuyer, told BI his builder threw in $30,000 in incentives — including the buydown — to close the deal. You buy your house. They sell theirs. Crucially, the official listing price doesn't change, so home values remain inflated. That was the wager a few years ago. Today, rates are typically still above 6.5% — right where buyers had hoped not to end up. Their gamble has failed spectacularly, BI's James Rodriguez writes. There's an even more dire scenario, Palacios warns. What if you need to sell? Life happens — a new job, a marriage, a divorce — and you may have to move. But today's sellers face a weak market. In many parts of the US, more homes are sitting unsold than at any point since the pandemic. Buyers a few years ago may have accepted inflated prices in exchange for monthly savings — but they can't usually pass those savings along to the next buyer. To close a deal, they may have to take a loss. Just ask Hutton. After five years, he and his wife sold their first home for a $150,000 profit and upgraded to a bigger, brand-new home for nearly $800,000. A few months later, they wanted out. They ended up selling it for roughly what they paid for it, after dropping their asking price by $50,000. In addition, the buyer asked them to cover a $40,000 buydown to match the builder's ongoing incentives for nearby homes. They agreed. Today, Hutton and his wife are back in an apartment, waiting for another shot at the dream. 1. Wage growth isn't keeping up with prices. However, some industries have enjoyed more growth than others. Business services and financial activities have less purchasing power than they did in 2021, while hospitality and healthcare workers have more. 2. Bank of America shares 10 ultra-cheap stocks primed to rebound. The bank thinks the days of large-cap stock dominance are numbered. If the US enters a recovery phase alongside rate cuts, beaten-down stocks could surge. 3. A short-seller explains why he thinks Palantir is overvalued. In a new note, Andrew Left's firm Citron Research used OpenAI's $500 billion valuation as a benchmark to measure the defense tech giant against. Even if Palantir fell to $40 a share, it'd still be expensive, the firm said. 1. Inside San Francisco's "enforced ratio" party in a Tesla showroom. Fed up with male-dominated spaces in SF, two women who work in the tech industry threw a bash centered around "feminine energy." It offered a rare chance to dress up and a strictly enforced 50/50 gender ratio — which, of course, left hundreds of men on the waitlist. 2. Another W for Tim Cook. The Apple CEO notched a win in his fight with the UK government, which had ordered the company to make encrypted user data accessible to it. Apple enjoyed the backing of the US government, which said that the UK had agreed to drop the order. 3. Do you miss the old internet? There's an app for that. Perfectly Imperfect is a newsletter and social network that's designed to feel like the old version of the internet, reminiscent of Tumblr and MySpace. Its founder told BI it's betting on events and community-focused tools to grow. 1. AT&T tells some managers: Relocate or get laid off. The telecom company is consolidating 22 internal help-desk centers into six US locations. Affected managers get two weeks to decide whether to move or lose their jobs and get severance, BI's Tim Paradis and Dominick Reuter exclusively report. 2. Spike Lee's Colin Kaepernick doc is officially game over. The acclaimed director has no plans to shop around his scrapped ESPN docuseries about the retired football player to other platforms. "That thing fell apart a year ago," Lee said in an interview with BI's Jason Guerrasio. "I've moved on." 3. We still don't know if Trump is getting free ads from Paramount. Trump says Larry and David Ellison promised him millions in free ads, but Paramount CEO David Ellison doesn't want to comment on it. We shouldn't be left guessing about what's true, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore.

Title: AI Industry Trembles as Nvidia's Stock Nosedives
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-industry-nvidia-stock
Time Published: 2025-08-20T14:39:27Z
Full Content:
Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia plunged on Wednesday, dropping by more than three percent in early trading — for a total slide of over five percent in the past week. Other major AI players fell as well, including Google, Meta, and Tesla. AI software company Palantir's stock fell by nearly nine percent this morning. Nvidia is particularly interesting, though, because while those other companies mainly produce software, Nvidia has been making bank by selling the hardware powering the AI industry's explosive ascent. If the AI industry is a gold rush, then Nvidia is selling shovels — and when the shovel seller starts to struggle, everybody gets nervous. Analysts were left perplexed by the selloff, casting around for specific causes. Could muted enthusiasm and AI data center Coreweave's 38 percent collapse post Q2 earnings be coming after the AI industry's top performers? Nvidia's shares fell after Reuters reported that the firm was working on a new generation AI chip for the Chinese market, which could potentially outperform its H20 workhorse. There are also certain signs of internal shakiness, with CEO Jensen Huang recently 150,000 shares for tens of millions of dollars last week. However, the sale was planned in March, and was triggered by hitting predetermined parameters, such as price and volume. In other words, it's not entirely clear what's causing the selloff. Nvidia and its ilk are still up considerably if you zoom out; both Nvidia and Palantir hit all-time highs earlier this month. Palantir alone rose more than 150 percent since April. Could the latest selloff be a market correction, a reality check in light of some sky-high valuations? There has been considerable talk of the AI industry showing signs of a dot com era-style bubble. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself acknowledged last week that we're in a "phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI." How long Nvidia's drop in share price will last remains to be seen. The company's meteoric rise has repeatedly been met by bullish investors buying the dip, sending it to all-time highs. Nvidia will be reporting its second-quarter earnings a week from now. Investors expect strong Q2 results, and given enormous sales and continued optimism surrounding AI, it's not a stretch to assume they'll be satisfied. If anything, investors are as optimistic as ever, suggesting that the AI industry's gravy train isn't likely to stop any time soon. "NVDA is now the most under-owned large-cap tech stock," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this week, as quoted by Yahoo Finance.

August 20, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global digital health in neurology market was valued at US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 229.5 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 21.8% during the forecast period 2025–2033. Digital therapeutics (DTx) are emerging as a powerful new class of medicine. These software-based interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic programs directly to patients. In the area of ADHD, Akili Interactive's EndeavorOTC is making significant inroads. A 2024 registry study revealed that 58.2% of its users reported having combined type ADHD. The data also highlighted significant comorbidities, with 69% of users reporting depression and 56% reporting an anxiety disorder. A remarkable 87% of users stated they had no to moderate symptom control with their existing ADHD treatments. For a quarter of users, difficulties in obtaining their medication prompted them to try EndeavorOTC in the digital health in neurology market. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/digital-health-in-neurology-market Another innovation, the Revibe smartwatch for children with ADHD, demonstrated its efficacy in a study with 706 participants. Children using the device showed a more than 25-minute increase in attention span after just three weeks. The study also recorded a 19% increase in on-task behaviors. Further validation for EndeavorOTC came from a 2024 study of 220 adults, which found clear improvements in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. An earlier 2021 study of EndeavorRx for children with ADHD showed that after two months, over two-thirds of the 206 participants' parents reported improvements in their child's ADHD-related impairments. Key Findings in Digital Health in Neurology Market Virtual Care Platforms are Erasing Distances in Neurological Patient Management Telemedicine is dismantling traditional barriers to neurological care with remarkable speed in the digital health in neurology market. Virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring (RPM) are now standard practice, offering convenience and enhanced oversight. A 2024 survey of pediatric epilepsy providers found 67.9% of their centers now use video visits exclusively for telehealth. A vast majority, 83%, believe these platforms provide more equitable healthcare access. The removal of transportation barriers stands out as a significant driver for teleneurology adoption in 2024. Projections show that by 2025, over 71 million Americans will use some form of RPM service. The utility of telehealth is undeniable. The 2024 study also showed that 92.5% of pediatric epilepsy providers use it for reviewing test results, while 96.2% use it to discuss treatment plan changes. The financial and clinical impact is staggering. The telestroke services market is projected to reach USD 1.99 billion by 2025, with cloud-based platforms dominating 85.3% of that market. A lifetime analysis of a telestroke program revealed an average societal cost saving of $1,526 per patient. Patients also experienced an incremental gain of 0.45 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A separate hub-and-spoke telestroke network model demonstrated a lifetime cost saving of $1,436 per patient and a 0.02 QALY gain. A 5-year model of one such network projected an annual cost saving of $358,435 for the entire system, with each spoke hospital saving an estimated $109,080 annually. Ultimately, implementing a telestroke program was associated with a reduction of 101 nursing home residents per 10,000 patients. The digital health in neurology market is clearly benefiting from these efficiency gains. Wearable Technology Unleashes a Continuous Stream of Actionable Patient Data Wearable sensors and mobile health applications are fundamentally changing patient monitoring. They provide a continuous flow of real-world data, empowering both patients and clinicians. The digital health in neurology market is leveraging these tools for proactive disease management. In Parkinson's disease, Rune Labs' StrivePD platform saw its user network expand by 56% in 2024. A nine-month pilot study of the platform involving 138 patients yielded impressive results. Participants experienced a 42% reduction in emergency room visits and an 18% reduction in time needed with movement disorder specialists. The behavioral impact was also significant, with 90% of users increasing their exercise levels and 80% showing improved medication adherence. Rune Labs' 2024 research is powered by a rich dataset from over 1,000 Parkinson's patients using the platform. The momentum extends to other conditions as well. As of 2025, the global market for epilepsy monitoring devices is projected to be valued at an impressive USD 582.3 million. Artificial Intelligence Is Driving a New Era of Diagnostic Precision Artificial intelligence (AI) is supercharging diagnostic capabilities within digital health in neurology market. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex medical data with unprecedented speed and accuracy. For Parkinson's disease, a condition where early diagnosis is challenging, a new AI software called Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism (AIDP) has demonstrated the ability to increase diagnostic precision to beyond 96%. This is a monumental leap compared to the current diagnostic accuracy of 55% to 78% within the first five years. A systematic review of 127 studies on AI-driven Parkinson's diagnosis found accuracy rates consistently ranging from 78% to 96%. An experimental multimodal AI diagnostic framework achieved a 94.2% accuracy in detecting early-stage disease. A deep-learning model analyzing medical and prescription data from 820 Parkinson's patients achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.937 when using data from three years preceding diagnosis. When analyzing an even earlier period (3-6 years before diagnosis), the model's accuracy improved to 0.922 with the inclusion of medication data. The trend extends to other conditions, with the US FDA clearing the NeuroQuant 5.0 software, an AI-powered tool for assessing MRI scans of patients being treated for Alzheimer's disease. These advancements are a cornerstone of the digital health in neurology market. Immersive Virtual Reality Therapies Are Redefining Neurorehabilitation Possibilities Virtual Reality (VR) is creating highly engaging and effective therapeutic environments for neurological recovery. The technology is proving particularly useful for patients recovering from stroke, brain injuries, and amputations. In a groundbreaking clinical trial for phantom limb pain, a VR treatment requiring leg movements led to a 39.6% pain reduction among seven participants with lower-limb amputations. Even a distractor VR treatment without leg movements in the same study resulted in a notable 28% decrease in pain. This early success has prompted an expansion of the proof-of-concept study, which initially involved eight subjects with below-knee amputations, to a larger sample size. These immersive solutions represent a high-growth segment within the broader digital health in neurology market, offering new hope for patients undergoing difficult rehabilitation journeys. Digital Biomarkers Are Accelerating the Pace of Neurological Clinical Research Digital biomarkers are revolutionizing how researchers track disease progression and treatment efficacy. Collected via sensors and mobile devices, these objective data points provide a high-frequency view of a patient's condition. Their impact on clinical trial efficiency is profound in the digital health in neurology market. A trial simulation for a hypothetical Parkinson's digital biomarker showed it could lead to a 55.7% reduction in the number of subjects needed for a one-year trial if it detected disease progression just 1.5 times faster than standard assessments. The same simulation indicated that a digital biomarker with a 0.5-fold reduced standard deviation could allow for a trial with 70.0% fewer subjects per arm. Companies are actively building a presence in this space. As of 2024, Rune Labs, a key player focused on digital biomarkers for Parkinson's, had already participated in 15 scientific conferences to share its findings. Robust Investment and a Dynamic Competitive Landscape Signal Strong Market Confidence The financial community is taking notice of the immense potential in neurotechnology. Venture capital and strategic investments are flowing into the digital health in neurology market, fueling innovation. In 2024, European tech companies raised over €1.1 billion in seed funding, with total funding for startups reaching $51 billion. Healthcare and biotechnology was the leading investment sector, attracting over $11 billion. The median pre-seed funding round in Europe grew by 15.7% in the second half of 2024 to €870,000. Specific deals highlight this trend. In October 2024, iGent AI secured a €7.6M seed round, Nomos raised a €1.9M pre-seed round, and In Parallel secured €2.78 million. The competitive landscape is equally dynamic. Blackrock Neurotech received a massive $200 million investment from Tether in 2024, valuing the company at approximately $350 million. Its NeuroPort Array system, priced at over half a million dollars, has been sold to several dozen hospitals. Blackrock Neurotech's estimated annual revenue is $60.7 million, with an estimated revenue per employee of $306,778. Before the latest investment, the company had already raised $50 million and had seen early revenue grow from approximately $700,000 to $3.5 million. Meanwhile, Rune Labs announced a strategic $12 million investment round in 2024, bringing its total funding to $42 million. Its StrivePD platform is also being used in a care management program with Kaiser Permanente. Customize the Data Scope to Match Your Objectives: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/digital-health-in-neurology-market Evolving Regulations and Emerging Technologies Are Charting the Industry's Future The future of the digital health in neurology market is being shaped by evolving regulatory frameworks and next-generation technologies. Regulators are adapting to the unique nature of software-based medical devices. As of September 2023, Japan had approved only three therapeutic apps. To accelerate innovation, Japan's PMDA set a six-month target review time for priority Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) products as of January 2024. A new two-stage approval system for SaMD was also expected in 2024. Patient engagement is another critical factor. A Mayo Clinic study of its RPM program found a patient engagement rate over 78%. A latest report published in 2025 found that 62% of healthcare leaders in the digital health in neurology market believe Generative AI holds the highest potential for improving patient engagement. Indeed, a 2025 survey revealed 51% of people have already used Generative AI to help diagnose symptoms. Looking ahead, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) represent the next frontier. The global BCI market was valued at USD 2.3 billion in 2024 and is expected to soar to USD 4.5 billion by 2029.

August 20, 2025 09:53 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, will launch a digital, blockchain-powered platform in early 2026, designed to expand its entertainment ecosystem far beyond the stage and into the hands, homes, and dashboards of music fans everywhere. The platform will introduce tokenized digital memberships, fan rewards, and soft ticketing services, marking VENU’s entry into the fast-emerging world of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The technology will leverage blockchain infrastructure to deliver secure, flexible, and immersive experiences, redefining how fans access, own, and interact with live music and events. “VENU intends to own the narrative around digital engagement with fans, dramatically improving live-streamed entertainment while unlocking totally new experiences for fan ownership,” said J.W. Roth, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of VENU. The announcement comes as VENU aggressively scales its physical venue footprint. Roth confirmed the Company’s near-term and long-term vision, “With the opening of three new amphitheaters in 2026 and a target of 25 amphitheaters and 15 indoor entertainment complexes by 2030, we will own over 350,000 seats, which should equate to over 20 million annual tickets sold with over $2 billion in gross ticket sales volume.” That level of ticketing volume positions VENU as one of the largest players in U.S. live entertainment, behind only the publicly traded national operator known for its massive touring footprint, and a leading secondary market platform that just refiled its IPO prospectus last week at a rumored $16.5 billion valuation, a move puts live entertainment squarely back in Wall Street’s spotlight. Roth emphasized that VENU’s blockchain initiative is not simply a tech bolt-on but a core part of its forward strategy. “One of the most exciting opportunities in financial technology is ‘real world asset’ tokenization – the opportunity to use a technology wrapper to bring tangible goods or services to the blockchain, supercharging their utility. The first use-case to achieve product-market fit were dollar-backed stablecoins; today, there are more than $250 billion in circulation. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said on CNBC this month that ‘tokenization is an innovation,’ and we agree. The next step could be the tokenization of new types of assets, and at VENU we see an opportunity to potentially tokenize our seats, our soft ticketing platform, and our overall fan experiences.” By combining blockchain with its growing network of physical venues, VENU is positioning itself as a disruptive force in both the live entertainment and digital media industries. “A blockchain-powered soft ticket experience should significantly increase overall ticket sales while inviting a much larger audience to enjoy unique and invaluable live experiences within the VENU ecosystem,” Roth added. “As our VENU network grows, a digital engagement layer can unify benefits across our properties, reduce friction in soft ticketing and rewards, and create a direct channel to our superfans and partners. I believe this will catapult VENU into becoming a global distributor of live music.” With growing institutional interest, including a recent disclosure from Vanguard Group showing a new 861,911-share position, and a digital strategy aligned with future-forward trends, VENU is quickly becoming one of the most exciting public stories in the intersection of entertainment, real estate, and blockchain innovation. VENU plans to provide further updates as discussions progress and definitive agreements are reached. Please click here to read Cenorium’s full Venu analyst report on 247marketnews.com.

Title: Defiance ETFs Launches Leveraged + Income ETFs for AMD (AMDU) and Super Micro Computer (SMCC)

Time Published: 2025-08-20T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
August 20, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs, a leading innovator in thematic and leveraged exchange-traded funds, today announced the launch of two new single-stock leveraged ETFs with income strategies: Defiance Leveraged Long + Income AMD ETF (NASDAQ: AMDU) – providing leveraged exposure to Advanced Micro Devices. Defiance Leveraged Long + Income SMCI ETF (NASDAQ: SMCC) – providing leveraged exposure to Super Micro Computer. Each ETF combines approximately 150%–200% leveraged exposure to its underlying stock with an options-based credit call spread income strategy, designed to offer investors amplified growth potential and consistent cash flow. What Sets These Funds Apart Why These Companies? Investment ObjectivesEach ETF seeks long-term capital appreciation as its primary objective, with a secondary objective of current income. The leveraged strategy provides amplified exposure to the underlying stock, while the income strategy uses credit call spreads to generate premium income and manage risk associated with leverage. The Fund may not achieve daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 150% to 200% the performance of the Underlying Security, and may return substantially less during such periods. During such periods, the Fund’s actual leverage levels may differ substantially from its intended leverage target range, both intraday and at the close of trading, potentially resulting in significantly lower returns. About DefianceFounded in 2018, Defiance is at the forefront of ETF innovation. The firm specializes in thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs, including first-mover leveraged single-stock products that empower investors to take amplified positions in high‑growth companies. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURESThe Funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Funds’ investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. An investment in any Fund is not an investment in its underlying company (Advanced Micro Devices or Super Micro Computer). AMDU Risks. The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of Advanced Micro Devices (“AMD”). If the share price of AMD decreases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. Indirect Investment in AMD Risk: AMD is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser or their affiliates and is not involved with this offering. Investors in the Fund will not have voting rights in AMD but will be exposed to its performance. AMD Trading Risk: The trading price of AMD may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. AMD Performance Risk: AMD may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations, which could cause its share price to decline. Semiconductor Industry Risk: The semiconductor industry can be significantly affected by cyclical demand, rapid technological change, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in global trade policy. Competition Risk: AMD competes with other major semiconductor manufacturers, and changes in market share, pricing, or product adoption could materially affect its performance. SMCC Risks. The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of Super Micro Computer (“SMCI”). If the share price of SMCI decreases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. Indirect Investment in SMCI Risk: SMCI is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser or their affiliates and is not involved with this offering. Investors in the Fund will not have voting rights in SMCI but will be exposed to its performance. SMCI Trading Risk: The trading price of SMCI may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. SMCI Performance Risk: SMCI may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations, which could cause its share price to decline. Technology Hardware Industry Risk: Companies in the server and data center hardware industry can be significantly affected by component shortages, rapid technological change, competition, cybersecurity threats, and shifts in customer demand. Supply Chain Risk: SMCI’s operations depend on timely access to key components and manufacturing capacity. Disruptions in global supply chains could materially impact production schedules, costs, and profitability. Additional Risks. Derivatives Risks: Derivative investments can exhibit imperfect correlation to the underlying assets or index and may result in losses greater than the initial investment. Leverage Risk: Swap contracts and options create additional investment exposure to the underlying securities and increase the potential for loss. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk: Over periods longer than a single trading day, compounding may cause performance to differ from the stated leverage target range. High Portfolio Turnover Risk: A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may raise expenses and reduce performance. Non-Diversification Risk: Because the Funds are non-diversified, they may invest a greater percentage of assets in a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers. New Fund Risk: As newly formed funds, they have no operating history, providing limited basis for investors to assess performance or management. Brokerage commissions may be charged on trades.

Bitcoin ETFs saw $121.7 million in outflows on Monday and $523.3 million on Tuesday according to Farside Investors data, while Ethereum funds mirrored the weakness with $196.6 million and $422.2 million withdrawn on the same days. Fidelity's FBTC led the exodus with $246.9 million in redemptions, while Grayscale's GBTC shed $115.5 million and Bitwise's BITB lost $86.8 million across the two-day period. Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt that spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing outflows as investors "scale back risk ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting and Jerome Powell's speech on Friday." The latest withdrawals break momentum from mid-July through early August, when Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.7 billion in inflows at roughly $135 million a day. Otychenko attributed the selling to weak job growth combined with mixed inflation data that "left the Fed in a difficult spot, leaving the markets more uncertain about the path of future rate cuts." Net Taker Volume, which tracks whether buyers or sellers dominate exchange activity, plummeted to its “lowest point since December 2021,” indicating widespread selling pressure, he said. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's rallies since March have followed a weakening pattern, with "each breakout weaker, with smaller price moves and lighter trading volume." Dean Chen, analyst at Bitunix, shared similar sentiment, telling Decrypt the outflows stem from two main drivers: macro de-risking as "U.S. PPI came in hotter than expected" and issuer-level profit taking ahead of Powell's Jackson Hole speech. He noted that BlackRock's IBIT recorded zero flow, which "tells us this is more tactical de-risking than broad institutional exit." Konstantin Anissimov, global CEO of Currency.com, also remarked to Decrypt the outflows represent "a broad de-risking move rather than a problem with any single ETF." He pointed out that redemptions shifted from BlackRock and ARK on Monday to Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise the following day, showing "investors across the board are taking some chips off the table." Despite the substantial ETF outflows, Bitcoin's price is down just 1.5% on the day according to CoinGecko data, which Anissimov attributed to buyers using "$32 billion in stablecoin cash sitting on exchanges" to absorb the selling. He characterized institutional sentiment as "cautious right now, but not panicked," calling the movement "short-term profit-taking" rather than a fundamental shift. Markets now enter a critical waiting period as Powell's address approaches, with institutional flows likely to remain volatile until monetary policy clarity emerges.

August 20, 2025 07:13 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Weekly Payers and Group C ETFs listed in the table below. Standardized Performance and Fund details can be obtained by clicking the ETF Ticker in the table above or by visiting us at www.yieldmaxetfs.com Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864 3968. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH, YQQQ and WNTR are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax® ETFs. As such, these Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax® ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GPTY) Artificial Intelligence Risk. Issuers engaged in artificial intelligence typically have high research and capital expenditures and, as a result, their profitability can vary widely, if they are profitable at all. The space in which they are engaged is highly competitive and issuers’ products and services may become obsolete very quickly. These companies are heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. The issuers are also subject to legal, regulatory, and political changes that may have a large impact on their profitability. A failure in an issuer’s product or even questions about the safety of the product could be devastating to the issuer, especially if it is the marquee product of the issuer. It can be difficult to accurately capture what qualifies as an artificial intelligence company. Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will invest substantially in companies in the information technology sector, and therefore the performance of the Fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector. Market or economic factors impacting technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have a significant effect on the value of the Fund’s investments. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Information technology companies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to CHPY) Semiconductor Industry Risk. Semiconductor companies may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Semiconductor companies' supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide components and services. The products of semiconductor companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial, and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: With The Rising Cost Of Groceries, Is It Cheaper To Just Eat Out?

On Assignment For HuffPost With grocery prices rising lately, sometimes it seems to make more sense to grab a bite at a restaurant or order DoorDash rather than buy groceries and cook at home. To find out whether this is really true, we spoke with experts — and found there are a number of factors you may not have considered. “Let’s be honest: Saying it’s always cheaper to eat out is like saying it’s cheaper to rent a tux every day instead of doing your laundry,” said Rocco Carulli, owner and executive chef at R House in Miami. “In reality it depends on what you order, how you shop and whether you’re actually using your fridge for food and not just beverages and expired condiments. Groceries can save you money — but only if you use what you buy and know how to turn raw ingredients into real meals. Restaurants can be efficient if you’re choosing well, stretching your portions or just accepting that you’re paying for peace of mind and a clean kitchen.” The current trend points to more people buying groceries than eating out. According to a Revenue Management Solutions survey, “40% of U.S. diners said they’re spending less of their disposable income on restaurants. Instead, many are turning to grocery stores: 1 in 4 consumers reported shopping there more often, with nearly 40% citing better value for money.” “People who believe it is cheaper to eat at restaurants than at home often live in food deserts,” said Matthew Baron, CEO of Wholesale Nuts and Dried Fruits. “In these areas, it could be cheaper to eat out than to shop for the ingredients that you want. Even Malibu, California, could be considered a food desert after the fires took out half of the houses and businesses. All the citizens left to live there have to drive to the next neighborhood of Santa Monica to find a supermarket to shop at.” Driving involves wear and tear on your car and money spent on gas. Public transportation and ride shares can be expensive, and grocery delivery isn’t always affordable. “If health is the goal, eat at home,” he said. “If you live in a food desert, then go out to restaurants.” Andrea Woroch, a budgeting expert, suggested taking advantage of lunch specials and happy hours, sticking to water instead of soda and alcohol (those are marked up), and splitting entrees. “Restaurant meals are usually larger than your home-cooked meals and more than you can eat,” she said. “Get in the habit of splitting a large entree with your partner or friend and see if you need more food, or add a small plate before to fill you up for less.” Marc Mezzacca, founder and savings expert at CouponFollow, said to not order fries, fried seafood or salads, because they don’t make good leftovers. “But you can stretch a restaurant meal if you play it right,” Carulli said. “Order something substantial — pastas, braised meats, grain bowls — and you’ve got built-in leftovers. That’s two meals for the price of one entrée, and you didn’t have to julienne a single thing.” “Stick with generics,” Woroch said. “This is a tried and true savings method that still applies and shouldn’t be ignored because it cuts your grocery bill by 30% on average. Compare ingredients side by side between the national name brand and store brand to see how they stack up and give it a go. Many stores will allow for returns if you’re not satisfied, so it’s worth a try.” She said food that’s about to expire will be discounted, too, up to 50%. “Just make sure to cook it right away or freeze it to avoid it going bad,” she said. Mezzacca recommended shopping at places like Costco and buying pantry staples like lentils and pasta in bulk. “Frozen fruits and vegetables are good as they are affordable, last longer and reduce waste,” Mezzacca said. “Cooking ahead of time and cooking in bulk minimizes spoilage and impulse buying. Sometimes, dining out can have a convenience and economic factor. But with groceries, there is more control over portion size, ingredients and long-term values.” If you’re single or in a couple or don’t have kids, it might make sense to eat out more. But if you have three kids like Deliciously Rushed food blogger Rose Sioson does, cooking at home is the way to go. “It’s definitely cheaper for us to buy groceries than eat out,” she said. “The trick is planning. Before I shop, I do a simple meal plan so we only buy what we’ll actually cook and eat. That way, we’re not throwing money or food away. Eating out can be fun, but for a big family, even splitting meals or bringing home leftovers adds up fast.” She spends 10-15 minutes a week planning meals based on what’s already in stock and then adds what she needs to a grocery list. She shops at Costco and recommends the rotisserie chicken and bulk items like rice. Based on her haul, she’ll plan theme nights like a stir-fry night or a taco night or leftovers night. And the freezer is your friend. “Use your freezer as your backup plan — freeze leftovers, extra bread, herbs or meats,” she said. “Prep meats ahead of time. I portion and cut them before freezing, so when it’s time to cook, I just thaw them in the fridge and they’re ready to go.” Food waste is a serious issue and a way to not get enough bang for your buck. “Don’t let half the cart go limp in the veggie drawer,” Carulli said. “Bulk buying helps, but only if you’re not bulk-wasting. And don’t get me started on herbs. You buy one $4 bundle, use three leaves and the rest disintegrates into compost.” To save money, he recommended shopping at farmers markets, and, like Sioson said, purchasing a rotisserie chicken. “Roast a chicken Sunday, use it in tacos Monday, soup Tuesday and a grain bowl Wednesday,” he said. “That’s one ingredient, four meals, zero waste.” For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Carulli thinks people should allow themselves to eat out once in a while. “Cook when you’ve got the energy, eat out when you need the ease — or the entertainment,” he said. “If cooking dinner means stress, mess and a meltdown, give yourself permission to tap out.

Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, called this “a cautious price target” in an interview with CNBC at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. He pointed to supply-and-demand dynamics as the primary driver, saying “there’s just way more demand than the issued supply of Bitcoin, or the existing overall supply in the marketplace.” “I just think it’s a function of buying and only 450 Bitcoin being made by the network per day,” he told CNBC. In the interview, Scaramucci emphasized the “consolidation and institutional adoption” of Bitcoin over the past year, citing the launch of ETFs by firms such as BlackRock and the growing role of institutional investors. “If you went to a conference like this three years ago, it was mostly retail investors and CEOs working in the layer-one blockchain space,” he said. “Today, it’s lots more institutional investors.” Scaramucci predicted that much of this institutional investment “will likely go into the ETFs” as opposed to corporate Bitcoin investment vehicles like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a legacy tech firm which has built up one of the world's largest Bitcoin treasuries. Scaramucci has previously criticized companies that have adopted Strategy’s tactic of issuing debt to buy BTC for their corporate reserves. He argued that JPMorgan will choose to buy their Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, saying “it's a very secure asset that people trust,” calling it the "purest link to Bitcoin.” This is currently the world's largest BTC fund as of writing. Scaramucci isn’t alone in issuing bullish end-of-year predictions. Earlier this week, institutional investor VanEck made a comparable prediction of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by year-end. Scaramucci expressed a fairly bullish view about stablecoins, saying they will “bring a wave of technological innovation,” pointing to how they may allow users to avoid credit card fees and some of the other third-party fees which have historically been charged in the payments space. However, he was less optimistic about the prospects of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Scaramucci said he thinks CBDCs would be “too intrusive” from a privacy perspective, adding that he prefers dollar-based stablecoins. This is a view shared by his former boss, U.S. President Donald Trump.

New figures from the Central Statistics Office show that property prices registered monthly growth of 0.9% in June, the highest rate since November last year. Home prices across the country grew by 7.8% in the year to June, unchanged from the rate of growth the previous month, the CSO added. The CSO said the median price of a home purchased in June was €370,000. Today's figures show that property prices in Dublin - both houses and apartments - rose by 6.6% and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8% compared with June last year. In the 12 months to June, the highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 8% while both Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin saw a rise of 5.5%. Outside of Dublin, house prices were up by 9% and apartment prices rose by 6.6%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the West (Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon) at 10.3%, while at the other end of the scale, the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) saw a 7.1% rise. The CSO noted that the highest median price paid for a home was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000. The CSO said that Dublin residential property prices are 5.9% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 21.8% higher than their May 2007 peak. Today's figures also show that a total of 4,029 home purchases were filed with Revenue, an increase of 13.1% increase compared with the 3,563 purchases in June last year and a 5.4% increase compared with the 3,824 purchases in May. Existing homes accounted for 76.7% of the transactions filed in June, an increase of 8.2% compared with June 2024. The balance of 23.3% were new homes, which marked a rise of 32.9% on the same time last year.

Commenting on today's CSO figures, Dermot O'Leary, the chief economist of Goodbody's, said that price inflation trends overall are heavily influenced by the second-hand market due to the share of total transactions. "Second-hand price inflation has exceeded new home price inflation for the past five quarters, with inflation in the new homes sector now modestly below wage inflation after a spike in 2022/2023 as construction costs surged," he said. Trevor Grant, Chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, said that the continued uptick in the rate of annual house price inflation will be a disappointment for would-be house buyers as it means houses are becoming more unaffordable for many of them. He said that ultimately, the biggest driver of Irish house price inflation is the shortage of homes coupled with the pent-up demand for housing and an expanding population. Mr Grant noted that the recent 35% increase in housing completions is encouraging, but housing completions are still nowhere near where they need to be. "The shortage of new homes available to private buyers means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers/movers, which in turn is driving up second-hand prices. It's becoming increasingly common for properties to sell for 20% above the asking price," he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Could Rate Cuts Accelerate DeFi's $150 Billion Market?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/08/20/could-rate-cuts-accelerate-defis-150-billion-market/

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The math is irresistible again. In 2020, Treasuries paid just 0.5% while DeFi yielded 8%. Speculators piled in, and institutions began testing with early pilots. But when rates broke above 5% in 2022, the flow reversed back to Treasuries. Now, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, the yield equation is shifting again. When the Fed cuts, traditional yields compress. DeFi rates, by contrast, are set by supply and demand rather than central bank policy, making them largely insulated. As Treasuries fall, the relative gap between market-driven DeFi yields and risk-free rates widens, making DeFi attractive again. The rate environment is shifting. Markets assign 83% probability to Fed cuts beginning September 2025, while Goldman Sachs forecasts three quarter-point reductions by year-end. As traditional yields potentially compress toward 3–3.25%, DeFi's market-driven yields could once again offer compelling spreads. The question isn't whether this recreates 2020's conditions—it's whether institutions will respond more decisively this time, given the infrastructure improvements and regulatory clarity that have emerged since then. During 2022’s crypto winter, digital assets collapsed by over 90%, wiping out billions. Yet most DeFi protocols survived and kept functioning. The resilience was tested again in 2023: Silicon Valley Bank, the backbone of the tech ecosystem with $175 billion in deposits, collapsed in just 48 hours, trapping $3.3 billion of Circle’s USDC reserves and briefly depegging the stablecoin. Yet while banks froze, DeFi kept running, and USDC quickly regained its peg once the FDIC guaranteed deposits. Today, this ecosystem holds just under $150 billion in TVL (total value locked). The infrastructure has endured exchange implosions and regulatory crackdowns. DeFi’s resilience is drawing fresh institutional interest, with Wall Street now paying closer attention. JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman call this “Institutional DeFi”—a model that merges protocol innovation with traditional safeguards and could drive significant growth. At its core, DeFi replicates traditional financial services without banks or intermediaries. It rests on five major pillars: staking, lending, payments, tokenization, and yield farming. Together, these pillars form the architecture of decentralized markets and explain where activity and returns are concentrated. Locking or staking tokens on a blockchain secures the network and earns steady returns. It is the crypto equivalent of a CD (Certificate of Deposit), with instant settlement and non-custodial control. Rewards, drawn from transaction fees and newly issued tokens, flow to validators, the independent computers that secure the network, who then share payouts with stakers. In practice, it feels like interest income, but the source is the network itself rather than a bank. Ethereum staking currently pays 3–4% through mainstream providers, while Solana offers 5–8%. Beyond staking, stablecoin lending ranges from 4% to 9% depending on the platform. These yields are set by supply and demand in decentralized markets, not by central bank policy. Bitcoin's proof-of-work design limits native yield options, leaving most strategies focused on Ethereum and alternative chains. The staking landscape is crowded, with exchanges, enterprise players, and specialized providers competing for mandates. Coinbase and Kraken exemplify the exchange-led model, managing tens of billions and continuing to dominate retail flows. Pure-play providers like Figment (34% share) and Kiln (27%) compete on size and enterprise ties, layering in compliance, reporting, and onboarding to command large institutional mandates. Similar strategies are visible across Blockdaemon, which serves enterprise and developer ecosystems, and Stakefish, which caters to a global validator and delegator base. Among them, Chorus One makes staking simple and secure across 40+ networks with no custodial risk and minimal technical setup. Institutional-grade and ISO-certified, it supports Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and other major blockchains. The company optimizes returns through strategies developed by its quantitative research team, while users gain competitive rewards on their assets. This fragmented landscape highlights both opportunity and risk, as institutions weigh proven execution against marketing promises. If staking is the baseline, lending is the next layer, turning idle assets into active credit markets. In DeFi, lending and borrowing feel familiar, but the middleman is gone. Investors supply Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana through protocols like Aave and Compound. Borrowers post collateral directly on-chain, and smart contracts handle the rest. Rates rise when demand surges and fall when it cools. The most mature lending market revolves around dollar-pegged tokens. By lending USDC, USDT, or DAI, investors earn 4–9% yields, driven by constant demand for dollar liquidity. Returns come from borrowers paying interest, not the blockchain. In practice, it works like a global money market: programmable, transparent, and outside the banking system. If lending unlocks credit, stablecoins move the money itself. Stablecoins are no longer limited to lending; they are reshaping payments. Stripe and PayPal now extend crypto features to hundreds of millions of users, while Visa pilots USDC settlement and JPMorgan clears blockchain-based transactions through its Onyx network. These developments signal stablecoins’ entry into the financial mainstream. Behind the scenes, they already power the rails: USDT and USDC settle trillions of dollars on-chain each year, fueled by trading, remittances, and cross-border flows. Their biggest impact is emerging in cross-border payments, long plagued by high fees, delays, and limited access. Crypto-native companies are pushing into territory where traditional payments simply can't reach: peer-to-peer transactions. Kraken has launched Krak for crypto and fiat transfers across more than 100 countries. Another example, Paymento is rethinking crypto payments with a non-custodial gateway, where transactions settle wallet-to-wallet without third-party custody. It supports stablecoins across Bitcoin, Solana, EVM chains, and Tron. Freelancers can create payment links while merchants access plug-and-play integration with real-time settlement. Together, these efforts are shifting payments from bank-dependent rails to always-on, programmable networks. Execution is uneven, but adoption is accelerating. Illiquid assets are gaining liquidity. Real estate, commodities, and even invoices can be tokenized, and once digitized, they can trade around the clock on global networks while generating yield from their cash flows. The result is new liquidity from previously idle holdings. The market is scaling quickly. On-chain RWA (real-world asset) value surpassed $24 billion by mid-2025, nearly five times higher than three years ago. BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, now holds more than $12 billion across six blockchains. Polygon, Franklin Templeton, JPMorgan, and Avalanche with KKR are piloting tokenized Treasuries and funds. At the application layer, collaborative programs are emerging to support tokenized ventures. Haven1, a security-focused layer-1 for DeFi and real-world assets, and yard[hub]’s web3 Growth Camp accelerator have launched a joint program that combines Haven1’s next-generation infrastructure, technical support, and grants with yard[hub]’s venture-building expertise to provide a secure, compliance-aware environment for emerging DeFi and RWA projects from the outset. Despite this momentum, the gap between ambition and proven institutional adoption remains wide, and ultimate success will depend on execution rather than marketing. Yield farming means placing crypto into DeFi platforms as liquidity so others can trade, borrow, or lend. In return, investors earn a mix of trading fees and bonus tokens. It works like renting out your assets: rewards can be high, but they are risky since they depend on market activity and incentives that can shift quickly. Funds are usually flexible, though some platforms offer extra rewards for longer commitments. But whether staking, lending, or farming, none of it matters without secure storage and institutional-grade safeguards. On the consumer side, wallets have progressed from Trezor’s open-source devices for early adopters to Ledger’s millions of hardware units and MetaMask’s 100 million browser users. Each lowered barriers but stopped short of mass adoption. Tangem, a newer player in the crypto wallet industry, offers credit card-shaped devices and aims to onboard the next billion users by eliminating reliance on seed phrases. However, even with complexity out of the way, form factor alone cannot overcome user inertia and the broader challenges of education and trust that have long held back widespread adoption. At the institutional end, custody has matured into a layered system. Fireblocks, BitGo, and Coinbase Prime add safeguards like multi-signature security, compliance reporting, and insurance—bringing DeFi yields closer to fiduciary standards. They make staking, lending, and asset management viable at a scale regulators can live with. Regulation is catching up. Compliant, audited protocols are winning institutional approval, while experimental platforms face uncertainty. Europe’s MiCA rules and US stablecoin guidance raise costs but provide clarity. For institutions, the trade-off is simple: pay more for compliance and buy legitimacy, trust, and access to the market. These services effectively make digital asset management align with the expectations of traditional fiduciary oversight. The first wave of DeFi delivered both innovation and chaos. Many platforms kept customer funds in custody, allowing operators to rehypothecate—re-lend or make leveraged bets with user assets. When those bets went bad, the results were catastrophic. Terra Luna, Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager each collapsed almost overnight, erasing billions and shaking investor trust. The key distinction lies between truly decentralized protocols like Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and MakerDAO, which continued operating throughout the crisis, and centralized platforms that collapsed. Users keep control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code. User experience has leapt forward, too. What began with clunky browser extensions and jargon is now mobile-first, with fiat on-ramps, clean interfaces, and recovery via MPC or smart-contract wallets. The ecosystem has been stress-tested through brutal drawdowns and long crypto winters. Managing risk is central to any portfolio, and DeFi is no different. Investors must weigh not only macro and industry factors, but also risks unique to decentralized markets. Technical risk: DeFi hacks still cost millions every month, but platforms that undergo audits and offer bug bounties get hacked much less often. Market risk: Terra's 2022 implosion erased $60 billion in days and even shook Tether's peg—without circuit breakers, cascades spread instantly. Operational risk: Malicious insiders still pose threats—$95 million disappeared across 17 insider attacks in 2024. The crucial difference: non-custodial protocols eliminate the rehypothecation risk that destroyed Celsius and BlockFi. Users maintain control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code rather than human discretion. Regulatory uncertainty: Europe's MiCA framework went live in January 2025, requiring crypto service providers to obtain licenses or face an 18-month transition deadline. But Europe isn't done; targeted DeFi regulation is coming by 2026, though regulators still haven't defined what "decentralization" actually means. Meanwhile, US regulatory clarity remains fragmented despite new pro-crypto leadership, creating a compliance maze for institutions operating globally. Remember: if you can't identify the source of exceptional returns, you probably haven't identified the risk. Unlike traditional banking institutions, DeFi protocols can't call the Federal Reserve for emergency liquidity. When markets freeze and there's no backstop, cascades can turn into floods instantly, triggering catastrophic collapse. As Fed cuts squeeze traditional yields, DeFi’s yields could offer a 200–400 basis point premium over Treasuries. Institutional DeFi could represent a structural source of alpha, albeit with higher risk, built on infrastructure that has survived stress tests and reinforced by regulatory frameworks now crystallizing. For institutional portfolios, this creates three actionable opportunities: infrastructure exposure through vetted staking and custody providers; yield enhancement via compliant protocols offering market-driven returns; and early positioning in the payment rails that will underpin tomorrow’s financial system. ‘We’ve been emphasizing for years the need for the large institutional market, where most of the world’s value currently resides, to flow into the blockchain industry. We’re now helping facilitate this shift in a reliable, technical, and secure way,’ said Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink. With nearly $150 billion already locked, the rails are in place. The question is not if institutions will step in, but how quickly they will build the conviction to do so. Disclosure: The companies mentioned represent examples of different strategic approaches within each infrastructure category. Inclusion does not constitute endorsement, and institutional adoption timelines across all providers remain uncertain.

Title: Property values up 8pc in June as prices have now risen for almost two years

Not enough homes are being built to satisfy demand. Property prices rose again in June, with the cost of homes going up every month now for close to two years. Prices were up by 7.8pc in the year to June, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. This the same rate of property-price inflation that was recorded in May. New CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie, which found that Irish house price inflation has reached a 10-year-high. In the year to June, the typical, or median, price of a home was €370,000, the same figure that was recorded in the previous month. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since June last year. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in that prices have risen, putting huge squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing by more than double those of new homes. A chronic shortage of new homes to buy means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers and movers. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period up to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June 2025, 4,029 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These purchases were made up of 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices were the West, consisting of Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, at 10.3pc The Midlands saw price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the South-East area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford, saw a 7.1pc rise in house prices. Senior underwriter at Núa Money Donal Magee said: “House price inflation continues to pick up in Ireland, which has increased by 7.8pc in past 12 months to June 2025.” He said this means many people will continue struggle to buy a home. Recently, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Should financial advisors and their clients follow the “smart money?” Recently, Ivy League schools including Harvard University and Brown University have disclosed that they are among the numerous institutional investors with allocations to bitcoin ETFs. That trend is further legitimizing crypto as an asset class and may have some individual investors wondering if they, too, should bank on bitcoin. Financial advisors have different stances on whether (and how much) clients should allocate to the highly volatile category, but they agree that it should be approached with caution. For example, most of AE Advisors’ clients have 5% to 10% allocated to Bitcoin via spot-price ETFs or digital custodians, president Mike Casey said. But Casey, who said he was among the first CFPs to recommend bitcoin allocations as far back as 2019, added, “please keep in mind that bitcoin has substantially more market cap and mainstream adoption than the other crypto tokens, which are still generally speculative in nature.” Retail demand is obviously there for spot crypto products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETFs (IBIT), which is approaching $90 billion in assets. But the extent to which advisors use certain products is influenced in part by their inclusion in model portfolios — and spot crypto ETFs are almost nonexistent there. “BlackRock is really the only one we’ve seen going forward with adding it into its model portfolios,” said Cindy Zarker, relationship manager at Fuse Research Network. “All of this is changing. You have a lot of firms that have various digital-asset offerings, and they’re promoting those offerings and how they can benefit a portfolio.” There are signs that digital assets are maturing, said Clark Randall, director of financial planning at Creekmur Wealth Advisors. Those include BlackRock’s launch of IBIT and Congressional passage last month of the Genius Act, he said. “In addition, research has shown that including an allocation of up to 7% in Bitcoin can improve the risk-adjusted return of a diversified investment portfolio.” Still, if more advisors are bullish on Bitcoin, it’s a new phenomenon. Data from a survey last year published by Fuse show: Time for Class: “Institutional interest from endowments and other large investors lends credibility to the ETF structure because it is regulated, custodied and easy to report for taxes,” said Jared Gagne, private wealth manager at Claro Advisors. “It does not make crypto less volatile. In wealth management, that distinction matters.” Institutions have more time to weather that volatility than individuals, and allocations for clients should be satellite holdings at most, said Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning. “The average individual investor can’t invest with a truly infinite time horizon and is more exposed to urgent liquidity needs, emotional stress and the risk that riding out a 70% crypto correction isn’t just uncomfortable, but catastrophic to their plans.” ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. Investments in AI infrastructure are set to take off in the next decade, and more ETFs are focusing on that. Finance pros say US stock prices are higher than they should be, but that may have a lot to do with the biggest names in the S&P 500. The past year hammered active funds, and while a few categories show long-term promise, success is out of reach for most, per Morningstar. The agency declared it is hands-off for liquid staking in some cases, which could eventually help crypto ETFs benefit from proof-of-stake. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, a standard ETF portfolio may not cut it. A backlash to so-called woke investments spurred interest in their anti-woke counterparts. But is it a new strategy or just marketing hype? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Nvidia, Palantir and other superstar AI stocks are dragging Wall Street lower again NEW YORK -- Nvidia, Palantir and other superstar stocks that surged in the mania surrounding artificial-intelligence technology are dragging Wall Street lower again on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and was on track for a fourth straight loss after setting an all-time high last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 132 points, or 0.3%, as of 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% lower. Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into AI, dropped 3% and was on track to be the heaviest weight on Wall Street for a second straight day following its 3.5% fall on Tuesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, sank 8.1% to add to its 9.4% loss from the day before. One possible contributor to the swoon was a study from MIT's Nanda Initiative that warned most corporations are not yet seeing any measurable return from their generative AI investments, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. But such stocks have also been facing criticism for a while that their stock prices simply shot too high, too fast amid the furor around AI and became too expensive. Nvidia, whose profit report scheduled for next week is one of Wall Street's next major events, had soared 35.5% for the year so far before Tuesday. Palantir had surged even more, more than doubling. The tech stocks still have supporters, though, who say AI will bring the next generational revolution in business. Mixed profit reports from big U.S. retailers helped keep the rest of the market in check, and nearly as many stocks rose in the S&P 500 index as fell. TJX, the company behind the TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores, climbed 4.6% after beating analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue. It also raised its forecast for profit over its full fiscal year, while CEO Ernie Herrman said TJX is seeing “strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses” and that its current quarter is off to a strong start. Lowe’s added 0.2% after the home-improvement retailer delivered a profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. It also said it agreed to buy Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, ceiling systems and other interior building products, for about $8.8 billion. Target, meanwhile, tumbled 8.1% even though it edged past analysts’ expectations for profit in the spring. The struggling retailer said that CEO Brian Cornell plans to step down Feb. 1 and that an insider, 20-year veteran Michael Fiddelke, will replace him. He helped reenergize the company, but it has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive post-COVID retail landscape. Estee Lauder dropped 4.9% after offering a forecast for profit this upcoming fiscal year that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. The beauty company said it expects tariffs to shave roughly $100 million off its upcoming earnings. La-Z-Boy sank 11.5% after the furniture maker’s profit and revenue for the spring came up shy of analysts’ expectations. CEO Melinda Whittington said it’s contending with “soft industry demand” and that it’s looking at potential alternatives “to address financial pressure from non-core’ parts” of its business. The week’s biggest news for Wall Street is likely arriving on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give a highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The setting has been home to big policy announcements from the Fed in the past, and the hope on Wall Street is that Powell will hint that an interest rate cut is coming soon. The Fed has kept its main interest rate steady this year, primarily because of the fear of the possibility that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push inflation higher. But a surprisingly weak report on job growth across the country may be superseding that. Treasury yields have come down sharply on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.29% from 4.30% late Tuesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. London’s FTSE 100 rose 1.1% despite a report that said inflation in the U.K. rose more than expected through July, in part due to soaring airfares and food prices. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.5% after Japan reported that its exports fell slightly more than expected in July, pressured by higher tariffs on goods shipped to the U.S. Imports also fell from a year ago. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.2%. Shares that trade there of Chinese toy company Pop Mart International Group soared 12.5% after its CEO said its annual revenue could top $4 billion this year and announced the release of a mini version of its popular Labubu dolls. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

While cryptocurrencies retreated from their recent peaks, Anthony Scaramucci’s alternative investment company, SkyBridge Capital, supercharged Avalanche’s (AVAX) fundamentals. According to the latest press release, SkyBridge plans to tokenize hedge funds worth $300 million on the Avalanche network. Under this initiative, SkyBridge’s Legion Strategies Ltd. and Digital Macro Masfer Fund Ltd. will tokenize on AVAX’s network through leading financial service providers Apex Group and Tokeny. Commenting on the move, SkyBridge’s CEO and founder, Anthony Scaramucci, stated: Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors. The news renewed sentiments around AVAX’s potential amidst the ongoing broad market bloodbath. Digital assets trade in the red as Bitcoin falls below $114,000. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish, perceiving the current correction as a healthy one after BTC’s surge to all-time highs of around $124,000. With large-cap altcoins in the traders’ radar after the recent Ethereum rally, this article checks AVAX’s potential comeback once market sentiments improve. The real-world assets (RWAs) sector is experiencing significant growth momentum as DeFi and TradFi converge. Hedge fund tokenization will enrich Avalance’s ecosystem, as it already hosts tokenized credit, stocks, private equity, venture, and MMFs. Avalanche already hosts tokenized MMFs, private equity, credit, stocks, venture & now hedge funds. Tokenization on Avalanche is bridging TradFi and DeFi with new distribution channels and programmable products. 🔺 This is where capital connects. https://t.co/vEZbo1c4ft — Avalanche🔺 (@avax) August 19, 2025 SkyBridge decision sets AVAX for impressive performance in the coming sessions. The price chart supports a bullish case, pointing to a potential AVAX recovery to $32. That would mean an over 45% gain from the altcoin’s current price. Financial institutions are never random when venturing into crypto. Avalanche’s EVM compatibility, near-instant finality, and scalability likely attracted SkyBridge. The $300 million initiative unlocks the AVAX platform for large-scale tokenization. According to Tokeny co-founder Danie Coheur: SkyBridge’s tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it’s happening. While the tokenization updates strengthen Avalanche’s fundamentals, broad market weakness weighs on AVAX’s performance. The alt hovers at $22 after losing around 1.80% in the past 24 hours. AVAX remained relatively calm as markets crashed ahead of Powell’s anticipated speech. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks poised to lead the next leg up, fueled by institutional interest, especially if SkyBridge succeeds in its plans. Such a narrative aligns with the bullish chart pattern. The Elliot Wave analysis shows that AVAX is finalizing a wave two correction. This setup phase often precedes a massive wave three rally. The structure highlights possibilities of recoveries to the $32 ceiling. That would be an approximately 45% surge from AVAX’s market price. However, improved broader market sentiments remain vital to support the upside. Failure to overcome the obstacle between $26 and $27 will likely delay the projected AVAX recovery.

Justine Moore and Alex Rampell The internet’s most profitable business model has always been simple: running search ads on monetizable queries. When you search “how many protons are in a cesium atom,” Google makes no money. When you search “best tennis racket,” it prints cash. This asymmetry defines the entire search economy–some queries are pure curiosity, and others have direct purchase intent. It’s part of why Google (where people often search for products) is a $2T company and Wikipedia (where people search for knowledge or fun facts) is a non-profit. Google could lose 95% of search volume and still grow revenue –as long as it retains the valuable queries, which are largely commerce related. Has Google managed to keep these searches from moving to AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity? Maybe. In May 2025, Apple SVP Eddy Cue testified during the DOJ’s antitrust trial that Safari search volume had declined for the first time in over two decades. The result? Alphabet’s stock dropped nearly 8% in a day, wiping out over $150 billion in market cap — all from the hint that queries might be leaking to AI. But fast forward to Google’s increasing revenue (including from search!) and it’s pretty clear (squaring Eddy Cue’s comments with Google’s Q2 earnings) that Google is likely only losing low-monetizing queries, at least for now. AI is eating the low-value (at least in “cost-per-click terms”) queries first, the ones with no commercial intent that are more informational. If language models answer your cesium question, Google loses the query but not a dime. The revenue remains until AI starts replacing things like “best X for Y” commerce journeys — the ones with actual purchase intent. There’s no question this is about to happen, but not all commerce is the same. Some commerce will be eaten by AI, some will be immune to it, and some will be up for grabs by new startups. We can split purchases into five rough categories, ordered by level of consideration: There’s a sixth category here that we won’t cover in detail in this post, because the purchase behavior is idiosyncratic. This is aspirational purchases – things you dream about buying once you get that promotion, or that you spend months (or years) saving up for. Depending on your income level, these purchases could be many things: a luxury handbag, a sports car, a vacation home. Each of these journeys is likely different. But it’s possible that AI agents help a consumer pick the exact SKU they want to buy or track prices / availability. How will AI play a role? We expect that AI will impact each type of purchase – but in vastly different ways. To start, we’ll dive into how shopping behaviors were impacted by the Internet and then speculate on what they might look like in the age of AI. A bit more detail on how AI could impact each category, and early examples of products we’ve seen here: 1. Impulse buys – the nature of an impulse buy means that you won’t be doing research in advance or consulting with an expert, so there’s limited opportunity for AI agents to play a role. However, the algorithms that guide your attention will continue to improve, enabling advertisers to target you with the right product at the right time. And it will be easier for brands to create hyper-personalized marketing materials that draw you in. For example, imagine watching an IG Reel about Mothers’ Day gifts and then immediately getting an ad for a candle engraved with her name. This type of image customization is now simple (and relatively cheap) to do at scale. 2. Routine essentials – you probably already have brands and SKUs that you know and love when it comes to everyday essentials, so an AI research agent won’t be particularly helpful unless you’re adding a new product to the lineup (like if you get a dog and need to pick their food). But AI should play a role when it comes to sourcing and purchasing items. For example, if you regularly get the same laundry detergent, your AI agent could monitor and buy on your behalf if the price dips below a certain level (especially if it knows that based on your past purchase patterns, you’ll need new detergent in the next few weeks). Tools like camelcamelcamel allow you to set price watches on Amazon products and notify you if there’s a great deal. The next step of this could be agentic purchasing on your behalf, particularly across retailers. 3. Lifestyle purchases – when you’re purchasing items that you don’t buy regularly (especially if they’re a bit more spendy, like a luxury handbag), you’re likely going to want to evaluate various options to make sure you’re picking the best one. But researching and aggregating the choices, and ranking them across various criteria, is time-consuming. Imagine deputizing an AI agent to do the grunt work for you and come back with a recommendation that explains why a specific SKU is the perfect choice for you based on your past purchases, what it knows about your preferences, and even things like your body type and what colors look best with your eyes. We’re starting to see early examples of this with products like Plush, which enables you to search for women’s fashion items, but we expect to see tools here that do deeper research across more options. 4. Functional purchases – these items are important because they are typically (1) a meaningful financial investment, and (2) a product you’ll use every day, likely over several years. This means that you want to feel very confident that the product meets your needs and will hold up over time. You may feel comfortable purchasing a product that your AI research agent recommends. But you’ll likely want to have a more in-depth conversation with a subject-matter expert (an AI “consultant”) about different options, with a phone or video call that allows you to explain your needs in further detail and answer follow-up questions. Some retailers / brands offer this on their website already, but it’s limited to their SKUs. We see an opportunity for AI consultants that have deep knowledge on a product category across different brands, and that learn more context on each user and their preferences over time (for example, if it helps you buy a sofa, it can later tailor chair recommendations to things that match). 5. Life purchases – there are only a few “life purchases” you’ll make (e.g. a home, car, wedding, or college education). These are expensive and meaningful, so you’ll likely spend months – if not years – evaluating options. You’ll do your own research online, but there’s a decent chance that you’ll also speak with experts and try out the options (e.g. touring wedding venues or homes, test driving a car, visiting a college). It’s hard to imagine people fully outsourcing these decisions to AI. But it’s likely that an AI coach will guide you through the process of choosing – from researching the initial set of options to evaluating the pros & cons to negotiating terms or reviewing contracts (we already see founders sending us term sheets marked up by Claude). You may have noticed a few categories of spend that we largely aren’t included in our examples here: food, travel, and healthcare. Food and travel vary by person, so it’s hard to bucket them into one category. For one person, a nice meal at a restaurant or a weekend trip is a routine purchase that doesn’t require meaningful research. For another, it’s a splurge (and an opportunity for an AI research agent to play a role). Due to the fact that most healthcare expenses are largely out of a person’s control, it’s a bit more complicated to categorize them. We’ll leave this to another post, but suffice it to say that there’s no shortage of opportunities to direct patients to better treatments / doctors / procedures with AI. Google isn’t the only major commerce platform that could be disrupted by AI. Amazon and Shopify are also at risk – but they sit much closer to the point of purchase than Google. They monetize not just intent but action, and increasingly, repeat behavior. Amazon owns search, delivery, reorder data, and (quite importantly) reviews. It is an integrated commerce stack. While search can effectively disintermediate Amazon, Amazon itself serves as a search engine for commerce with an embedded loyalty program (Amazon Prime) boasting hundreds of millions of subscribers. Shopify powers the merchant side: hosting SKUs, facilitating checkout, and enabling direct-to-consumer brands. Through Shop Pay and the Shop App, it’s now building a consumer-side wedge too. As agents become the new interface for buying, both platforms are well-positioned — Amazon with end-to-end control, Shopify perhaps more so with distributed ownership across millions of stores and growing consumer touchpoints. It doesn’t matter if a consumer search starts with Google or ChatGPT if the destination merchant is hosted by Shopify. Google could, of course, use its considerable distribution and technical prowess (not to mention “payment credential” prowess with GooglePay) to play offense, purposefully routing more commerce searches in an AI first way, or even making a “CamelCamelCamel x AI” new purchasing app. AI agents can’t fulfill their potential in commerce without major shifts in the substrate they operate on. In particular: 1. Better data: AI’s potential is first and foremost bottlenecked by content, not compute. Most product reviews are noisy, gamed, or overly polarized. Agents need access to structured, trustworthy, real-time feedback. Let’s say you’re looking for the “best” blender. In a perfect world, your AI would order every blender, test them all for a week in your kitchen (with your home robot!), decide which one you like best, and then send the rest back. But today AI just summarizes the web, and cannot turn shilled junk into honest analysis. 2. Unified APIs: To move from recommendations to transactions, agents must be able to interface cleanly across retail platforms. This starts with agents being able to pull accurate data on products (like the most up-to-date price and what’s in stock), and extends to being able to add things to cart and eventually checking out on the user’s behalf. 3. Identity and memory: Agents that understand your preferences, past purchases, and deal thresholds (a la CamelCamelCamel) can automate routine buying and curate lifestyle decisions. This is an interesting challenge, because preferences change over time and also vary by type of purchase – for example, you might like to splurge on flights but want to buy lower-price daily essentials. Or you might frequently return cotton sweaters but never their wool counterparts. So this memory must be dynamic and multi-faceted. 4. Embedded capture: The best AI-native experiences will capture data directly in the user journey that contributes to better recommendations. Imagine an AI agent that infers information about what to recommend to you (or others) from data that’s not typically present on product description pages or reviews. This could be direct (e.g. next time you open the app, it asks you a few specific questions about your last purchase), or more passive (e.g. it looks at how long you linger on a specific item or feature and maybe even asks follow-ups if you’re hesitating). Until these foundations are in place, LLMs will remain clever summarizers — not true commercial agents.

I love you, BUT I’m not “in love” with you. You don’t have to go home, BUT you can’t stay here. You may continue fighting, Martial Law President Zelensky, BUT the American people won’t be following you into World War III. No matter how agreeable the first half of a sentence might sound, the “buts” change everything on a dime. President Trump has been clear that he wants the Russia-Ukraine War to end, but he says Zelensky must choose to end the conflict. When the war began, 73% of Ukrainians wanted to fight Russia until Ukraine secured victory, but 69% now want the war to end as soon as possible through negotiations! Perhaps that is why Z-Man agreed to meet President Trump in D.C. It was widely rumored that U.S. officials encouraged the battledress-wearing comedian to don a real suit for the occasion, but the holdover-president wore a military-style jacket in all black. The guy who plays piano with his penis still looks out of his element at the White House, but he does dress like someone attending his own funeral. With the titular head of the Ukrainian government back at the White House — surrounded by an entourage of European honchos eager to butt in — we will finally discover whether some kind of peace between Russia and Ukraine is tenable. To be sure, there are many powerful people in the United States and across Europe who would prefer to keep Ukraine a battlefield for years to come. Why? As a man holding onto the presidency eighteen months beyond his elected term, Zelensky might finally bring peace to his war-torn country, but he will likely be voted out of office once the exigencies of martial law disappear. U.K. prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen may publicly express their desire for lasting European peace, but the Russian bogeyman has long been the perfect scapegoat and distraction for European societies self-immolating from mass immigration, censorship, and “climate change” communism. The World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and other august organizations ostensibly dedicated to global welfare might applaud an end to bloodshed, but all of their depopulation enthusiasts will no doubt regret the loss of a conflict zone chalking up more deaths than births. BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other international investment houses will be happy to make money from lucrative rebuilding projects in Ukraine, but they will lament that the war did not topple President Putin and open up Russian lands to their profit-seeking conquest. Weapons manufacturers will be glad to have so much demand from American and European militaries desperate to restock munitions after years of supplying Ukraine, but their boards of directors will be busy finding new places around the globe to slaughter in the cutthroat business of war. So there may well be happy faces and cheers over the next few days and weeks when it comes to the prospect of Ukrainian peace, but there will be plenty of villains scowling behind the scenes — all hoping that the tentative peace breaks and the carnage resumes. Those European and Chinese power-players who have long seen war between the Russian Federation and the United States as an opportunity to diminish both countries simultaneously will say all the right things in upbeat social media postings praising compromise, but they will regret that the America-last Biden administration is no longer around to stumble recklessly into nuclear war. Spy agencies across the West may pause their “color revolution” activities long enough to install a new Ukrainian puppet into the presidency, but they will continue their hybrid warfare operations in former Warsaw Pact countries. London and New York City bankers will perhaps allow Russian citizens to access their overseas assets once again, but Western central banks will pursue monetary policies that cause enough domestic turmoil in target countries to return the West to a state of war in the near future. In sound bites, everyone loves peace, but in the world of big business, war means profits. War is big business, but it is also a convenient political distraction. During the destructive interregnum of the Biden installation, Democrats laundered trillions of dollars in “Green New Deal” spending through the Build Back Better Act (cynically relabeled the Inflation Reduction Act to appeal to idiotic members of the press). While that legislation stole from taxpayers and accomplished nothing for the American people, it put enormous sums of money into the bank accounts of Democrat-run NGOs structured as “social justice” and “environmental justice” front groups. Combined with Democrats’ ongoing war against inexpensive hydrocarbon energies, the inflation-triggering money-printing of that harmful legislative handout to Establishment insiders and crony capitalists doubled grocery prices in the United States. How did Democrats explain away their disastrous handling of the economy to struggling American families? They simply blamed Russia (as they have for the last decade) and called the spike in the cost of living “Putin’s price hike.” Sure, the cost of food, fuel, and basic necessities rose precipitously during the bungling Biden administration, but Russia, Russia, Russia! Americans were even encouraged to view their growing household bills as a patriotic form of suffering worth enduring in America’s undeclared alliance with Ukraine against the Russian Federation. First, Democrats blamed Hillary’s 2016 election loss on imaginary Russian bots and contrived Russian collusion. Then they blamed the massive spike in prices on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Europe has played the same cynical game against its citizens. Instead of admitting that “green energy” totalitarianism is destroying the continent’s industrial competitiveness and household wealth, mendacious politicians blame the War in Ukraine for their crumbling economies. Of course, the rise in energy costs across Europe might also have something to do with ineffective sanctions against Russian energy companies (that merely divert Russian products to China and the greater Global South); the convenient sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines; and Ukraine’s military attacks on key pipelines transporting oil and natural gas from Russia to households in Hungary, Slovakia, and other parts of Europe. The more expensive ordinary goods become, the louder Eurocrats insist that the problem is not “green energy”–induced inflation but rather Russia’s war in Ukraine! For European politicians, the Russia-Ukraine War supplies many ancillary benefits. It provides already indebted nations an excuse to borrow more money for defense spending. It creates a common enemy for the European Commission to exploit as a life-and-death reason for member states to relinquish national sovereignty. It creates a distraction from the rising frequency of social conflicts related to rampant illegal immigration. It provides a pretext for canceling inconvenient election results in Romania and designating popular political parties as national security threats. It allows the prevailing Establishment to entrench its control over the European bureaucracy. As Democrats in America and socialists in Europe are fond of whispering, Never let a crisis go to waste. Turning Russia into an irredeemable bugaboo and Ukraine into some saintly bastion of “democracy” worthy of every European’s sacrifice is how we have gotten to the point when all of Europe’s problems are brushed aside. Serious people may be warning about a looming civil war in the United Kingdom, but Ukraine’s territorial integrity is all that matters. Churches in France may be burning down for unexplained reasons, but Russians are the real threat. The German economy may be fundamentally unsound, but military spending will create jobs. Americans and Europeans should want the killing in Ukraine to end, but there are just so many politicians and bankers who find that outcome disappointing. In all likelihood, this war would have continued for many more years. But, thankfully, the American people elected President Trump. Hat tip to Megan Draper, M.S. Image via Raw Pixel.

Title: Citizenship Chief Says Federal Work Permits for Foreign Grads Are 'Depressing Wages'

Full Content:
President Joe Biden’s pro-migration deputies allowed at least 400,000 foreign students at U.S. colleges to take U.S. white-collar jobs in 2024. Biden’s 400,000 giveaway in 2024 was a huge 45 percent jump from the 275,000 job approvals by President Donald Trump’s deputies in 2020. Trump’s deputies had pushed the giveaways down by 7 percent from President Barack Obama’s 294,000 giveaways in 2016. “I think it’s depressing wages, and it’s something that we need to be concerned about,” said Joe Edlow, who is President Donald Trump’s director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service agency. The agency is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Edlow told Breitbart News on August 11 that the OPT program “has been one of the largest programs used to get around H-1B [visa] requirement caps, to hire aliens who are graduating with STEM degrees in a way that makes me concerned that the US students coming out of the same universities are not necessarily able to find [jobs].” Biden’s giveaway gives work permits to roughly one foreign graduate for every two Americans who graduate with a high-tech degree in 2024. That flood of job-seeking foreign graduates sweeps many young American graduates into less productive and lower-pay careers in 2025. The OPT and CPT Programs The jobs giveaway is conducted via President George W. Bush’s 2008 Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. His deputies invented the program without any congressional approval and even granted employers a tax break if they hire foreigners who graduate from American universities instead of Americans who graduate from those universities. Bush’s OPT program provides one-year work permits to foreign graduates, and an extra two years of work permits to people who graduate from Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics courses. In 2024, roughly 640,000 foreign students and graduates had approval to get work permits, including the 400,000 who reported that they had started work. Many of the foreigners are quickly hired into career-track jobs via discriminatory, ethnic-hiring networks in Fortune 500 companies. These ethnic hiring networks are rooted in foreign countries — such as India — but are rarely noticed by the Justice Department’s employment and civil rights lawyers. The number of employed foreign students is uncertain because some use the program to get fake jobs so they can remain in the United States. The similar Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program provides one-year work permits to foreigners who are enrolled in U.S. universities. The J-1 program is also used to get many foreign students into STEM jobs in university laboratories and elsewhere. The programs also provide an on-ramp to the H-1B visa program for up to perhaps 150,000 foreign white-collar workers each year. Employers like the H-1B program because it allows them to reward favored and subservient foreign workers by nominating them for the massively valuable prize of U.S. citizenship. The prize is a huge incentive for foreign workers, and it costs little or nothing to the employers. Instead, the prize is funded by the American citizens who are forced to share their political power with the migrants who took their salaries and careers. The OPT, CPT, J-1, and H-1B programs delivered roughly 400,000 new foreign graduates into U.S. jobs in 2024, even as roughly 700,000 Americans graduated from four-year colleges with degrees in STEM, health care, and business. The foreign graduates and students are hired in vast numbers by elite companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Goldman Sachs, Intel, Walmart, Apple, Tesla, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase. But huge numbers of the OPT students are steered into software sweatshops to work as outsourced subcontractors for the Fortune 500. Those jobs were formerly within the Fortune 500, and were the career-starters for the many young Americans who subsequently became experts, managers, executives, and entrepreneurs. The result is that many promising American graduates are being permanently sidelined by the Bush programs, even as artificial intelligence technologies eliminate many starter jobs. The New York Times reported on August 10: “I just graduated with a computer science degree, and the only company that has called me for an interview is Chipotle,” Ms. Mishra said in a get-ready-with-me TikTok video this summer that has since racked up more than 147,000 views. “I’m very concerned,” Jeff Forbes, the former program director for computer science education and workforce development at the National Science Foundation, told the New York Times. “Computer science students who graduated three or four years ago would have been fighting off offers from top firms — and now that same student would be struggling to get a job from anyone.” “What’s happening in America right now is young people are having increased difficulties finding jobs, finding work in their career fields, and specifically STEM fields, tech fields,” said Gabe Guidarini, a politics student and Republican organizer at the University of Dayton, Ohio. He added: [U.S. graduates] may not know the [OPT] policy behind what they’re seeing in their everyday lives. But they are feeling the effects of it, especially engineering and STEM grads who are having a ton of difficulty finding work and being able to secure employment in the field that they spent tens of thousands dollars to get a degree.” We’re seeing a lot of people, especially within the Republican Party and the conservative movement, start taking up this issue. In Ohio, he said, the Chinese-run Fuyao Glass business in Ohio used the H-1B program to import Chinese specialists instead of hiring local American graduates. “I think it’s a core issue for young people and the middle class,” Guidarini said: It impacts their everyday lives. It impacts their livelihoods. It impacts their ability to find a job, and as a result, to buy a home, to raise kids, to have a good quality of living. That’s a huge issue for us young people, and the party that is increasingly talking about it is the Republican Party. The huge inflow of foreign graduates into white-collar careers is also cracking the foundations of national strength by wrecking professionalism, innovation, privacy, and national security. Many young American graduates are using Twitter and TikTok to describe their dire economic situation as business officials try to blame the lack of opportunities and the layoffs on Artificial Intelligence. Policy Disagreements Officials in Trump’s administration are arguing over the visa programs — including OPT, H-1B, H4EAD, J-1, L-1, and E-2 visas. The different views are visible at the Department of Justice, Edlow’s Department of Homeland Security, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Education, the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Federal Reserve, and within Trump’s economic strategy and among his Silicon Valley advisors. The controversy is also splitting Trump’s supporters from his business allies. “I need partners,” Edlow told Breitbart News, adding: I need the Department of Labor to work with me. I need the Department of Education — if it still exists — to work with me. We’ve got to do everything we can to really make it abundantly difficult — only in certain situations — for [foreign] students to think that they are just going to continue to live and work in the United States beyond the expiration of their [F-1 student] visa. Because, as far as I’m concerned, and I am right — OPT is not a statutory program. There is no statutory basis [from Congress] for OPT. It is a program based in regulation. Now, do I think it needs to go away completely? Maybe not. Reporters should help government officials study in the program, said Edlow. But the program is strongly supported by the universities that trade the OPT work permits for tuition fees, by hiring managers in many Fortune 500 companies, and by stock-maximizing investors. The work-permit programs are also backed by India’s government, which gains huge wealth from remittances when Indians migrate to well-paying jobs throughout the United States. In 2024, almost 80,000 Indians were given the multi-year STEM OPT permits. The U.S.-India trade talks are stalled partly because of the economic impact of the visa programs on Americans. Indian migrants tell Indian media outlets that they are worried that Trump and his deputies will investigate visa fraud by Indian-owned companies. For example, some companies sell fake jobs to wealthy migrants who exploit the OPT program to stay in the United States: Students in the U.S. on Optional Practical Training (OPT) are facing fresh uncertainty as authorities step up action against job consultancies [subcontractors]. These firms, which previously kept students nominally employed by issuing fake payslips and payroll records without providing real work, are now under stricter oversight. … “It’s terrifying,” a 26-year-old postgraduate student from Hyderabad, currently residing in Houston, told The Times of India. “I was told I had an {OPT] ‘employer’ and was receiving pay stubs, but now they’ve stopped. I don’t know what to do; finding real work at short notice is almost impossible.” Another 25-year-old from the city, currently staying in Virginia, shared how the fabricated payroll had kept him afloat in the US. “I’ve been paying thousands in rent and tuition under the assumption that my paperwork was in order. Now I’m scrambling, with less than two months to find something genuine. I’m now looking for trustworthy consultancies.” “We need to study [OPT],” Edlow told Breitbart News. “We’ve got to … make sure that we’re keeping not only the employers honest, but also the [foreign] students who are utilizing it honest.” “I hope you [in the media] hold the other people who have control over this issue as accountable,” he added. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

If you opt for the digital edition, just be aware that the download size is currently estimated at 25GB, which is over 10% of the Switch 2's usable storage space. Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World $79 | Releases August 28 If you're worried about storage space for the digital version of Air Riders, you can double your Switch 2 storage for $35.77 with the Walmart-exclusive Onn 256GB microSD Express Card. The officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express is in stock for $59 at Walmart. Kirby Air Riders is developed by Bandai Namco and Sora Ltd, the independent studio helmed by Masahiro Sakurai. These days, Sakurai is best known as the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, but he's also the creator of the Kirby franchise. Kirby Air Riders is the first game in the series directed by Sakurai since Kirby Air Ride. Since Kirby is in every Smash Bros. game, Sakurai has never truly left the character behind, but he hasn't worked on a dedicated Kirby game since supervising the 2004 Game Boy Advance metroidvania Kirby & the Amazing Mirror. The Mario Kart-esque racing game expands marquee modes from Kirby Air Ride and adds new ones. The controversial single-button control scheme from the original has been replaced by a two-button layout where B is for boosting and Y activates special moves, perform tricks, and switch machines. New abilities and characters have been added to the roster. Along with Kirby, you'll be able to play as King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, Cappy, Starman, Chef Kawasaki, Magolor, Gooey, Susie, and Knuckle Joe. The main game mode from the original, City Trial, is back with a bevy of new features. This time around, you'll be tasked with finding machine upgrades scattered across a large floating island. You only have five minutes to secure your upgrades before heading to the Stadium to compete against computer players or friends in races and battles. Kirby Air Riders supports local multiplayer for up to four players on one console and eight players wirelessly. Switch Online members can compete in online events for up to 16 players. Need extra Joy-Con Controllers for multiplayer? Amazon has Switch 2 Joy-Con 2-Packs for $95 (was $100). Nintendo Switch 2 - Joy-Con 2 (2-Pack) $95 (was $100) at Amazon Kirby Air Riders' $70 price point matches other recent and upcoming Switch 2 titles, including Donkey Kong Bananza and Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is scheduled to launch in October. Outside of Mario Kart World, the only $80 Switch 2 games so far are updated versions of original Switch exclusives with new content. Notably, this includes Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World, the Switch 2-exclusive version of the superb 3D platformer. Along with overhauled graphics, the Switch 2 Edition has the new Star-Crossed World story campaign. You're essentially paying for the $60 base game and the new $20 DLC as a bundle, so the comparison to Kirby Air Riders isn't exactly 1:1. If you're looking forward to Kirby Air Riders and want to spend some time with the series before its November release, there are plenty of options on Nintendo Switch. In addition to Forgotten Land--the first 3D platformer for the franchise--there are two traditional side-scrolling-platformers with physical editions: Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe and Kirby Star Allies. Kirby has also starred in multiple digital-only Switch games and numerous classic titles are on Nintendo Switch Online. One of the best Kirby spin-offs in recent years is Kirby's Dream Buffet ($15), which also happened to inspire a couple of the cutest Club Mocchi-Mocchi Kirby plushies around. If you're interested in the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Forgotten Land, existing owners can buy the DLC and upgrade for $20. Newcomers can also save $15 by picking up the Switch edition and Star-Crossed World separately. Multiple of the best Kirby game deals right now are for UK editions at Amazon-owned retailer Woot. Switch consoles can play games from any region, so the only difference with these Kirby games is the ratings board logo on the cover is PEGI instead of ESRB.

Wall Street faded on Tuesday following drops for Nvidia and other stars that have been riding the mania surrounding artificial intelligence technology. The Dow rose 10.45 points, or less than 0.1%, to 44,922.27. The S&P 500 fell 37.78 points, or 0.6%, to 6,411.37. The Nasdaq fell 314.82 points, or 1.5%, to 21,314.95. The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI, the AP reports. It sank 3.5%. Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, dropped 9.4% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. It's seen bets build up sharply that its stock price will drop, according to S3 Partners. Only Meta Platforms has seen a bigger increase this year in what's called short interest, in which traders essentially bet a stock's price will fall. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, sank 2.1%. Criticism has been rising that stock prices across Wall Street have shot too high, too fast since hitting a bottom in April and have become too expensive. Palantir's stock came into Tuesday with a tremendous gain of 130% for the year so far. The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI, the AP reports.

Palantir's stock came into Tuesday with a tremendous gain of 130% for the year so far. One way companies can make their stock prices look less expensive is to deliver growth in profits. Palo Alto Networks rose 3.1% after reporting earnings and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts' expectations. Home Depot's gain of 3.2% was the biggest reason the Dow did better than other indexes. The retailer reported quarterly results that were a bit short of what analysts expected, but it delivered growth in revenue. Viking Therapeutics tumbled 42.1% after the biopharmaceutical company released results from a clinical trial of an oral tablet that could treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. Tegna rose 4.3% after Nexstar Media Group said it will buy the owner of 64 television stations across the country for $22 per share in cash. Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S Class Action: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Novo Investors of the Pending Class Action Lawsuit with a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 – NVO

Full Content:
August 19, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=162072&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Air Canada said flights started Tuesday afternoon.

Title: Palantir Stock Slumps Over 9% As AI Stocks Like NVIDIA And Meta Cool Off

ByAntonio Pequeño IV, Forbes Staff. Software analytics firm Palantir is plummeting on the stock market Tuesday, with shares falling 9% as other AI darlings like NVIDIA and Meta cool down from gains made earlier this month. Palantir shares were down 9% on Tuesday afternoon at $157.91, erasing strong gains made by the company after it topped Wall Street estimates and hiked its full-year guidance in its latest earnings report this month. Tuesday’s slump marked the company’s fifth consecutive day of losses as it trades down 15.5% since Aug. 13. Multiple outlets have linked Palantir’s tumble to a short report from Citron Research that says the company’s stock is overvalued, citing OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation and noting if OpenAI’s price-to-sales was applied to Palantir, the company’s stock would trade at $40—a massive drop from its $159.15 per share. NVIDIA shares slipped as low as 3% hours before close, also erasing gains that began near the start of the month. Meta’s stock fell nearly 2% to $753.43 per share Tuesday afternoon, adding on to its 3% drop in share price on Monday. The Nasdaq fell 1.4% in midday trading.

Cryptocurrency stocks also tumbled Tuesday, with Coinbase shares falling nearly 5%, Robinhood falling more than 5% and Bitcoin sliding 2.4% amid a two-day crypto pullback. $1 billion. That is how much Palantir reported in quarterly revenue this month, marking the first time the firm has surpassed the milestone earnings number. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the state of the AI bubble to The Verge last week, telling the outlet, “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” adding, “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Zooming out, Palantir’s recent stock struggles are part of a wildly successful year for the company’s shares, which are up 110% since the start of the year, when they were priced at $75.19. Investors have been wowed by the company’s AI tools, which likely played a large role in Palantir securing a $10 billion deal with the Army that consolidates 75 contracts into one arrangement, according to Axios. Palantir expects more growth this year, boosting its guidance and anticipating revenues between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion for the full year, up from its previous expectations of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. Palantir’s success comes as the Trump administration has pushed for greater AI and chip infrastructure in the U.S., roping in financial commitments companies like Apple, NVIDIA, OpenAI and even considering a 10% stake in Intel, shares of which rocketed 7% Tuesday.

Title: Nvidia Considering 'Variety of Products' as New China AI Chip Details Emerge

Nvidia (NVDA) said it's considering a "variety of products" for its roadmap as more details emerge about a new AI chip for the Chinese market. This follows recent signs of inroads in winning approvals from the Trump administration to expand sales to the country. Nvidia could look to deliver samples of the new chip to Chinese clients for testing as early as next month, Reuters reported Tuesday. The new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, is based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and more advanced than the H20 chip the company recently won approval to resume selling in China after striking a deal with President Trump to pay the U.S. government 15% of its China chip revenue. A Nvidia spokesperson told Investopedia Tuesday that the company wants to be "prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow," adding "everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use." Shares of Nvidia fell close to 4% amid broader tech sector losses Tuesday. Still, they've added nearly a third of their value this year, after their recent rally amid optimism about the company's sales in China and strong demand for AI hardware. While many on Wall Street saw the recent 15% revenue-sharing agreements for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a positive development for the companies—which took a hit on export curbs earlier in the year—some have raised concerns about what they could mean for American tech companies navigating rapidly changing China trade policies. "It feels like a slippery slope to us," Bernstein analysts wrote last week of the deals, which could open the door to others and pointed to a lack of clarity on whether and how much companies could be pushed to pay to sell such products in China. "Sure it might raise some money, but doesn't seem to address any strategic issues beyond a grab for dollars," the analysts said. Last week, Trump suggested he could be open to expanding Nvidia's licenses to cover more powerful chips, after further negotiations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang could be asked for more details on the company's plans when the chipmaker reports its latest quarterly financial results after the bell Aug. 27. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent share price values.

Title: Volkswagen Is Turning Engine Performance into a Subscription Upgrade

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/19/2025 9:39:59 AM PDT by packagingguy Volkswagen is now offering owners of its ID.3 EV hatchback the option to boost their car’s performance — for a monthly subscription fee. Instead of following the traditional model of offering improved performance through upgraded components, VW has locked its car’s true potential behind a software subscription. Auto Express reports that German automaker Volkswagen has introduced a subscription-based model for unlocking the full potential of its ID.3 electric car, a new model available in the UK. While the ID.3 Pro and Pro S models are listed on the configurator as producing 201 horsepower, buyers must pay a monthly subscription fee of £16.50 ($22.29) to access the car’s maximum output of 228 horsepower. This subscription, which comes after a one-month free trial, is nearly three times the cost of a standard Netflix subscription with ads. Owners can also opt for a lifetime subscription priced at £649 ($877), which remains tied to the vehicle even if it is sold. Volkswagen states that the performance upgrade increases the net power by 27 horsepower and the maximum torque from 265Nm to 310Nm without affecting the car’s range. As the ID.3 is registered at 228 horsepower from the factory, owners are not required to inform their insurance company about the upgrade. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

It's not like they have a reliable product so you're better off buying a Japanese car anyhow. Somebody will hack it and charge $50 a car............... Heated seats have serious drawbacks for some. Why not just rent cars instead of selling them? Oh, right, we do that already. IBM pioneered it with mainframes. Pay the minimum and get an artificially constrained computer. Pay up and get its full capabilities. The plan is to rent self-driving cars by the hour. No options. It is the alure of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) driving this. A predictable stream of income is sometimes more attractive even than profit, at least from an accounting standpoint. I agree...a hacking will occur. But when you have issues, and bring the car to the garage...once hooked up, they will find the hack code, and then tell you the warranty is busted. Then what? This is driven to anticipate you will hack, and they will dump you for repairs early on. Exactly, well said. And like how many people need or even notice a difference in an extra 27 horsepower. Like GM offering 3 different V6 engines with a total horsepower range difference of 30 HP. People are gullible. “...for a monthly subscription fee” I exactly what Microsoft Office 365 is doing. Ditto with some other software companies are trying. Long term it will serve to piss off customers. I suspect car companies which do not hinder the cars performance will do better in the marketplace. I actually like it. You can try it out for a cheap monthly price, and if you like it pay the life-time fee of $877. It’d be analogous to trying the powerful 8-cyl gas car cheaply for a month before paying $877 extra for it vs the cheaper 6-cyl. You pays your dollar, you takes your chance............... and they wonder why some people cheer when executives from Blackrock or United Healthcare are shot. The Babylon Bee should do a story on this. Volkswagen: Pay a monthly fee or your trunk will no longer open. Pay a monthly fee or you won’t be able to make right turns. Come on, Bee.

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Aug. 19, 2025)
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/10-investment-must-reads-for-this-week-aug-19-2025-
Time Published: 2025-08-19T16:22:35Z
Full Content:
What to make of Vanguard’s moves to diversify from its core business of passive funds. How the hidden costs in leveraged ETFs eat into returns. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 19, 2025 Think of the Stock Market as Great Businesses—Not a ‘Hissing, Writhing Bag of Poisonous Snakes’ “And that’s the mother of all sort of hardwired human nature kinks that causes people to fail as investors. And what I’ve said to advisors is 85% to 90% of your job is that, is the management of that. You make a plan. You set goals once. Assuming the goals haven’t changed and don’t change, you make a plan once.” (Morningstar) Vanguard’s Push Into Active Is Anything But Passive “Aside from the active strategies, an obvious common denominator is the name Wellington. That would be investment firm Wellington Management, which was founded in 1928 and, in 1951, hired John C. Bogle, who would then go on to establish the Vanguard Group in 1975. Needless to say, Vanguard and Wellington have a history together, and the former is tapping into the deep well of asset management expertise in the latter to create these new ETFs.” (VettaFi) Leveraged ETFs: The Hidden Costs That Eat Your Returns “To most market watchers, the default explanation for long-term underperformance in leveraged ETFs is volatility decay, or the math that comes from these funds resetting leverage daily to match their target multiple (like 2x). In choppy markets, that reset can create a ‘buy high, sell low’ effect that steadily erodes returns compared with a simple multiple of the underlying’s long-term performance.” (ETF.com) BlackRock's Rick Rieder: This is the best investing environment ever “Rick Rieder, BlackRock global fixed income CIO, joins 'Closing Bell' to discuss Rieder's thoughts on the current investing environment, if the Fed will cut rates in September and risks to equity markets.” (CNBC) When ‘invest like the 1%’ fails: How Yieldstreet’s real estate bets left customers with massive losses “But Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they’ve learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration.”(CNBC) Alts Managers Face Skepticism from RIAs Over Private Credit ETFs “But vehicle familiarity among RIAs remains low, and asset managers looking to be early movers are having to invest in educational and marketing outreach.” (FundFire) How One Big Private-Equity Fund Makes Its Numbers Incomprehensible “Such funds should, at a minimum, allow investors to see how much each private-equity holding originally cost and compare that with its latest carrying value. Some funds are making this exercise difficult. This is particularly problematic in light of recent controversies over some of the industry’s valuation methods.” (WSJ) How Semiliquid Funds Became the Preferred Vehicle for Private Assets “Traditional and alternative asset managers have seized on interval funds in particular, which have familiar tickers, electronic trading, tax forms, and regulatory disclosures, as the preferred vehicle to offer private assets to regular advisors and investors.” (Morningstar) Amidst Tragedy, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust ‘Continues to Stand Strong’ “The firm recapped its year-to-date and overall performance – the first time since the passing Wesley LePatner in a mass shooting at the firm’s Manhattan headquarters. The board of directors has since appointed Rob Harper, a seasoned Blackstone executive, as interim CEO. The company also said it is drawing upon Frank Cohen’s extensive leadership experience as board chair and former CEO of BREIT during this period.” (AltsWire) AGM Alts Weekly | 8.17.25: Own the narrative “There were major moves that signal an important evolution in how investment firms and companies are looking to own the direct relationship with their community and customers. Companies recognize that in today’s world they need to go direct. They need to be their own media.” (Alt Goes Mainstream) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Aug 20, 2025 Aug 20, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Ford made its big EV announcement early this week — a plan to invest $2 billion to transform its Louisville Assembly Plant into a factory capable of making a new generation of affordable EVs, starting with a midsize pickup truck with a base price of $30,000 that is slated to launch in 2027. Amid the presentations from various executives, union leaders, and employees, CEO Jim Farley said something I couldn’t quite shake: “There are no guarantees with this project. We’re doing so many new things, I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right; it is a bet. There is risk.” The bet? The company put together a skunkworks team, which worked for a couple of years to find a way to build a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. To do that, the company has scrapped the century-old system that made Ford a household name and developed a new three-pronged assembly line that uses more automation and unicastings. Ford, like many other automakers, is being squeezed by tariffs, slower than expected EV demand, and the looming threat of competition from China. The company has to act if it wants to stay relevant. But is this the move? Ford can’t really use this manufacturing technique at other factories, since it is pinned to how the vehicle is designed and then split into three unicastings — a major departure from the method used to assemble its other vehicles. What this means is we’re witnessing a $5 billion experiment ($3 billion for the LFP battery factory and $2 billion for Louisville) to keep jobs in the United States. A few little birds told us that rental car startup Kyte, which once billed itself as the “best alternative to Hertz,” is no longer operating. The startup was already in trouble late last year after slashing staff and cutting down to just two markets. But in July, the company sold its customer list to peer-to-peer car share company Turo. (Turo declined further commenting on the terms.) And since then, Kyte appears to have gone fully under, entering a form of receivership in California in late July. That has apparently left a number of customers in the lurch who had already booked rentals through Kyte; Turo told TechCrunch it is only responsible for the assets it purchased — not any financial claims against the now-defunct Kyte.

Bumper, a U.K.-based buy now, pay later platform for car servicing and repairs, raised $10.8 million in a Series B extension funding led by Autotech Ventures. InMotion Ventures, Suzuki Global Ventures, Porsche Ventures, and Shell Ventures also joined. Chowdeck, a Lagos-based food delivery startup, raised $9 million in Series A funding led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. Eve Air Mobility — the urban air mobility company, announced a $230 million capital raise and dual listing in the U.S. and Brazil. The company has raised $1 billion to date. Ultraviolette, the Indian electric motorcycle startup, raised $21 million in an all-equity round led by the corporate venture arm of Japanese electronics giant TDK Corporation. Ultraviolette’s existing investors Zoho Corporation and Lingotto (previously Exor Capital) also participated. Via has filed its S-1 paperwork on its road to IPO. The transit software company has not yet determined the number of shares to be offered or the price range. This dropped just as I was sending out this newsletter, so I haven’t read through the entire doc yet. A couple of items worth noting, though: The company’s revenue grew 35% to $337 million from 2023 to 2024. Its net loss narrowed to $90 million over the same time period. And CEO Daniel Ramot’s 2024 compensation package, which includes stock grants, is $9.5 million. Per the footnotes, the company is issuing him an additional grant package for 2025 and a cash bonus program. WeRide, the Chinese autonomous vehicle company, has secured an investment from Grab. The companies did not disclose the investment amount. WeRide said the funds will help speed deployment and commercialization of Level 4 robotaxis and shuttles in Southeast Asia. Foxconn will no longer build electric tractors for California startup Monarch Tractor after the Taiwanese tech giant recently sold its Ohio factory to SoftBank. History lesson: Foxconn had planned to establish an electric vehicle contract manufacturing operation at the factory and Monarch was one of four companies it was working with. The other three (Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and IndiEV) have all gone bankrupt. Some high-profile executive shuffling is underway. Self-driving truck maker Waabi hired Uber Freight CEO Lior Ron (who has a long and interesting history in the AV world) as chief operating officer. Rebecca Tinucci, who previously spent six years building Tesla’s charging network, has taken over as head of Uber Freight. Ron will stay on as Uber Freight’s chairman. A spending freeze on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program has thawed after months of uncertainty. The Trump administration has finally issued new guidance that states can use to dole out $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, after spending months withholding the money. Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India, is beta-testing its food delivery service in Bengaluru in a challenge to market leaders Swiggy and Zomato. How many pivots can one company make in its lifetime? Revel is testing the bounds of that question. The company, which started out as an electric scooter rental service, has shut down its ride-hailing service in New York City. Revel will instead focus on its nascent EV charging business. A bit more on the “Tesla Dojo is dead” news that I wrote about last week. Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has disbanded the team working on its Dojo AI training supercomputer, just weeks after announcing he expected to have Tesla’s second cluster operating “at scale” in 2026. Tesla is shifting its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. Note: Tesla’s plant in Buffalo, New York, was supposed to be the home of the Dojo supercomputer and the company had committed to investing $500 million into the factory over five years to bring Dojo there. Riding in a Waymo robotaxi is a modern, even futuristic, experience for customers. With one exception: the music. Reporter Max Zeff wrote about why Waymo’s music upgrade matters. The Autonocast, the other podcast I co-host (I’m also on TechCrunch Equity) that is focused on the future of transportation, had another episode that I think you’ll be keen to listen to. This time, we interview Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Topics Transportation Editor Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

August 19, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

U.S. equities were mixed at midday as the market weighed more corporate earnings reports and news from the chip sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Japan's SoftBank Group made a $2 billion investment in the struggling chipmaker. Shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) advanced after the cybersecurity firm reported profit, sales, and guidance that beat forecasts on rising demand from companies looking for increasingly powerful tools to protect against hackers. Home Depot (HD) shares gained when the biggest home-improvement retailer affirmed its guidance on growth in do-it-yourself and construction projects. Nvidia (NVDA) shares declined on word CEO Jensen Huang sold 150,000 shares of the artificial intelligence semiconductor giant. Shares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) plunged after the biopharma firm's Phase 2 trial of its experimental weight-loss pill showed a large number of patients experienced adverse side effects. Oracle (ORCL) shares fell following reports of layoffs and the exit of the cloud software company’s chief security officer. Oil and gold futures dipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid.

Title: Former Steward Advisors Launch $850M RIA Clear Trail with Dynasty

Father-son duo Randy and Matt Price and colleague Matthew Kerns launch Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors after an 18-month review. August 19, 2025 A father-son duo has left registered investment advisor Steward Partners to launch their own shop on the Dynasty Financial Partners platform. Chairman Randy Price and son and CEO Matt Price have started Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors, which has $850 million in assets and a self-proclaimed focus on “the millionaire next door” or those in need of portfolios that can generate retirement income and leverage tax strategies. The Prices are leaving their Steward practice, which was called The Price Group, along with Clear Trail co-founder Matthew Kerns and four other staff members, two of whom were recently hired, according to Randy Price. “This has been an 18-month process,” Randy Price said. “We wanted to own our future, we wanted to own the client experience, and we wanted to own the ability to take care of the client because at the end of the day, that is what makes the world go round.” Randy Price was an executive managing director at Steward, an employee-owned hybrid partnership of independent advisory firms, for over seven years. Before that, he had an over 18-year run as a financial advisor at RBC Wealth Management. But he goes back to earlier in his career, when he was doing financial planning for executives at companies such as ConocoPhillips, General Motors, and Shell, as shaping the planning-first mentality of Clear Trail. Related:Deals & Moves: RIA Concurrent Stakes Asset Manager; Homrich Berg Now HB Wealth “Everybody today in our team that is client-facing has to have their CFP,” Randy Price said. “We don’t do investments before we do comprehensive planning.” Randy Price said he had considered moving to Dynasty years ago, but it wasn’t yet the right fit. Now, he said the team is ready to work within their model and focus areas, which include every client having a “family index number” that guides their financial plan. They will leverage Dynasty for back-office support such as planning tools, compliance, accounting and investment platforms. Randy Price also liked the peer group he would join at Dynasty, which has over 55 network firms and more than 500 Dynasty network advisors. “When you look at the people who have joined them, it’s a who’s who of Phi Beta Kappa in the industry,” he said. “To be in that group is a distinct honor.” In 2022, Dynasty sold minority stakes to Charles Schwab and private equity firm Abry Partners. In 2024, it announced a minority capital raise from BlackRock, JP Morgan Asset Management and Schwab. Clear Trail is looking to hire a director of financial planning and an in-house tax specialist. Randy Price said it also plans to hire more advisors interested in its model. Related:Mariner to Acquire $5B Institutional Consulting Firm “There are a lot of like-minded advisors out there that own their own practice and don’t want to go sell their business and give their clients away, if you will, to somebody they don’t really know, and they want a nice landing point for their career as well,” he said. “We’re building our new office with that in mind.” Randy Price said he sees himself working for at least seven to 10 more years, but expects his son and Kerns to continue what he expects to be a larger RIA by the time he retires. “As I look back, I feel like I’ve been somewhat of a franchisee over a number of years,” Randy Price said. “More and more people are leaving the wirehouses. ... the votes are that this is a much better space, a much better arena, a much better opportunity to do what we were called to do without the overhang of corporate influences.” Alex Ortolani Senior Reporter, WealthManagement.com Alex Ortolani is a New York-based senior reporter with WealthManagement.com with a focus on deals, moves and trends in the registered investment advisor space.

Title: Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks ahead of a storm, and could buy them back after it hits, top strategist says

Time Published: 2025-08-19T14:57:38Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks because he sees a storm on the horizon — and could buy them back once prices tumble, a senior market strategist says. The "Oracle of Omaha" has a "history of selling out of the stock market" when economic and financial indicators are "signaling a bear market or a recession is coming," Wedbush's chief investment strategist, Paul Dietrich, told Business Insider. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for 11 straight quarters, even though the market has "soared" to new highs in that period, Dietrich added. The investor's conglomerate offloaded $212 billion of shares while only buying $34.5 billion, meaning its net disposals exceeded $177 billion — more than the market value of BlackRock or Boeing. Buffett also halted stock buybacks for the last four quarters as he no longer saw Berkshire stock as cheap, Dietrich said. The pause marks a big change from Berkshire's peak repurchases of over $20 billion in both 2020 and 2021. Berkshire's share sales and lack of buybacks have contributed to its cash pile, which more than tripled to a record $344 billion over the three years to June 30. Buffett has jettisoned stocks and gone to cash ahead of past downturns, Dietrich said. Berkshire grew its cash pile from around $11 billion in 1997 to $35 billion in 1998, and ramped up its net stock sales from $700 million in 1999 to $2.7 billion in 2000, ahead of the dot-com crash. The corporate titan had grown its cash pile to more than $70 billion when the financial crisis struck. It fell to about $52 billion by the end of 2008 as Buffett made a series of lucrative deals during the disaster. Berkshire ramped up its net stock purchases from around $5 billion in 2006 to $11 billion in 2007 as it capitalized on depressed asset prices. Buffett sounded cautious about the market during Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Dietrich said. Before his shock announcement that he intended to step down as CEO at the end of this year, Buffett bemoaned the lack of potential bargains as asset valuations continued to rise. Dietrich said the "Buffett Indicator" may be alarming the Berkshire CEO. The gauge, which compares the US stock market's value to the US economy's size, has surged to historic highs of above 210%, he said. That means the combined market capitalization of all actively traded US stocks is more than double the latest quarterly estimate of US GDP. Buffett once wrote that buying stocks at readings approaching 200% would be "playing with fire." The Wall Street veteran recalled Buffett's famous advice to "be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful," saying the Berkshire chief is preparing to pounce once valuations fall to attractive levels. Dietrich said Buffett would use his cash pile "to eventually buy back Apple and the other shares he has sold — but at a major discount —after the current nose-bleed stock market highs eventually come back down to earth." Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Highlights Neurosymbolic AI blends neural networks with logic-based reasoning to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in generative AI. Amazon and Imandra are advancing the approach in parallel, Amazon with warehouse robots and shopping assistants, Imandra with finance, code verification and regulatory compliance. Imandra’s tools, such as Code Logician, promise to slash error-prone processes with “mathematical guarantees,” according to the startup. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can astound with human-like conversation and research superpowers, but it can also be disastrously wrong. That unreliability is a major barrier to adoption as AI begins to control physical machines, payments and other high-stakes domains.

Δ Neurosymbolic AI is a rising technique that aims to solve the hallucination problem. It’s a hybrid approach that marries gen AI’s neural networks for pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning’s logic that can prove whether outputs are correct, with mathematical precision. The goal is to maintain the flexibility of generative AI while making its outputs trustworthy. Trust is a key factor for greater adoption of generative and agentic AI, according to a July 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report. While chief financial officers (CFOs) have warmed up to generative AI, they are still unsure whether they could trust agentic AI. Just 15% of executives are considering deployment. Neurosymbolic AI could help. Its roots stem from the early 20th century, when mathematicians developed ways to formalize reasoning using symbolic logic, laying the foundation of modern computing. Out of that tradition grew automated reasoning, a subset of symbolic reasoning that uses logic to prove the correctness of computer programs. Amazon has become one of neurosymbolic AI’s most prominent adopters, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its Automated Reasoning Group, founded more than a decade ago, built tools to verify security policies in the AWS cloud. Those methods now underpin new systems such as the Vulcan warehouse robots, which combine neural networks for perception with automated reasoning for precise planning. Amazon also applies neurosymbolic AI to customer-facing products. The Rufus shopping assistant, for example, uses large language models for conversation but leans on automated reasoning to ensure recommendations align with rules and policies. In August, Amazon announced an automated reasoning feature to minimize hallucinations, claiming it can identify correct model responses with up to 99% accuracy. “This is emblematic of where the field is going,” Imandra Co-founder and co-CEO Grant Passmore said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Fundamentally, just large language models on their own cannot be trusted to reliably reason. On the other hand, you have this incredible and hitherto underutilized field of AI — which is automated reasoning — completely built on logic, completely precise” and independently audited. See also: The Two Faces of AI: Gen AI’s Triumph Meets Agentic AI’s Caution Amazon’s automated reasoning group was founded by Byron Cook, its former distinguished scientist. About 20 years ago, he and Passmore crossed paths at Cambridge University in the U.K. In 2014, Passmore and Co-founder and Co-CEO Denis Ignatovich — a college friend who ran Deutsche Bank’s equities trading desk in London — founded Imandra to apply neurosymbolic logic to finance. Ignatovich’s constant concern was that a developer working on the trading system could inadvertently omit a line of code that causes the system to violate a regulation — and it becoming a big issue. At the time, Passmore was working on new techniques for reasoning in the U.K. “We realized we could actually commercialize this stuff,” Passmore said. “Finance needs it. Financial regulators need it, and finance can pay for it.” Founded in 2014 and incorporated in the U.S. in 2019, Imandra has raised $23 million from investors including Citi, Green Visor Capital, Albion, IQ Capital and Austin’s LiveOak Venture Partners. Goldman Sachs is a client, and Citi led its most recent round. One use case is automating the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol, which lets organizations send electronic trading instructions to each other, say from Goldman Sachs to BlackRock or the New York Stock Exchange. “Every computer in capital markets trading uses a version of this protocol, but everybody is allowed to customize it,” Passmore said. Typically, these quirks are described in 100-page PDFs. To connect, companies had to interpret the manual, build their own client code and then test repeatedly to make sure both sides can connect without errors. Imandra built a mathematically precise language for specifying the FIX protocol. Instead of relying on hundreds of pages of PDFs, clients can now use automated reasoning to ensure precise communication each way. “This very error-prone process at the plumbing level of the markets used to take sometimes upwards of six months” for a new participant to be onboarded, Passmore said. “Now they can be onboarded within three days with mathematical guarantees.” To scale its approach, Imandra launched Imandra Universe, a platform it describes as the first marketplace for neurosymbolic agents. Similar to Hugging Face’s repository for machine learning models, it hosts symbolic reasoning engines specialized in domains from geometry to logistics. A “Reasoner Gateway” lets developers plug them into agent frameworks, augmenting AI systems with logical checks. One flagship tool, Code Logician, targets the flood of AI-generated code. Once installed in coding assistants like Cursor, Code Logician builds a mathematical description of what the AI generated code is doing and use Imandra to verify it. Passmore said around 60% of AI-generated code contains bugs and Code Logician can make 96% of the code correct within three iterations. Imandra is expanding Code Logician beyond Python to Java and even COBOL, reflecting enterprise demand for code migration. It is also developing agents for geometry reasoning, among other pursuits.

Reviews ethics statement Make your Echo pull more weight with Alexa commands that help you live smarter. Your day gets easier when you know which Alexa commands to use. Since launching in 2014, Alexa has grown far beyond its original role as a simple voice assistant for music and reminders. With the rollout of Alexa Plus and new AI-powered tools, it's now a capable hub for managing nearly every part of your daily routine. From controlling smart devices and automating chores to keeping your calendar organized and managing your Fire TV, Alexa can bring real convenience to a connected home. If you haven't tried using newer commands in a while, now's the perfect time to see just how much more useful it's become. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Exclusive: Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital to tokenize $300 million on Avalanche
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/19/anthony-scaramucci-skybridge-capital-tokenization-avalanche/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another investment firm is putting funds on the blockchain. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, announced Tuesday that his company plans to hold around $300 million from two funds in the form of tokenized assets. SkyBridge’s move comes amid a wave of enthusiasm for what the crypto industry calls tokenization. The process entails creating digital token versions of real-world assets like Treasury bills, which can be easily traded on a blockchain in the same way as Bitcoin or stablecoins. “I’m basically seeing 2026 into 2027 as the age of real-world tokenization,” Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had a brief stint at the White House during President Donald Trump’s first term, told Fortune. SkyBridge Capital plans to deploy its tokenized funds on Avalanche, a blockchain that boasts almost $2 billion in assets on its network, according to crypto analytics provider DefiLlama. The amount of money that SkyBridge will deploy is about 10% of his firm’s assets under management, Scaramucci told Fortune. One of the two funds he’s tokenizing specializes in investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have not been deemed securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to SkyBridge’s most recent investor disclosure. The other is a fund of funds composed of SkyBridge’s other investment vehicles, including both its venture and crypto funds. Advocates say issuing products like investment funds on decentralized networks can reduce transaction fees and cut out middlemen. Traditionally, there are a series of individuals between the buyers and sellers of financial assets, each of whom has to vet and evaluate the origin of, say, a stake in a fund—even if that fund is made up of cryptocurrencies already on blockchains. Each of these middlemen can charge fees and slow the process down. Blockchains are decentralized databases, meaning that no one party can tamper with the information stored on the network. Hence, there theoretically does not need to be a middleman to verify the owner and authenticity of a financial asset issued on it. Users can look up the details themselves. While proponents have lauded the virtues of tokenization for some time, the business of putting real-world assets on blockchains is still nascent, though it appears to be gaining momentum. Financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck have recently issued their own money-market funds onto a series of blockchains like Solana and Aptos. Eventually, advocates envision a world where investors can buy and transfer their stakes in various funds without having to wade through spreadsheets or repeated calls to banks to wire money. SkyBridge Capital plans to partner with Tokeny, a company that specializes in tokenization, to put its funds on Avalanche. “Ultimately, we want to achieve two things,” said John Wu, the president of Ava Labs, one of the main developers behind the Avalanche network. “One is to bring activity on chain from the traditional finance world and also show the world that this technology can benefit them in terms of cost savings.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Let Manufacturing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The deal coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in the semiconductor company. Japan-based Softbank Group will make a $2 billion investment in computer chip maker Intel Corp. as they look to deepen their involvement in advanced technology and U.S. semiconductor innovation, the companies said Monday. The agreement coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in Intel amid the company’s financial struggles. The Silicon Valley company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion in its latest quarter. It is also downsizing and cutting back certain initiatives in an effort to position itself for growth in the artificial intelligence era. As part of the investment, Softbank has agreed to pay $23 per share of Intel’s common stock, slightly discounted from its current share value on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions. Softbank is also collaborating with Foxconn to operate an AI server site in Ohio. “This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement. The deal would give Softbank a roughly 2% stake in Intel, making the investment holding firm Intel’s fifth largest stakeholder with 87 million shares. Blackrock and Vanguard are the largest, each holding a roughly 9% stake in the company, according to Yahoo! Finance. “Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement. In addition to Softbank, the Trump administration is interested in a potential 10% government stake in Intel following positive talks between the president and Tan, Bloomberg first reported. White House staff did not immediately return requests for comment. After calling for Tan’s resignation earlier this month over alleged ties to Chinese firms, Trump swiftly changed his tune, later posting on Truth Social that the executive’s “success and rise is an amazing story.” Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is making deep cuts as part of an overall revamp. It plans to reduce its core workforce to 75,000 by the end of this year, down from 99,500 as of Dec. 28, 2024. The company is also slowing construction of its $28 billion chip facility in New Albany, Ohio, and scrapping manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland, among other actions. Last week, Intel extended the closing date for the sale of its majority stake in Altera to Sept. 13. The deal is valued at $4.46 billion and would give private equity firm Silver Lake a 51% ownership in the programmable chip company. Approximately 82 workers are being laid off at Altera’s office in San Jose, California, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filing. Their last day is Oct. 8.

Title: Former Meta senior manager says low-performer quotas can lead to 'egg-on-the-face moments' in reviews
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-quotas-reviews-challenges-for-managers-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-19T13:17:50Z
Full Content:
Low-performer quotas can lead to some "mea culpa" moments for managers — especially if a manager has been telling their team they're all aces, says startup founder Stefan Mai. Mai, who cofounded Hello Interview, previously worked as a senior engineering manager at Meta and a software development manager at Amazon. Both workplaces have instructed managers to be stricter in how they review employees, which has sometimes led to cuts for "low performers" or placements on performance improvement plans. Low-performer quotas typically require managers to label a certain percentage of their teams as underperformers. The quotas can be a way for a company to push managers to expect excellence across their teams, hold stragglers accountable, and deliver the kind of critical feedback that some managers may have avoided messaging. Those quotas can also lead to a whole lot of heartache when a manager feels their team is performing at its best, Mai said on "The Peterman Pod." Mai described a hypothetical "worst scenario" for a manager: They've spent the lead-up to the review cycle praising their team's hard work, only to get an instruction from their director that "somebody's got to be in that low bucket." "Now you've to go change your tack," Mai said. "Those sort of like egg-on-the-face moments are what most managers are afraid of, and they try their damnedest to try to prevent those situations." A company tightening its performance-review process can also be a precursor to job cuts. Three years after Mai left Meta in 2022, the company laid off 3,600 employees, or about 5% of its workforce. Many of these employees were labeled "low performers" — a title that trailed some of them after their exit. Months after the layoffs, an internal memo at Meta pushed managers to put more employees in the "below expectations" tier. For teams of 150 or more, Meta wanted managers to put 15% to 20% of employees in the bottom bucket. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and to "move out low-performers" more quickly. Microsoft recently employed a new strategy to handle those it viewed as poor performers, per an internal email to managers: pay them to leave. Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson wrote that the tech giant, "like most companies," has a performance management process that "helps our managers identify who in their teams are performing well and who needs more support." "The vast majority of our colleagues regularly meet or exceed expectations, but for the small number of employees who don't, we provide coaching and opportunities to help them improve," Stephenson wrote. "If they're unable to do that, then we may have to discuss them leaving the company." To Mai, a good manager should be able to "message it appropriately" when employees are labeled low-performers. "That way they're not surprised, you're not surprised," Mai said. "The structure works fairly." Managers don't always have that level of foresight — and others are simply new to the job or "immature," as Mai put it. That's where the real pain occurs. "People have to go 'mea culpa' with their reports," Mai said. "For everyone involved, most of which the actual person who's receiving that news, it can be devastating. It's pretty bad."

Title: Median CEO pay at top US companies surges to $19m per year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/19/median-ceo-pay-at-top-us-companies-surges-to-19m-per-year/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T12:45:11Z
Full Content:
Pay for S&P 500 chief executives rose by 7.7 per cent last year as packages at the US’s biggest companies keep increasing. Median total pay for S&P bosses rose to $19 million (€16.3 million) last year. The jump in median chief executive pay was higher than a 7.2 per cent rise in 2023, according to Farient Advisors, a pay consultancy, and marked the quickest pace of growth since an 11.5 per cent gain in 2021. Total pay for the broader American workforce increased 3.6 per cent in the 12 months that ended December 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “We’re still seeing executive pay increases above the inflationary rate as well as above typical rank-and-file employees,” said Eric Hoffmann, chief data officer at Farient Advisors. The highest paid S&P 500 CEO last year was Rick Smith of Taser maker Axon Enterprise, who raked in $164.5 million mostly from stock awards after meeting targets over several years, according to data provided by MyLogIQ. Brian Niccol, chief executive of Starbucks, was second with $95.8 million in total last year, mostly from stock awards. His pay package included a $5 million sign-on bonus and two one-off stock awards that ranged from $75 million to $80 million to cover forfeited cash and unvested equity he accrued while running Chipotle. Axon did not respond to a request for comment and Starbucks declined to comment. In the UK, median pay for chief executives of the 100 most valuable London-listed companies rose 6.8 per cent to £4.58 million in 2024-25 year on year, according to the High Pay Centre’s annual survey released on Sunday. This is the highest level on record, and the fourth successive year that bosses’ pay has increased. The level of pay for S&P 500 executives has drawn scrutiny from groups that question whether it is exacerbating inequality. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a national trade union, flagged Niccol’s pay package as an example of the widest pay gap between the top executive and median employee of one of the biggest US companies. Niccol’s annual pay was more than 6,666 times greater than the total pay for the median employee, a part-time barista, who earns about $15,000 a year, according to company filings. “We just see ever-growing income inequality in this country, and it’s becoming harder and harder for workers to make ends meet,” said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO. Sarah Anderson, global economy project director for the non-profit research group Institute for Policy Studies, said the widening gap between chief executive and worker pay was bad for democracy. “This gap between CEO and worker pay is a key driver of rising inequality and concentration of wealth at the top. We’re seeing more and more signs of how ultra-wealthy people have too much influence over our political system,” she said. Still, the larger pay ratio between an employee and a chief executive may also reflect a company’s business model. A retail boss is likely to have a wider pay ratio than a technology chief executive who usually hires engineers who are full-time workers. Nvidia, the most valuable US company, reported a chief executive to median employee pay ratio of 166 to 1, with its median employee earning $301,233 compared with CEO Jensen Huang’s total pay of $49.9 million in 2024. Meanwhile, shareholder support for executive pay packages has remained strong. ISS-Corporate found that the median shareholder support for executive pay packages has remained between 92.4 per cent and 92.6 per cent for the past five years. Jun Frank, head of compensation and governance services at ISS-Corporate, said US economic uncertainty may affect executive pay trends in the future.

Title: Will Opendoor Stock’s Rally Continue?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/19/will-opendoor-stocks-rally-continue/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T12:41:32Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Opendoor Technologies stock (NASDAQ:OPEN), which operates a digital platform for buying and selling residential real estate along with title insurance and escrow services in the United States, has fared exceedingly well over the past week. The stock rose 19% in Monday’s trading and remains up almost 60% over the past five trading sessions. So what’s fueling the rally? Opendoor has drawn renewed attention as a meme stock - a term used for stocks that surge largely due to hype on online forums and retail trading momentum, rather than on fundamentals. Moreover, the short interest stands at roughly 23% of outstanding shares, which results in sharp price spikes when trading activity intensifies. That said, shares are still down almost 90% from their SPAC-era peaks, although they have more than doubled year-to-date, underscoring how much of the surge is driven by sentiment and momentum. The rally has also been supported by a few company-specific developments. Opendoor recently announced its CEO would step down, a move investors greeted with enthusiasm, even through the rationale remains unclear. The company’s second-quarter results also modestly topped expectations, with both revenue of $63 million and EBITDA of $6 million coming in ahead of projections. related: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth Momentum, Yes. Fundamentals, Not So Much Opendoor stock may have momentum, but the fundamentals tell a slightly tougher story. At first glance, its Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.5x looks cheap compared to the S&P 500’s 3.2x. But this multiple may be a bit misleading, considering that Opendoor books the entire home sale price as revenue rather than the spread it actually earns. It’s also notable that its margins are razor-thin (or negative) and the business is highly sensitive to cyclical market conditions. The company’s top line has declined at an average of 24% annually over the past three years, although revenue did rebound 14% in the last 12 months to $5.2 billion and rose 3.7% year-over-year in the latest quarter. Losses also persist, with operating income standing at negative $204 million (a -3.9% margin) for the last 12 months. Opendoor carries $2.2 billion in debt, largely tied to financing its housing inventory. While this is common in the instant buying model, it is risky given the thin margins and exposure to housing market swings. The company's current market cap is $2.8 billion and this implies Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 79.2%. That said, the cash of $789 million does provide some cushion for the stock. While OPEN stock appears risky, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

August 19, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to provide additional drill results from its ongoing multi-year exploration campaign at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The latest results are from the North and P8P9 zones, targeting the down plunge continuity of higher-grade sub-zones beneath the current life of mine pits. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “These latest drill results confirm the down plunge continuity of multiple higher-grade sub-zones, with mineralized traces extending beneath the current resource pits, and remaining open at depth. The targeted drilling at the North and P8P9 zones further underscores the near-term potential at Bomboré to selectively pull higher-grade reserve pits to depth across the greater 14km long reserve defined trend. Of particular significance is the very broad sub-zone of mineralization at depth in P8P9. This zone does not appear at surface and is the broadest zone of continuous mineralization that has been intercepted at Bomboré, demonstrating significant exploration potential. The results of this concentrated drilling serve to complement the ongoing wider spaced step-out drill program, which is focused on identifying new higher-grade centers of mineralization both at depth and near-surface along strike. In H1-2025, approximately 30,000m of exploration drilling was completed at Bomboré. We are extremely pleased with the results and success of the program to date, which includes 1) extending North Zone footwall mineralization up to 200m below the current reserve pits along an 800m strike length (including 2.55g/t Au over 23.00m and 1.14g/t Au over 29.50m), 2) extending mineralization of the P17S high-grade sub-zone a further 300m down plunge (7.40g/t Au over 6.70m) and 3) identifying multiple broad near surface strike extensions (including 2.22g/t Au over 14.00m, 1.12g/t Au over 10.00m and 0.92g/t Au over 14.35m).3 Drilling will continue in H2-2025 on multiple fronts in support of the Company’s long-term goal of increasing Bomboré’s current stated global resource from 5 million ounces4 to a targeted 7 to 10 million ounces longer term.5 This is truly an exciting prospect with the ongoing hard rock expansions positioned to increase Bomboré’s overall production to 220,000-250,000 ounces per annum.6” North & North Hill Zone The ongoing drilling program continues to define and expand mineralized trends along the 3km strike length of the North Zone. Mineralization in the shear-hosted “Footwall Zone” is associated with rheological and chemical differences between siltstones and shales and the volcaniclastic footwall sediments. Gold grades are correlated with quartz veinlets with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite as accessory minerals. Ore shoots are developed where north-northeast trending steep-dipping shears intersect the northeast trending and easterly dipping footwall shear. Fold hinge and stretching lineation measurements confirm the moderate north to north-northeast plunging mineralization. The North Hill Zone, which sits east of the Footwall Zone, continues to deliver promising grades and widths with higher grades corresponding to increased extensional quartz veining. These veins occur between two steep-dipping north-northeast trending mineralized deformation zones suggesting on-going deformation has resulted in sites of dilation orthogonal to the steeper shears. The recent drilling was successful in confirming 1) the down plunge continuity of the higher-grade North Hill sub-zone beneath the life of mine reserve pit (including intercepts of 1.59g/t Au over 48.00m and 1.97g/t Au over 16.10m), and 2) further delineating higher-grade mineralization within the west dipping footwall shear (2.01g/t Au over 14.00m). Both of these higher-grade trends remain open to depth, and will be the focus of future follow-up drilling. North Hill Zone: selected high-grade sub-zone intercepts (previously reported7): P8P9 Zone The north-northeast trending P8P9 Zone is separated from the North Zone by an ephemeral drainage channel. Mineralization is defined over a 1.6km strike length with a width of 1.4km at its widest point. Discrete north-northeast higher-grade lenses occur within wide low-grade pyrite rich zones dipping steeply to the east. Similar to North Hill, zones of flatter lying extensional quartz veining are also present. Mineralization intersected in holes BBD1368, BBD1369 and BBD1370 demonstrate the potential for wide zones of mineralization with no significant expression near surface. Mineralization is hosted within a granodiorite unit with abundant disseminated pyrite with above background gold levels throughout. Of note is hole BBD1370 which returned 1.09g/t Au over 45.00m, within one of the widest mineralized intercepts on the property to date of 0.64g/t Au over 157.00m8. Overall, this step-out drilling at P8P9 was successful in extending this zone of higher-grade mineralization by a further 100m down plunge.

Mr. Gallaugher has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is undertaking to qualify as a ‘Competent Person’ as defined in the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves’ (JORC Code). Mr. Gallaugher is an employee of the Company and consents to the inclusion in this announcement of all technical statements based on his information in the form and context in which it appears. QA/QC The mineralized intervals are based on a lower cut-off grade of 0.28g/t in the Oxide+Upper Transition zone, and 0.45g/t Au in the Lower Transition+Hard Rock zone. The half-core drilling samples were cut using a diamond saw by Orezone employees. The samples were prepared by BIGS Global Burkina s.a.r.l. (“BIGS Global”) and then split by Orezone to 1 kg using Rotary Sample Dividers (“RSDs”). A 1kg aliquot was analyzed for leachable gold at BIGS Global in Ouagadougou, by bottle-roll cyanidation using a LeachWellTM catalyst. The leach residues from all samples with a leach grade greater than or equal to 0.25g/t Au were prepared by BIGS Global and then split by Orezone to 50g using RSDs. A 50g aliquot was analyzed by fire assay at BIGS Global. Orezone employs a rigorous Quality Control Program including a minimum of 10% standards, blanks and duplicates. The composite width and grade include the final leach residue assay results for most of the drill intercepts reported.

Title: Figure’s IPO filing marks Mike Cagney’s return to public markets

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Figure Technology, a 7-year-old blockchain-based lending company, on Monday filed for an IPO of its Class A common stock on Nasdaq, saying in its IPO paperwork that its revenue rose 22.4% to $191 million in the six months ended June 30, and that it reported a profit of $29 million in the same period, compared with a loss of $13 million a year earlier. The filing offers a chance at vindication for Figure co-founder Mike Cagney, who previously built SoFi before leaving the personal finance platform in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. SoFi went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger and has done pretty well as a public company — its stock is up over 200% in the past year, and its revenue rose 44% in the second quarter of 2025. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has established itself as one of the bigger players in blockchain-based lending, claiming more than 160 partners for its loan origination system and capital marketplace. Figure claims to be the largest non-bank provider of home equity lines of credit. The company, which Cagney founded with his wife June Ou, uses blockchain technology through its Provenance blockchain to speed along approvals for home equity loans, mortgage refinancing, and student and personal loans. In May, Figure said it was also expanding into cryptocurrency lending, signing a financing agreement with Victory Park Capital for what Figure described as the industry’s first securitized pool of crypto-backed loans. That product allows asset owners to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%. Terms of that deal with Victory Park were not disclosed. Cagney has a history of ambitious regulatory moves. As TechCrunch reported in late 2020, during the last days of the first Trump administration, Figure applied for a U.S. national bank charter that would have let it accept uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000 from accredited investors while avoiding traditional FDIC and Federal Reserve oversight. The approach could have established a template for other fintech and retail companies to obtain non-traditional bank charters and offer lucrative financial products while avoiding such oversight, but Figure withdrew its application last year amid broader fintech industry challenges. The company has undergone major leadership and organizational changes in the meantime. In April 2024, Figure appointed Michael Tannenbaum, former COO of Brex, as CEO. Tannenbaum previously worked with Cagney as SoFi’s chief revenue officer. And in an unusual corporate maneuver, Cagney spun off Figure Markets in early 2024, creating a standalone digital asset exchange for crypto trading, crypto-backed loans, and stablecoins. But just over a year later, in July, Figure reversed course and smooshed the two entities back together. The company says the strategy positions it to capture a huge and growing opportunity in real-world asset tokenization. (Real-world asset tokenization involves converting traditional assets like mortgages, real estate, or loans — even art — into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. Heavyweight financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are among those who have recently entered the space.) It’s worth noting that this is not Figure’s first attempt at going public. The company previously planned to list via a merger with a SPAC called Figure Acquisition Corp., but the deal got scrapped due to rising interest rates and redemption rates, among other challenges. The blank check company was later delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Figure, whose backers include Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital, also failed to complete a planned merger with mortgage lender Homebridge Financial Services in 2022, citing regulatory delays 10 months after the tie-up was announced. The IPO filing is no surprise to industry observers. For one, Figure — which last raised $200 million in 2021 at a $3.2 billion valuation — announced weeks ago that it had filed a confidential statement for an IPO. Further, the timing aligns with a growing wave of crypto-related companies seeking public listings, encouraged by the wildly successful debut of Circle Internet Group back in June, and the Trump administration’s full-bodied support for the cryptocurrency sector and related legislation. Circle’s shares soared more than 500% in their first two weeks on the public market. Crypto exchange Bullish has added to the momentum as its shares more than doubled on its first day of trading last week. On Friday, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange Gemini filed for an IPO despite reporting a $282.5 million net loss in the first half of 2025. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are serving as the lead bookrunners for Figure’s IPO. The number of shares to be offered and their price range have not yet been determined.

Title: Amazon Strategic Intelligence Report 2025: Strategic Outlook, Threat & Opportunity Analysis - Amazon at Dual Inflection Point as Trade Tensions and AI Breakthroughs Poise to Reshape Market Leadership

August 19, 2025 07:09 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Amazon Strategic Intelligence: Navigating Tariff Disruption & the Agentic AI Revolution: 2025 Strategic Outlook, Threat & Opportunity Analysis" company profile has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Amazon faces a dual inflection point where escalating trade tensions and breakthrough AI capabilities will fundamentally reshape its competitive landscape, operational efficiency, and market dominance within 18-24 months. This comprehensive intelligence report provides institutional investors, competitors (retailers, logistics, cloud players, hyperscalers, etc), suppliers, and policymakers with critical insights into Amazon's strategic vulnerabilities and emerging advantages as it navigates unprecedented tariff exposure and deploys next-generation agentic AI capabilities across its ecosystem. Tariffs are impacting Amazon’s 1P retail, 3P marketplace, GNFR, and devices businesses (e.g., Kindles and Echos), though 3P sellers—especially the roughly 500,000 Chinese sellers on the U.S. marketplace—will be hit hardest. Many non-Chinese sellers sourcing from China will also face higher landed costs, with price increases projected to average 10–25% across major import-dependent categories and even higher for niche or high-tariff items. The removal of the $800 de minimis exemption for Chinese shipments will disproportionately affect low-value goods, curbing much of this trade. Since Amazon shoppers are price-sensitive, each 10% price hike could lead to a 3–7% drop in unit sales, with potential 10–20% declines in categories like electronics, toys, home goods, and apparel. The squeeze will likely force out smaller or thin-margin sellers, reducing category listings, competition, and possibly causing inflation or stock shortages—threatening to reverse Amazon’s “flywheel” of more choice and lower prices. Financially, tariffs would slow GMV growth, cut into Amazon’s take rate, reduce advertising spend (notably from Chinese sellers), and even affect AWS usage by impacted sellers. 1P vendors—major brands supplying Amazon directly—face added strain as Amazon pressures them to absorb costs without raising prices. Broader impacts include dampening economic growth and raising recession risks, which could further temper consumer spending on Amazon. However, there is a transformational upside: Amazon’s planned $100B AI investment positions it to dominate the emerging agentic AI market by 2030, potentially offsetting tariff-driven headwinds through operational efficiencies and new revenue streams.

Title: Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech Could Jolt Markets: Evercore Warns of 15% Drop

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is slated to speak on Friday at the Fed’s annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Evercore ISI warns that market participants might not love what he has to say. Powell "is likely to indirectly signal a 25bp rate cut" at the Fed’s next policy meeting in mid-September, argued Evercore analysts led by Julian Emanuel in a note on Sunday. “For a market that was eager to embrace '50 in Sept,'" referring to market chatter about the likelihood officials would cut rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, next month, "a balanced view could catalyze a near term -7% to -15% pullback into October." "The stakes … are high with both sides of the Dual Mandate muddled," the analysts wrote, referring to the Fed’s job of balancing stable prices and maximum employment. Inflation data last week painted a muddy picture of how tariffs are affecting prices; the Consumer Price Index rose less than expected in July, while wholesale prices climbed much faster than forecast. Labor market data is not much clearer. Weekly initial unemployment claims have held steady this year. Meanwhile, job growth has fallen to its slowest 3-month pace (outside of the pandemic shock) since 2010, when the unemployment rate was about 9%, double what it is today. President Donald Trump is adding to the uncertainty. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, whom he appointed in 2019, and called on the Fed to lower rates. In early August, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after a disappointing jobs report, alarming some economists concerned that political interference could skew official economic data. High stock prices and seasonal weakness are additional causes for concern, says Evercore. "Pedal to the metal equity market bullishness in August typically runs into the realities of September," which is historically the worst month of the year for stocks, the analysts wrote. And Wall Street’s post-"Liberation Day" rally, fueled by trade deals and resilient corporate earnings, has stock valuations near their highest levels since the Dotcom Bubble. Against that backdrop, Evercore recommends investors hold a core portfolio of "AI Enablers, Adopters and Adapters" in the communication services, consumer discretionary, and tech sectors. Big names in the category include Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Micron (MU). They recommend supplementing those core holdings with attractively priced stocks with positive earnings revisions. They note healthcare companies, including Pfizer (PFE) and Cigna (CI), are overrepresented in the list of stocks that meet these criteria. They suggest funding those purchases by selling pricey stocks with less attractive earnings outlooks, including retail investor favorites like Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Strategy (MSTR).

Title: Why yearslong bear market slumps may be a thing of the past

Time Published: 2025-08-19T09:30:02Z

Probably no other term strikes the kind of fear into investors that "bear market" does. The phrase invokes imagery of the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com bust in 2000, and the 1929 crash leading into the Great Depression. In all of those cases, wealth evaporated in months and wasn't rebuilt for years. But is there really that much to fear anymore when it comes to bear markets, or declines of at least 20%? Sure, no one likes a significant market pullback, but if you stay invested, there's evidence that they may not be all that painful — and that the long, drawn-out, yearslong ruts in the market may be a thing of the past. That's according to Hank Smith, the director and head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust, which manages and consults on $15.3 billion of assets. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Smith laid out the main reason bear markets might be more short-lived going forward: A significant imbalance in the supply of shares on the market and demand for them. A few decades ago, the number of publicly listed firms in the US was over 7,000, he said. Now it's under 4,000. This number has also been shrinking relative to the US population. There are about 13 publicly listed companies per million people today, compared to 30 companies in 1996. At the same time, there is a record amount of cash — $7 trillion in money market funds — on the sidelines, he said. What's more, stock buybacks have been generally on the rise, lowering the supply of stocks available for investors to buy. In the first quarter of this year, there were $55.3 billion in stock buybacks. In the first quarter of 2019, by comparison, that number was $12.8 billion. In the first quarter of 2000, there were $7.9 billion. When there are fewer stocks available to be traded, prices tend to be more volatile. "There's been a real reduction in many companies of their shares outstanding," Smith said. "I think that's a big reason why you don't get these elongated periods of two to three years to recover from a bear market." He added: "It really is the result of supply and demand. I don't think it's much more complicated than that." Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said last week that this is the "best investing environment ever" partly due to this dynamic. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said in an interview with CNBC. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Alex Morris, the chief investment officer at F/M Investments, also recently discussed supply and demand dynamics with Business Insider. Despite a laundry list of risks to stocks — including the impact of tariffs and high valuations — the insatiable demand from investors for stocks likely means the market will continue marching higher, he said. "There's a lot of dollars floating around and they need to go somewhere," he said. "They're going to the equity market." While the sample size is small, there are a couple of pieces of evidence supporting Smith's theory, he said: the 2020 and 2022 market crashes, when the market fell 35% and 25%, respectively. In each instance, the market regained fresh all-time highs in a year or less. Of course, there were other factors at play, like unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in 2020 and the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. "This isn't like bear markets a generation or two ago that sometimes it took years to get back to the highwater mark," Smith said. "These bear markets are followed by very, very swift, powerful bull moves." Jump to

Title: Bitcoin Drops, Saylor Shops: 430 BTC Added To Treasury Stash – Details

Time Published: 2025-08-19T05:00:06Z

Strategy Inc. has bought more Bitcoin while markets wobble, adding another small slice to its vast crypto treasury. According to the company, it purchased 430 BTC for about $51.4 million, at an average price near $119,666 per coin. The move keeps Strategy in its familiar role as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. Based on the firm’s disclosure and SEC filings, the company now holds 629,376 BTC, which represents almost 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. Strategy has acquired 430 BTC for ~$51.4 million at ~$119,666 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.1% YTD 2025. As of 8/17/2025, we hodl 629,376 $BTC acquired for ~$46.15 billion at ~$73,320 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/FLRjCKDMQO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 18, 2025 Reports place the aggregate cost of that stash at about $46.15 billion. The latest 430 BTC came after the company raised money by selling stock; proceeds from STRK, STRF, and STRD share sales — roughly $19.3 million, $19 million, and $12.1 million respectively — were used to fund the purchase. Michael Saylor also hinted at new buying in a Sunday post on X, captioned “Insufficient Orange.” The fresh purchase is the third consecutive weekly buy. That pattern shows the company is sticking to a steady accumulation habit. But in the scale of its holdings, 430 BTC is tiny — a routine top-up rather than a large strategic shift. Insufficient Orange pic.twitter.com/QcRT0RTzEg — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 17, 2025 Reports have disclosed an update to the company’s Equity at-the-Market guidance tied to mNAV levels. The firm will actively issue MSTR shares when the market NAV multiple (mNAV) is above 4.0x. When mNAV sits between 2.5x and 4.0x, it will issue shares to buy more BTC. If mNAV falls below 2.5x, the company says it will prioritize paying interest on debt and funding preferred equity dividends. There is also a note that the company may consider using credit to repurchase MSTR shares when mNAV is below 1.0x. That guidance matters because issuing shares affects equity holders. Reports present this as a tool the company intends to use depending on market conditions. Bitcoin pulled back in the last week and the company’s stock fell alongside it. Bitcoin is down almost 5% in the past seven days and slid below the psychological $115,000 mark at one point. MSTR stock dropped more than 8% over the last five days, slipping from a prior close of $365 to roughly $357 in recent trading.

Title: Letters: Ukrainians just need to look to Crimea to see what reality of a ‘deal’ would be

Russian president Vladimir Putin wants to hold as much territory as possible. Photo: AP Just imagine this scenario. An aggravated burglary has taken place and your children and belongings have been taken. The leader of the pack agrees to stop assaulting you – if you let them keep what they have already taken. They may consider permitting you to install enhanced security measures in the future. Incidentally, life is hell for Ukrainians in Crimea. “Special measures” and tribunals have been set up to deal with any dissent. How did we get it so wrong? Daniel Smith, Blackrock, Co Dublin America is winning the war in Ukraine. Russia spends 7.1pc of its GDP on defence, double the US level. Russia has suffered a million casualties; the US arms industry is booming as Europe re-arms. Nato is buying US equipment to send to Ukraine. Russia has lost half its foreign income from oil and gas. The longer the war goes on, the more Russia is weakened and America is strengthened. John Doherty, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall Reports of Donald Trump’s Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, conducted not over hard diplomacy but filet mignon, halibut Olympia and green salad, ought to chill Europe more than amuse it. What is at stake is not the menu, but the spectacle of two men deciding the fate of Ukraine without Ukraine present (‘As Trump bows to Putin, Europe must prepare for the worst’, Irish Independent, August 18). The wider danger lies in the precedent. If borders and sovereignty can be redrawn in a dinner meeting, international law is reduced to table talk. The extrapolation is clear: once this becomes an acceptable mode of negotiation, other authoritarian leaders will be emboldened to test the same weakness. The prediction is bleaker still. A Ukraine carved up in Alaska may be only the first course. Moldova, the Baltics, even Taiwan, could follow as Moscow and Beijing take note of Washington’s willingness to appease under the guise of expedience. Europe, then, must prepare for the worst. To dine with Putin is one thing; to digest his terms is quite another. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Watching world politicians waffling reminds me of what the British parliamentarian Pitt the Elder said: “There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.” John Finegan, Bailieborough, Co Cavan The recent death of actor Terence Stamp reminds me of his wonderful performance in the movie Far From The Madding Crowd. Sad indeed that fellow actors in that movie, Peter Finch and Alan Bates are also since departed. It’s nice to note that the female lead, Julie Christie, is hale and hearty at 85. Indeed by his own admission, singer Tony Christie was so impressed by her, that he adopted her surname. Is there a greater compliment? Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Fionnán Sheahan writes that should former minister Heather Humphreys decide to enter the race for the Áras, she might be called on to explain “why she stepped away from politics” recently (‘Heather Humphreys is a better candidate but Simon Harris is a liability to campaign’, Irish Independent, August 18). One thing is certain, the response from the Monaghan woman will be straight and true. The office of president is “above politics”. And rightly so. Though there are those who have lost the run of themselves while holding high office, causing no end of concern for our “ordinary” political masters, as well as for the people they represent. Another contender, it’s been widely reported, has expressed “distrust” of the UK, France and Germany ­recently. Not a great start for an aspiring head of State. The incumbent has been known to “cross the constitutional boundary” more than once during his almost 14 years in the Phoenix Park. Let’s hope the next holder of the “highest office” maintains some apolitical equilibrium, save for those times that necessitate presidential intervention. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan It was worrying reading last week that a study found that for under-18s with eating disorders there was a 121pc rise in hospitalisations between 2018 and 2022 – from 170 admissions in 2018 to 375 in 2022 – with a sharp spike during the pandemic. Eating disorders are complex ­medical conditions that not only affect the young person concerned but also their loved ones, family and friends. It strikes me that wraparound care is essential, requiring an increase in investment at a national level. Not every treatment will work successfully for every person that presents at a hospital, or is diagnosed with an eating disorder. If any reader, or professional working with young people, wants an insight into this issue, I strongly recommend Evanna Lynch’s memoir: The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting. It is a harrowing, haunting, honest and unflinching account, and yet a beautifully crafted read that reflects the author’s own journey with an eating disorder that she ultimately overcomes. Let us hope these figures do not continue to rise. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo The recent attacks on members of the Indian community are abhorrent. They are also, as noted by many commentators, puzzling, as the ­Indian community continues to ­contribute so much to Irish society. The fact that they are puzzling does not make them more abhorrent. All racist attacks are abhorrent, regardless of whether the target community contributes economically or not. Chants of “Get them Out” at anti-immigration protests may legitimise and encourage these appalling attacks. We all need to be careful with our language and not tolerate any racism, taunts, slurs or “jokes”.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google readies its last stand in latest antitrust trial

12 passes left to attend the Digiday Publishing Summit This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → In the last week, the pending seismic shifts in the digital advertising landscape were underscored by Perplexity briefing the press on its intentions to capitalize on Google’s battles with the Justice Department. However, doesn’t everyone whose head office isn’t located in Mountain View, CA? The latest round of quarterly earnings calls demonstrated how companies are lining up to profit from Google’s woes. Truly, the fate of the industry will be decided in the coming days and weeks. Below is a roundup of the latest on what you need to know. Most immediately, Judge Amit Mehta’s expected remedies ruling in the Google search antitrust trial are due by the close of August, with potential Chrome bidders including Search.com and Perplexity — both of which publicized respective bids of up to $35 billion in recent days. Interest from OpenAI and Yahoo has also been noted. Elsewhere among Google’s various antitrust travails, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Google and the DOJ are entering the final stage of their ad tech antitrust battle, after Judge Brinkema earlier ruled that Google had illegally monopolized the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets, but dismissed claims related to the advertiser network. To recap, the DOJ seeks a three-phase remedy: opening data access for its ad exchange, AdX, open-sourcing the auction logic of its ad server, also known as DoubleClick for Publishers, and divesting both businesses. For its part, Google argues divestiture is not workable on several fronts, maintaining it is illegal, technically unworkable, and stifles innovation, especially as AI reshapes the sector. In recent days, both sides have submitted their witness lists for the upcoming remedies hearing in this trial, which contain dozens of names, including a slew of familiar ones, such as Andrew Casale, Arnaud Créput, Jay Friedman, Jason Kint, Stephanie Layser, and Michael Racic. Another notable (pending) name on said lists is PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel, with either side reserving the right to call further witnesses to the stand, plus call witnesses from the opposing side’s roster of experts. The remedies exhibit list of both sides also involves dozens of entries, and perhaps most tellingly (in terms of the strategic underpinning of its argument), the DOJ’s includes a blog post entitled “A new chapter for the open internet — Change is in the air,” attributed to Prebid president Mike Racic. Here, Racic issues a “call to arms”, underlining the critical role of open-source technology in fostering a more equitable ad tech ecosystem, especially following the recent ruling from presiding Judge Leonie Brinkema. According to Racic, amid regulatory shifts and rapid technological evolution, the article also rejects consolidation in favor of broad industry-wide collaboration. In it, Prebid’s Racic invites all market participants — including Google — to join a united front built on open standards and transparent practices, advocating for solutions that can be implemented swiftly, “in months, not years.” Racic also argues that an open web cannot thrive under the dominance of a single player — it requires a community. Prebid positions itself as ready to lead but calls for a collective effort among publishers, advertisers, platforms, and technologists to reshape the digital advertising landscape around transparency, interoperability, and innovation. Google counters government arguments with behavioral remedies, including AdX integration with rivals, publisher data portability, and adjustments to auction logic. Subsequently, Google’s arguments are significantly more extensive — literally, hundreds of items have been prepared and entered into the courtroom documentation — with its witnesses including James Avery, Shane Goodwin, Jason Nieh, and Scott Sheffer. The remedies-phase exhibit list also includes several items of Digiday reporting, with those submitted offering an insight into the damage-limitation tactics it intends to employ in the coming weeks. Indeed, the submissions also seem to raise the point that some of Google’s efforts in recent years were magnanimous. In particular, arguments suggest that initiatives to deprecate third-party cookies would simultaneously improve publishers’ yield while also benefiting user privacy — presumably by nudging the online ad industry to rely more on first-party data. Elsewhere, the articles for submission highlight how other behemoths of the industry have deemed the behavioral advertising sector worth a gamble during the era in debate. Take, for example, Oracle Advertising — a 10-year run that cost the company $4 billion in acquisitions, before it recently shuttered its efforts. Meta and Microsoft, although a call in the plaintiff’s favor, are notable in that neither was able to make a success of the ad-serving business, Atlas. However, such players later performed a U-turn after they deemed the juice of publisher monetization as ultimately not worth the squeeze. Nevertheless, this does not mean that Google’s policies are precluding all competition. Ironically, Amazon’s continued rise is likely to be a key weapon in Google’s defense team’s arsenal. Elsewhere, defense lawyers are likely to highlight how Google’s policies and technologies far from hamstring the sector, with investors’ eagerness to continually challenge its number one spot in the market as vindication of the sector’s robust health, not one that is hobbled by the dominance of a single entity. Of course, the outcome, regardless of how the decision turns out, is likely to set the template for the industry for the remainder of the year, with mergers and acquisitions likely on the horizon. Trial proceedings are scheduled to formally recommence on Sept. 22, 2025, after a pre-trial conference on Sept. 15. “It’s Q3. Do you know where your discounts & rebates are? This is one of the first questions I would ask my agency if I led media investments for a brand.” — Dial-up Media’s Jared Lake underlines the need for transparency in the market, emphasizing how hiding margin leads to misaligned goals, which leads to less effective outcomes. Why Reddit is pivoting from social platform to ‘go-to search engine’ with COO Jennifer Wong Reddit is positioning itself as a “go-to search engine,” integrating AI-powered Reddit Answers with core search for rollout soon. COO Jennifer Wong says the push aligns with driving measurable marketing outcomes, particularly at the mid- and lower-funnel stages. Confessions of an agency exec on using AI in global campaigns despite regulation U.S. federal lawmakers haven’t regulated AI, leaving only varied state rules, while Europe enforces stricter laws. Global brands face uncertainty as agencies weigh regulatory, structural, and cultural factors shaping generative AI’s role in marketing campaigns. AI search shakes ad tech — but here’s how companies are looking to cash in Garret Sloane at Ad Age covers how ad tech companies are bracing themselves for disruption as AI-powered search reshapes the internet experience. While the latest earnings season showed no immediate decline in web traffic, leaders at Magnite, PubMatic, Taboola, and DoubleVerify are eyeing ways to capitalize on this opportunity and turn it into the next big ad market. ANA finds programmatic ‘waste’ has increased 34% in two years MediaPost notes that while considerable improvements have been made in the efficiency of their ad spending over the past couple of years, major advertisers are losing the programmatic media-buying arms race, with the level of “wasted” ad spending rising 34% to $26.8 billion from just $20.0 billion when the Association of National Advertisers released its first benchmark in June 2023. Walmart ends data exclusivity for The Trade Desk: good news for other DSPs The chief analyst for W Media Research, Karsten Weide, opines on just what the breakup between retail media giant Walmart and The Trade Desk means for the wider ecosystem, including its own designs on the ad tech sector. A Gen Xer sold his company for $1.6 billion. He kept less than $100 million and gave the rest away because he doesn’t ‘believe in billionaires’ Ad tech doyen and Scope3 CEO Brian O’Kelley tells Fortune magazine that happiness does have a price. Brands are worried about what AI search tools represent them — and whether that can be measured and influenced. Fortunes are fluctuating, despite earnings increases across the board… time for consolidation? The adoption of AI tools like agentic offerings and smarts in new hires to power more of media agency workings continues to pick up pace.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin Adoption Grows But Success Comes With Risks
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4335366/posts
Time Published: 2025-08-19T03:33:53Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/18/2025 8:33:53 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Quote of the week: “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.” - Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

In fairness - Tulips did NOT have a 17 year bull market, like Bitcoin did. On the other hand...

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile.

Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself.

The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody.

They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy.

The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Title: My Mack Weldon underwear is still holding up after years of wearing and washing — here's why they're my absolute favorite boxer briefs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/mack-weldon-underwear-review
Time Published: 2025-08-18T20:57:31Z
Full Content:
When it comes to underwear, men have three basic options: briefs, boxer briefs, or boxers. When it comes to which brand a man chooses for his underwear, the list gets a bit longer. Actually, it gets dizzyingly long. So when I find a company making boxer briefs I love, I stock up, and I've loved every pair of boxer briefs I've gotten to try for my Mack Weldon review. So far, that's three pairs. Not a huge stock, you might say. But here's the thing — each pair is still in superb condition. Whereas other boxers from other brands have come and gone from my rotation in that time, with waistbands stretched out, fabric worn bare, and other such issues, these garments are going strong, maintaining their support, comfort, and color, too, and that despite lots of use and washes. While all of my Mack Weldon boxers are excellent overall, they each have their own qualities, so let's break things down pair by pair. These are probably the best boxer briefs I've ever tried. They have just the right fit, offering comfort and support without compression. They're not snug like, say, a pair of bike shorts, but they're a far cry from the baggy cotton boxers you wore in seventh grade. I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside). The fabric blend (50% polyamide, 33% polyester, and 17% elastane) offers plenty of stretch and wicks sweat well. The legs never bunch up with these boxers, which is much appreciated when I'm stepping into a meeting, in a shop, walking down a city street, or anywhere else where adjustments might be awkward. The 18 hours here doesn't refer to how long you can wear these boxers. You can do that for as long as you want. Instead, it refers to the period for which the fabric is allowed to rest after production prior to its use in constructing the garment. The result is a pair of boxer shorts that have a consistent, comfortable fit that won't change over time. These boxers are largely made of cotton and have a more relaxed fit, so I never use them for exercise, but for lounging at home or sleeping and taking it easy. They do ride up a bit under tighter pants, so just avoid that pairing. As with the Jersey boxers, because these boxer briefs are largely cotton, I don't recommend them for use during any intense exercise, as they just don't breathe as well as synthetic (or wool) fibers. On the other hand, these have a closer fit than the Jersey boxers, and they won't ride up your leg. Because these boxers feature antimicrobial Silver XT2 fiber, they prevent bacteria and odor build up, making them a great choice for extra-long wear, especially during travel. While hardly a bank-breaking price point, Mack Weldon's underwear is more expensive than options you'll find from myriad other brands. If you want to find decent boxer briefs for cheaper, I might recommend a three-pack from Calvin Klein for $32. On the other hand, if you don't mind paying a good deal for your boxer briefs and you want a pair with some unique support and anti-chafe features, you may want to consider the pairs we tested in our SAXX review, which offered a unique "BallPark Pouch." Also, watch out for a bit of ride up with the Jersey boxers, but you can avoid that by wearing them with looser pants and not wearing them for workouts. Mack Weldon boxer briefs have just the right fit. Each pair I have offers enough support to keep things in place but without making me feel constricted and without causing excess heat buildup. As I noted earlier, I've been weaning my three pairs in regular rotation for years now, and that means dozens and dozens of wash and dry cycles. Their colors have held, they're still stretchy and supportive, and they still grip my body evenly and don't bunch up or create lines visible through pants. Long story short, these boxer briefs are a good buy. While the price point of Mack Weldon underwear might be a bit higher than some men are used to, their value is beyond question. They are comfortable from the first wear and they hold up well over time, remaining supportive and without going threadbare, even after years of being tossed around in the laundry.

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

August 18, 2025 15:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: COLOGNE, Germany, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gamescom -- NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture is coming to GeForce NOW™, marking the cloud gaming platform’s biggest update yet. The upgrade brings NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5080-class performance, AI enhancements and cloud storage to set new standards for cloud gaming. With thousands of more games on the way, the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will deliver cutting-edge graphics and the fastest frame rates in the cloud without raising membership prices. “Bringing the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, one of the world’s most important computer graphics innovations, to GeForce NOW represents the biggest leap in cloud gaming ever,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Blackwell, GeForce NOW offers even more stunning graphics, the fastest frame rates and negligible latency to turn any device into a high-quality gaming rig that rivals nearly every other product on the market today.” Members will gain advanced features like NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, pushing streaming up to 5K resolution at 120 frames per second (fps) — previously only possible with the most advanced gaming PCs. The upgrade adds support for up to 360 fps at 1080p with NVIDIA Reflex technology and click-to-pixel response times as low as 30 milliseconds. Tapping a global network of NVIDIA SuperPODs, the majority of gamers in GeForce NOW-supported regions will see sub-30-millisecond network latency. In addition, a new Cinematic-Quality Streaming (CQS) mode uses a host of technological advancements to significantly improve image quality. Borderlands 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and The Outer Worlds 2 are among the new AAA games that will join GeForce NOW, now totaling more than 2,300 games. That number will double instantly with the launch of Install-to-Play, a feature that brings more of gamers’ PC collections to the cloud with new cloud storage. The Ultimate UpgradeThe NVIDIA Blackwell architecture features enhanced ray tracing and AI-powered rendering, enabling more realistic lighting, richer textures and faster computation to run real-time graphics for even the most demanding games. With the introduction of GeForce RTX 5080-class GPUs, the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier will deliver a stunning 62 teraflops of compute performance and a massive 48GB frame buffer, which enables AI-enhanced gaming experiences and prepares the platform for the future of AI in gaming. The latest GPU architecture offers up to 2.8x faster frame rates compared with previous-generation servers and outpaces the PlayStation 5 Pro by more than 3x. Enhanced by the latest AMD “Zen 5” CPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX®-7 SmartNICs, GeForce NOW features the most advanced hardware in cloud gaming. Plus, NVIDIA’s broadband connectivity and mobile partner network continues to grow, with new collaborations with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom AG and more. Comcast is enhancing low-latency GeForce NOW cloud gaming through the DOCSIS telecommunications standard, Deutsche Telekom AG is integrating GeForce NOW into its 5G+ network and BT Group plans to trial L4S and 5G slicing to deliver consistent, high-quality 5G performance — whether at home or on the go. Cinematic-Quality StreamingMembers will experience a noticeable leap in graphics fidelity with CQS for the highest-quality visual experiences in the cloud. CQS features a suite of technologies powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, delivering: Games MultiplierPublishers are bringing the biggest blockbusters and acclaimed indie hits to GeForce NOW, expanding its cloud library of preinstalled, ready-to-play games to over 2,300 titles. A host of AAA games will be available to play in the cloud at launch. Upcoming releases include Hell Is Us, a mystery adventure from Nacon, followed by 2K’s and Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 4 and Techland’s Dying Light: The Beast. “NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade is a game-changer for Gearbox that significantly elevates the gameplay experiences for our players,” said Brian Burleson, vice president of strategic partnerships at Gearbox Entertainment. “GeForce NOW brings the games and universes within them to almost any screen imaginable so that every last detail we’ve worked so hard on is visible. We’re proud to be part of this next era of cloud gaming.” “Castor Woods in Dying Light: The Beast is the most beautiful world we ever created, with huge improvements to dynamic lighting, physics and graphics,” said Tymon Smektała, Dying Light franchise director at Techland. “With GeForce NOW’s Blackwell architecture, these improvements will be available to more players than ever, even those without high-end PCs at home.” Gamers can also look forward to the return of the beloved sci-fi role-playing game The Outer Worlds 2 from Obsidian Entertainment; the sci-fi action of Embark Studio’s Arc Raiders; as well as the highly anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive and White Wolf. The heart-pounding Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from Activision is also joining the cloud at launch, as well as a new sci-fi third-person shooter from BigFire Games and NCSoft called CINDER CITY. “We’re focused on giving players more choice in how and where they play, and NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade helps us do that,” said Craig Duncan, head of Xbox Game Studios. “With enhanced performance and visual fidelity, it’s now easier for players to jump into their favorite worlds, connect with friends and discover new adventures.” Also new with the GeForce NOW upgrade, Install-to-Play games are made possible by cutting-edge cloud storage servers using high-performance NVIDIA NVMesh technology. Members will gain access to double the game catalog, streaming more than 2,200 additional Steam titles that publishers have enabled for cloud streaming on GeForce NOW, with more to come. This means GeForce NOW’s library will expand to over 4,500 Ready-to-Play and Install-to-Play titles. “Seeing so many AAA and indie games arriving on GeForce NOW is a great win for studios and gamers alike,” said Larry Kuperman, vice president of business development at Nightdive Studios. “Expanding the GeForce NOW library with thousands of additional Steam titles means more gamers than ever can experience our worlds — seamlessly and instantly, on nearly any device — for a true PC experience in the cloud.” Install-to-Play games are downloaded directly to cloud storage, mirroring the experience of having them on a local PC. GeForce NOW Ultimate and Performance members will receive 100GB of single-session cloud storage for Install-to-Play games at no additional cost to their membership. Members will also be able to expand their cloud storage with persistent storage add-ons: 200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month. Install-to-Play games saved in persistent storage will remain ready to launch without the need to download and reinstall for every session. More Frames on More DevicesLaunched earlier this year, GeForce RTX 5080-powered servers are giving the native GeForce NOW app on Steam Deck a performance boost from 60 to 90 fps. LG monitors and TVs are among the first to benefit from GeForce NOW RTX 5080 server upgrades. Supported LG OLED monitors can also stream in ultra-high 5K (5120×2880) when connected to Windows or macOS devices — no extra hardware needed. LG TVs are also leading the way as the world’s first to stream 4K at 120Hz with HDR through a native app on supported LG TVs. Support for popular peripherals also grows, with native support for many Logitech racing wheels offering the lowest-latency, most responsive driving experiences. In addition, the GeForce NOW Mac client will receive all the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture upgrades, turning Apple computers into high-performance gaming machines. More Easily Connect With GamersNVIDIA, Discord and Epic are partnering to transform how people discover and play games together — making it easier than ever for gamers to stay connected. Powered by NVIDIA GeForce NOW’s game streaming technology and distributed through Discord, the new integrated experience lets players try new games instantly on Discord — no downloads, installs or launchers — without missing a beat of gameplay. This new integrated experience will let gamers try Fortnite directly in Discord, if they do not have the game installed, through a limited-time trial of the GeForce NOW Performance experience — even without a GeForce NOW membership. Players only need to create or connect their Epic accounts before instantly dropping into Fortnite. The integration makes it easier for Discord’s hundreds of millions of users to discover streamed game experiences, such as Fortnite sessions, helping game developers expand their reach where conversations about games are already happening. Pricing, Availability and PromotionsThe GeForce NOW upgrade featuring the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will begin rolling out in September. GeForce NOW Ultimate remains available for $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months, and includes access to RTX 5080 servers. Performance memberships remain available at $9.99 per month or $49.99 for six months. Daily, monthly and annual membership will be available starting at launch. Annual memberships will be available for $199.99 and $99.99, respectively. To reserve a spot to be among the first to access RTX 5080-class servers on GeForce NOW, sign up for an Ultimate membership.

Title: Trump administration hopes AI can mitigate staffing losses, federal CIO says

Kevin Carter/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Trump administration is “100%” looking to artificial intelligence to make up for the loss of thousands of employees across federal agencies, a top Trump administration tech official told Nextgov/FCW in a recent interview. “I think [AI] is the number one thing that is going to help people mitigate the staffing shortages,” said Gregory Barbaccia, the chief information officer for the U.S. government, a position with oversight of the federal government's technology that’s housed within the Office of Management and Budget. Barbaccia, who's also been identifying himself as the federal chief AI officer, was a former longtime employee at data analytics company Palantir. In one of his first interviews after about eight months on the job, Barbaccia spoke with Nextgov/FCW about the administration’s vision for AI and how it intersects with the White House’s push to shrink the size of government through both layoffs and voluntary incentives. Since Trump took office in January, over 148,000 civil servants have left the federal workforce. The biggest challenge in his role, Barbaccia said, “is how to do more with less — how to still have the level of efficiency, following up on your agency’s mission for the taxpayer, operating in an environment of lean staffing.” “AI is a huge part of that, so that’s a major focus for me,” he added. Another priority is data, Barbaccia said. Enterprise data platforms — central systems connecting data from across an organization — are “what’s going to power AI and advanced analytics to actually get people [sic] more efficient,” he said. “AI is going to be a huge part of this, all these manual, repeatable tasks.” “What AI needs to be doing,” Barbaccia continued, “is collating and collecting this data that a human needs to make a decision and getting it to them in a way that makes sense, in a way that's quick, so they're able to make a decision with all the information they need as quickly as possible.” Barbaccia’s remarks come days after the launch of USAi, an evaluation platform meant to help agencies adopt AI models from Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI, some of which recently cut deals with the government to offer their software for nominal fees. Proponents of AI say it could aid the government in making sense of its vast troves of data, support federal employees and offer real-time help to people seeking government assistance without them having to call agency phone lines. “How do we use tech to take the excellent humans that we still have and make them as efficient as possible?” Barbaccia said of AI. “How do we get them doing what they were doing before, but doing it way faster and better?” The “holy grail” is “if we're automating more things that can be done by a computer, what are humans doing that they could not do before?” he added. Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service — a nonprofit focused on good government — told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that “federal leaders, as stewards of public funds, have an obligation to leverage cutting-edge technology to address our collective problems.” “The federal government can and should take concrete steps to enhance the technical capacity of its workforce to fully take advantage of all the possibilities AI has to offer,” Stier added. “The civil service needs to evolve, but it cannot be replaced by AI.” Those more critical of AI have cautioned about its potential to cause harm or automate bias at scale, a point especially relevant as the Trump administration has targeted so-called “woke” AI. Critics say that cracking down on AI tools deemed to be too woke could chill both free speech and AI-focused risk management in government agencies. There’s also questions about the reliability of the technology — generative AI models can produce plausible-seeming but ultimately false outputs called hallucinations — and the fact that many agencies have lost staff that would presumably be called upon to implement new AI solutions. “It's very early days for the use of AI in government services. But what we do know is that the approaches that work well are those where the employees drive the process of integration in a bottom up and grounded way,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign at Brown University who did a stint in the Biden administration. “What doesn't work is firing government workers who have expertise and then trying to use AI to replace their years of knowledge and experience,” Venkatasubramanian said. “And what certainly doesn't work is forcing the remaining workers to be constrained to use only AI tools that conform to Administration speech requirements. Fast is not synonymous with better, and in fact is often the opposite of it.” As for the data to power AI, the Trump administration is already pushing agencies to more easily share data, and its Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of many headlines and lawsuits over its hoovering up of government data. In the spring, Wired and CNN both reported that DOGE is building a “master database” with data from different agencies to track undocumented immigrants. The New York Times also reported on the expanded use of Palantir across the federal government. House Democrats also issued a whistleblower-informed report in April alleging that DOGE was building a cross-agency database of sensitive information from the IRS, SSA and other agencies. Barbaccia maintained that he doesn’t know of such an effort. “I can’t find it for the life of me,” he said. “I have no insight into any sort of master database going on. I asked agencies at IRS and SSA. They don't have anything they're building outside of their internal data. I've asked the vendors who are in the news, too. They're not tracking what the news is about.” “I think it’s people misunderstanding what different vendors do,” he said.

Title: Keeping Figma weird: Inside tech’s design darling after a blockbuster IPO
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/08/18/inside-figma-ipo-public-san-francisco-tech-office-tour/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T16:40:33Z
Full Content:
Two weeks ago, Figma CEO Dylan Field traveled east to do something increasingly rare for a tech leader: ring the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. His design software company, which he cofounded 13 years ago as a college student, had gone public. By day’s end, Figma was valued at roughly $68 billion — one of the most explosive IPOs in decades, joining the ranks of Uber, Airbnb, and Snowflake — Field’s net worth soared past $5 billion. (In the weeks that followed, the stock had dropped 31% and the market cap had settled in at $38 billion.) But while its founder basked in Wall Street’s embrace, at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, Figmates (as employees call themselves) faced a new challenge: retaining the company’s playful, eccentric culture without succumbing to the pressures of the public market. Figma, which creates collaborative design tools, occupies four floors of the Phelan Building on Market Street. It’s an aesthetic wonderland, with the brand’s bright colors splashed onto exposed brick columns, murals by local artists covering the walls, and vibrant rugs pulling the space together. “We try to have our brand feel similar, both digitally and physically,” said VP of design Noah Levin, who has been at Figma for eight years. “It feels kind of like a party, like a space where you want to come in and make something fun.” Unlike most other tech companies, Figma has no return-to-office mandate. But on a recent visit, hundreds of employees opted to show up in person, enjoying a catered breakfast and a pop-up Vietnamese coffee bar. One staffer typed on a laptop while petting a chihuahua-terrier mix; another chipped away at a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Employees were crowded into the office for the company’s annual “Maker Week” tradition, in which they pause regular responsibilities in favor of passion projects. The mood felt like a return to tech’s euphoric, utopian years of the 2010s — quite out of character with Silicon Valley’s current shut-up-and-grind, perk-cession era. “Figma is just a bunch of wonderfully friendly nerds solving hard problems and having fun while doing so,” said Nikolas Klein, a product manager from Germany who joined the company as an intern eight years ago. That “friendly nerd” spirit shows up in unexpected ways. During the pandemic, employees wrote and performed the 20-minute musical “Figma in Quarantine,” and the San Francisco office’s arts-and-crafts studio houses a growing crocheted quilt. Now that the company is public, its executives are trying to shield workers and the Figma culture from the demands of quarterly earnings expectations through organized play. “In normal times, the stock price probably would constantly be hanging over us,” said Sho Kuwamoto, VP of product. “But these are not normal times.” As AI allows more people to generate software without any coding background, superior product design will become a distinguishing factor, he said. “So as long as we keep helping people accomplish that, the issue of stock price will take care of itself.” When Kuwamoto joined a decade ago, Figma was located in a tiny Minna Street alley and had no product. What began as a Brown University dorm project in 2012 is now a juggernaut with 13 million monthly active users and $749 million in annual revenue. Figma’s products have become so popular that Adobe, the largest design company by market cap, planned to acquire it for $20 billion in 2023. But after antitrust pushback from the U.K. and the EU, Adobe abandoned the merger, paying Figma a $1 billion breakup fee in the process. One recent Maker Week project was hatched when five employees from various departments gathered in a 10th-floor meeting room called “Muffin Hands.” Their goal: automate the company’s meeting icebreakers. None were engineers, but within five days they had vibe-coded a working prototype — a gumball-machine-like pop-up that spits out prompts such as, “What’s your favorite way to eat potatoes?” or “What’s your best meeting with a celebrity?” “These ideas aren’t just for fun,” said Levin, who helped produce the company’s musical. “They can inform our product roadmap.” Since 2018, Figma executives have purposefully set aside time for the annual tradition centered on creativity and cross-team collaboration. Past Maker Weeks have yielded core products such as Figma Slides and an add-on for Google Classroom. “Normally at these sorts of things, engineers just get really competitive, and everyone else gets excluded,” Kuwamoto said. “Here, it is genuinely about finding joy in your work. That’s how you get the best output out of people.” Five years ago, Figma employed about 150 people and just one outside the U.S., in London. Today, the company has 1,600 employees at eight global offices in addition to its San Francisco headquarters. As it continues to grow, Chief People Officer Nadia Singer is being intentional about preserving the company culture. “There are some things we want to evolve, but there are some things we want to keep forever,” Singer said. Those include not only the ability to deal with ambiguity but the potential for ideas to come from anywhere. Kylie Chang joined Figma this summer as an intern, helping to build AI enhancements for the company’s tools. What stood out about the 19-year-old’s résumé wasn’t her Ivy League pedigree but that she started playing around with Figma in middle school and used it to design an app that functioned as a virtual museum for her artwork. “It’s easy to strike up conversations here and ask for help,” Chang said. “It’s surreal getting to work on a product I grew up using all my life.” And did she get stock options? “I was paid in great memories,” she said.

Major U.S. equities indexes were little changed Monday morning, ahead of retail sector earnings reports and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell due later in the week. Dayforce (DAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 following a report that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is in discussions to acquire the human resources software provider. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) also advanced after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s popular Wegovy weight-loss medicine to treat a serious liver disease. First Solar (FSLR) and other solar stocks gained in the wake of new guidance from the Treasury Department on federal tax incentives for clean energy projects. Citi and Jefferies analysts said the release was better than anticipated. CVS Health (CVS) shares rose following an upgrade from UBS, which pointed to the drugstore and healthcare company’s cost-cutting and improving healthcare benefits division. EQT (EQT) shares fell as the energy provider was downgraded from Roth Capital Partners on concerns an oversupply of natural gas will send prices down and hurt EQT’s results. Oil and gold futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. TradingView

Title: Who Killed the Narrative Podcast?

Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:51:05Z

By Eric Benson “I have a hook for your story,” a podcast producer told me as soon as I called her up earlier this summer. “Pineapple Street announced it’s going out of business today.” I’d already been reporting on the collapse of the narrative podcast industry for several weeks, talking with executives and editors and producers. Everyone had pretty much the same thing to say: things were looking grim. But this news felt personal. I’d hosted and written two shows for Pineapple Street Studios. I had several close collaborators who were still on staff. Even when I was just a fan of podcasts, I knew the name Pineapple Street — it was a pioneering production company and industry leader. They’d made the mega-hit Missing Richard Simmons in 2017, then spent almost a decade churning out award-winning narrative shows like The Catch and Kill Podcast, Ghost Story, and Hysterical. A few years ago, Pineapple Street going out of business would have shocked me. But when I heard about its demise on that Thursday afternoon in June, it felt sad but inevitable. If you haven’t been paying close attention, the idea that a segment of the podcast industry is existentially imperiled may seem counterintuitive. More people than ever are listening to podcasts and talking about podcasts and thinking about starting their own podcasts. Politicians trying to win elections are clamoring to go on podcasts. (When they lose, it is blamed, in part, on not going on the right podcasts.) A recent report from Edison Research estimates that 55 percent of Americans over the age of 12 consumed a podcast in the last month, an all-time high. But the podcasts that are thriving are talk shows — increasingly celebrity-driven talk shows — that are cheap to make, can easily be turned into streaming YouTube videos, and command big ad dollars. Narrative podcasts — the multi-episode, investigative journalism–fueled shows that boomed after the release of Serial in October 2014 — have followed an inverse trajectory. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century For years, narrative podcasts were the buzziest segment of the industry. They were what many listeners thought of when they heard the word “podcast.” Many of these shows, following the lead of Serial, were true crime, while others, like Slow Burn, took a similar investigative approach to politics and history. But regardless of genre, most narrative shows shared a style — they were told through the perspective of a single reporter-host, who not only guided a listener through a story but invited them along on the reporting journey. Now, these shows seem increasingly like an artifact of history. Layoffs have hit nearly every organization that makes this kind of audio, from corporate behemoths like Spotify to successful start-ups like Pushkin Industries to the public-radio godfather of it all, This American Life. In early August, Amazon announced it was dismantling Wondery, one of the biggest and most commercially successful studios in the business, which had made its name on shows like Dr. Death and The Shrink Next Door. Amazon had acquired Wondery less than five years ago for $300 million. Now, the company was being broken up into parts and a reported 110 staffers were laid off. “It feels like podcasts speed-ran the development of an industry to the decline of an industry,” the journalist and podcast host Evan Ratliff told me. “It went from people were making absolutely no money, to people were making fortunes big enough where they’d never have to work again, to ‘There’s not a budget for that’ in less than 10 years.” Now, even those reduced budgets have vanished. The fall of the industry has been so vertiginous that it’s been hard to fully comprehend its decline. But in many ways, this collapse was baked into its spectacular rise, when a flood of dumb money, pollyannaish entrepreneurs, and hungry journalists rushed to build an industry that would soon turn into a house of cards. YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MAKING podcasts, I thought I was already too late to get in on the craze. This was the mid-2010s, and after Serial, it felt like every other month brought another expertly crafted narrative series. There was the first season of In the Dark, and S-Town, and Missing Richard Simmons—podcasts that not only got millions of listeners but were covered in the mainstream media as events. They got picked over, debated on social media. They felt like they mattered. So when my friend Matthew Shaer asked me if I might be interested in making a podcast with him in the spring 2017, I leapt at the opportunity. Related Content 'The Yogurt Shop Murders' Director on the 'Cursed' Story That Haunts Austin 30 Years Later Four Things We Learned From Netflix’s New Son of Sam Docuseries They Were Accused of a Brutal Murder. Can She Prove Their Innocence? Margo Price Keeps the ‘Bastards’ at Bay on Rolling Stone's New Podcast ‘Nashville Now’ Matt told me he’d happened upon a story about a Florida State University law professor named Dan Markel who had been shot to death outside his home in Tallahassee in 2014. Two alleged hitmen had been charged in the case, but authorities believed the masterminds behind the murder were family members of Markel’s ex-wife. Matt had tried to pitch it xas a magazine story, but he’d struck out, which turned out to be a lucky break. The Markel case was convoluted, had tons of backstory, and there was hours of archival audio from police wiretaps and stings. In other words, it was perfect for a podcast. Matt and I spent months developing the idea, then we pitched it to Wondery, which was fresh off its first big hit, Dirty John. Within a couple weeks, we’d signed a contract to make a six-episode show. We wanted to call it Tallahassee. Wondery’s CEO Hernan Lopez, a shrewd former television executive, opted instead for the crass but grabby Over My Dead Body. He said he liked titles that were phrases people actually said. In mid-February 2019, the night before Over My Dead Body was released, Wondery hosted a launch party at the Ace Hotel in New York. They billed it as the “exclusive world premiere of 2019’s next blockbuster.” Lopez, Wondery’s CEO served as master of ceremonies, insisting that all the attendees blindfold themselves while listening to the first episode. Afterward, Matt and I went to dinner with Marshall Lewy, Wondery’s chief content officer, who told us about his attempt to court an Oscar-nominated screenwriter to adapt Over My Dead Body. That particular screenwriter had declined, but it hardly mattered. The show hit number one on the Apple podcast charts and stayed there for weeks. That summer, the actress and director Elizabeth Banks optioned the show for development. In 2019, the movie and TV industry just couldn’t resist a good podcast. “My friends in Hollywood would be like, ‘People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about graphic novels or comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies,’” Jenna Weiss-Berman, the co-founder of Pineapple Street, tells me. “Then everyone was like, cool, this is going to be an amazing business.” “People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies” In truth, narrative podcasts had always been a strange business. Requiring months (and sometimes years) of reporting and an exhaustive writing and editing process, they were expensive to produce and struggled to attract enough advertising to pay for their budgets. (Weekly chat shows, with their consistent audiences and parasocial relationships between host and listener, were always a safer bet.) The Hollywood money could help close the gap, and when a show struck big like Wondery’s The Shrink Next Door — which had a purchase price of $1.25 million and numerous associated bonus fees — narrative podcasts could turn a tidy profit. But podcasting still seemed like a relatively modest offshoot of magazines and public radio. Then Big Tech changed the math entirely. A week before the Over My Dead Body launch party, Spotify announced that it was acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet for a reported $230 million. Spotify had been looking to reduce its dependency on record labels while also becoming a one-stop shop audio company, and Gimlet — which made highly produced shows — was a key plank in that strategy. To most people in the industry, Spotify buying Gimlet made sense, but Spotify buying Gimlet for $230 million seemed, to quote one longtime producer, “totally insane.” (As Brian Reed, the host of S-Town, noted to me, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a similar sum in 2013. ”A five-year-old podcast company being valued at the same amount as one of the biggest legacy media brands ever — that, to me, encapsulates the bubble we were in,” Reed says.) Gimlet had routinely struggled with profitability. Now, their founders and investors had cashed out for a quarter-billion dollars. ”It was like Spotify dropped a wallet in the street and Gimlet picked it up — it could’ve been any of us,” one former podcast executive told me. It wasn’t long before other wallets started dropping. In August 2019, Pineapple Street, a considerably smaller company than Gimlet, sold to Entercom (later rebranded Audacy) for $18 million. In July 2020, the New York Times bought Serial Productions for a reported $25 million. That December, Amazon announced its $300 million bet on Wondery. These companies weren’t buying narrative podcast shops because they thought narrative podcasts were a can’t-miss business. They saw them as part of their grand corporate maneuverings. One former Pineapple Street staffer tells me an Entercom executive had said during the acquisition, “We don’t need you to make money. We want you to make shows we can brag about.” Soon, Sony, Apple TV+, and Amazon were aggressively commissioning narrative podcasts from independent producers, too. New companies like Campside Media (co-founded by my Over My Dead Body reporting partner Matthew Shaer) cropped up to feed the beast, churning out narrative series for the big players while hoping they might follow Pineapple Street and Serial Productions and get acquired for a spectacular fee. As money swelled the ranks of the industry, it also gave it a sense of staying power. Narrative podcasts couldn’t be written off as a fad. They were a new medium, the savior of longform storytelling. A day after Spotify acquired Gimlet, the National Magazine Awards unveiled the finalists for their first-ever podcasting prize. Later that year, the Pulitzer Prizes announced they were adding an “audio reporting” category. Podcast hosts like Serial‘s Sarah Koenig and S-Town’s Brian Reed were going on late-night shows. Hulu was launching its Emmy-winning comedy series about true-crime podcasters, Only Murders in the Building. Big-time print journalists like The New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe were jumping into the world of narrative podcasts and loving it. Keefe tells me that not only was making his show, Wind of Change, one of the “happiest, most creatively fulfilling experiences” of his career, but he saw audiences respond to it in a lasting way. “On book tour, there are always people who show up, having read none of my books, and want to talk about Wind of Change,” Keefe says. I was feeling optimistic too. Over My Dead Body had been just the beginning for me. I made a campaign-trail podcast for Texas Monthly called Underdog: Beto v. Cruz; I was reporting and writing the investigative true-crime series Suspect and executive producing a story of drug-smuggling and police corruption called Witnessed: Borderlands. Then there was my show Project Unabom, about the 18-year manhunt to find Ted Kaczynski, which I’d gotten greenlit off a pitch that was barely a paragraph long. I was busier than I’d ever been, and I was already discussing new projects that would keep me occupied for the next 18 months. At the time, I was a staff writer for Texas Monthly, which had once seemed like a dream job. But in December 2020, I quit. I wanted to write and produce podcasts full time. I had caught the bug. I wasn’t the only one. IN THE SUMMER OF 2016, Connie Walker was looking for a new way to tell stories. She was a television reporter at the CBC News in Toronto, where she specialized in covering indigenous issues. She had a big audience, but she also found that she was frustrated by the quick-hit nature of TV news. Walker is Cree and grew up in the Okanese First Nation in rural Saskatchewan, and she wanted to bring history and context into her stories. Almost always, she had to leave that on the cutting room floor. Podcasts had been a revelation. She’d gotten hooked on Serial and was inspired by its immersive approach to storytelling. So she pitched her bosses on a podcast about the unsolved 1989 murder of Canadian woman from the Gitxsan nation. Walker’s bosses were television people. They’d never overseen a podcast before, but they cautiously agreed. She had a tight deadline and a tiny team, but plenty of editorial freedom to tell the story of an indigenous community in the way she wanted. “I think for a long time there was just this feeling that our stories weren’t important or that Canadians wouldn’t care,” Walker tells me. “And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams? debuted that fall, and it quickly found an audience. Walker tracked the ins and outs of the case, but she was after something larger: “We started this story looking for answers about Alberta Williams’ unsolved murder, but the deeper we got into the story the more I thought about the bigger questions,” Walker says at the beginning of the fourth episode. “Why are there over 1,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada? My hope in telling Alberta’s story is to begin to connect the dots.” “For a long time there was this feeling that our stories weren’t important. And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Within a couple months of the show’s release, Walker was connecting even more dots, reporting a new season that tracked her search for a long-ago missing Cree girl named Cleopatra Semaganis Nicotine. But midway through production, Walker’s manager told her that it would be her last podcast. “She was like, ‘This takes too long. It’s too expensive. This is it,’” Walker says. And I was like, ‘it hasn’t even come out yet.’ And she said, ‘management doesn’t support it.’ Missing & Murdered: Finding Cleo was a breakout hit, but the CBC stuck to its decision. Walker went back to making television, but soon she was looking for a new employer. In the summer of 2019, she was invited to meet with a few executives at Gimlet, which had just been acquired by Spotify. As soon as she walked into their Brooklyn offices, she was wide-eyed. The CBC offices looked like what you’d expect from a public broadcaster — drab carpeting, dated computers, refrigerators full of sad office lunch. Gimlet’s offices were all start-up pizzazz — designer furniture, gleaming cutting-edge equipment, break rooms stocked with free sparkling water and a cornucopia of snacks. Even better, Gimlet offered Walker its full editorial backing. “I was begging at the CBC, like ‘Please let me,’ and with Gimlet it was like, ‘What can we do to support you and your vision of the podcast?” Walker says. “It really was like a dream come true.” Walker’s Gimlet show, Stolen, continued the work she’d started with Missing & Murdered. In the first season, she investigated the recent disappearance of a young mother named Jermain Charlo, but in the second season, Walker broke the mold, focusing on a mystery involving her own father, Howard Cameron, and the abuse he and his peers suffered at the St. Michael’s Residential School, which had been established as part of a government policy of forced assimilation. It was a dark, personal story, and Gimlet gave Walker the time and the team to pursue the most ambitious work of her career. Gimlet’s largesse was worth it. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s won nearly every award for which it was nominated, including the Peabody and the Pulitzer. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was one of the strongest cases imaginable for the existence of narrative podcasts. The resources at Gimlet had allowed a reporter to investigate a deeply personal story, then broaden the scope until she’d crafted a furious indictment of institutional abuse and racism. Just as importantly, the behind-the-scenes transparency of the medium had taken what could have been a dry exercise in accountability journalism and injected it with the sizzle and suspense of a police procedural. And the voices of the survivors themselves gave it an intimacy and force that would have been almost impossible in another medium. But when Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was winning the biggest awards in audio journalism, Walker’s triumph was tempered by the fact that Gimlet itself was a husk of its former self. The problems had burst into public view two years earlier with accusations that one of Gimlet’s flagship shows, Reply All, had created a hostile work environment for non-white staffers. That had led to a reckoning inside the company and, within a little over a year, the end of Reply All. Other longtime Gimlet shows, which were siloed as “Spotify exclusives” and unavailable on other platforms, started bleeding their audiences. New shows had trouble gaining traction. In October 2022, Spotify, under pressure from investors to reduce costs, began culling its original podcast offerings, cancelling several Gimlet shows and laying off dozens of staffers. By the end of that year, Gimlet’s managing director, Lydia Polgren, and its co-founders, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber, had all departed the company. Then in June 2023, less than a month after Walker’s Pulitzer and Peabody wins, Spotify shut down Gimlet and put its few remaining shows under the mantle of Spotify Studios. In just four years, Spotify had turned $230 million into zero dollars. Spotify spared Stolen for a few months, but that December, it too was cancelled. The news wasn’t a surprise to Walker. “I feel like we knew kind of before we knew,” she says. She and her team were allowed to stay on and finish their third season, Stolen: Trouble in Sweetwater, but when its final episode was released in April 2024, they were all out of work. In some ways, this was familiar terrain for Walker, echoing her experience with the CBC. But the podcast industry was in a vastly different place in the summer of 2024 than it had been in the summer of 2019. Gone were the days when studios like Gimlet were flush with cash and hungry to buy up new talent. When Spotify cancelled Stolen and another former Gimlet show, Heavyweight, a company spokesperson said they would “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.” But there was nowhere to go next for Stolen. When Walker reached out to podcast studios and media companies, they didn’t try to woo her at their venture capital-funded offices. She couldn’t get anyone to make her an offer at all. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s had felt like undeniable proof of what she’d been trying to convince people of for her entire career — “that these stories are important, that there’s an audience, and that they can have an impact.” But that moment had faded. Two months after Spotify cancelled Stolen, the company signed a new $250 million deal with Joe Rogan. THE NARRATIVE PODCAST INDUSTRY HAD always been an awkward mash-up of characters — public-radio true believers, Hollywood producers, magazine refugees, and eventually tech executives — and it had always been a little unclear what the goal of making these shows really was. Were they entertainment or journalism? Should their success be measured in awards and social impact, or by their ability to turn a buck? Did these podcasts exist principally for their listening audiences, or were they really, when you got down to it, just proof of concept for film and television development? The different segments of the industry always had different answers to these questions, but for a time, while the money was flowing, it felt like podcasts could be everything to everyone. The precious journalists could strive for their Pulitzers, and the wannabe Ari Golds could have their Hollywood deals. The answer to every binary choice was “yes.” But then the money started to go away. The tech and media giants that had funded the podcast boom had learned that narrative journalism was hard to scale. In 2019, it might have been enough for them to make shows that “we can brag about,” but a few years later, as recession fears grew, losing money on prestige programming no longer seemed like a good idea. “Podcasting has been a drag on the gross margin side,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in January 2023, “Some shows worked, some didn’t perform as we expected. And that is a sign of maturing. You go for growth first and then you seek efficiency.” As 2023 went on, Ek and his competitors tacked hard toward efficiency. “Places that were buying these shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000?’” Weiss-Berman, the Pineapple Street co-founder, told me. “Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” For years, the industry had been building itself up on the premise that the demand would only grow for prestige TV-like narrative shows and budgets would remain robust. When the big tech companies cut back, the first solution for the production companies that depended on them was mass layoffs. The second was closing up shop entirely. For anyone making a living in podcasting, the future started to look like finding a new line of work. “Places that were buying shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000? Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” At the beginning of this year, that’s how it was looking to me. I’d spent much of the previous two years writing and producing two shows that had both been killed by their commissioning companies. They weren’t bad. I’m pretty sure they were good. But they didn’t sound exactly like something that had come before, which meant they weren’t easily slotted into a pre-existing feed. By then, a conservatism had set in. The industry of “yes” was now beginning to resemble the worst of Hollywood. Creative executives, under pressure to churn out hits, were increasingly micromanaging the process, engaging in what one award-winning host described to me as a “firing line approach to editing.” In February, I finished up a show that actually got released, the Wondery podcast Death County, PA, which had showcased the high-impact prison reporting of the journalist Joshua Vaughn. Then, for the first time since 2018, I faced a world in which I had no offers for new podcast work. But I don’t know if I’m done with podcasts, even if a certain kind of corporate-backed, lavishly budgeted narrative show appears to be extinct. My favorite podcast from the last 12 months is called Shell Game, and in many ways it’s a playbook for what might come next. Hosted and reported by Evan Ratliff, a longtime tech journalist and one of the hosts of the Longform podcast, Shell Game is an experimental series about artificial intelligence, and in many ways, it’s a rejection of the compromises that had become baked into making shows for Big Podcast. “I knew it was going to weird,” Ratliff says. “And I wanted to be as weird as possible. I didn’t want to be forced into analytic conclusions about AI, the kind of places you get pushed by people who are trying to sell your show.” Of course, by the spring of 2024, when Ratliff started making Shell Game, he probably wouldn’t have found anyone to fund it anyway. But that was fine. Ratliff figured he could do it cheaply with a small team. He hired Sophie Bridges, a producer he’d worked with previously, and leaned on the expertise of his wife, Samantha Henig, who had founded and led the audio division of the New York Times. The tiny team didn’t diminish the quality of the show. And part of what’s so wonderful about Shell Game is it’s a story that could only exist as a podcast. Ratliff created an AI voice clone of himself and set it loose in the world. In the show, we hear AI Evan interact on the phone, often hilariously, with a series of interlocutors, starting with customer service representatives and scammers and building to two sessions with an unwitting human therapist via the online platform Better Help. Shell Game made several best-of-the-year lists, and Ratliff says it broke even. (The revenue came almost entirely from subscriptions to an affiliated Substack.) Then, it won a $50,000 prize from the Independent Media Initiative, which made it profitable. But breaking even is a tough business model, and prize money isn’t something you can count on. For Season Two of Shell Game, Ratliff is collaborating with the independent podcast studio Kaleidoscope, which has given him more a financial cushion while still allowing him to make the show he wants to make. “They’re into telling a story that sounds as far from any formula as possible and helping us try to do that,” Ratliff said. That’s how the future might look: smaller, more independent, more experimental, but also with fewer shows being made and basically no hope of striking rich. But that future is hard to see from the present. At the moment, the narrative podcasts that are making it to the top of the Apple charts are tabloid-y true-crime, often affiliated with TV shows like Dateline and 20/20. Pineapple Street has vanished, Wondery has been gutted, and many of the surviving production companies are trying desperately to pivot to weekly chat shows. Nearly every producer and editor I worked with in podcasting — across seven years and 12 shows — is struggling to find work. Some are piecing together freelance gigs doing field reporting for news-radio outlets. A few are staffing chat shows. One talented producer I know is now working for a fly-fishing magazine. Another started a successful food Substack. An entire generation of journalists who started in podcasting are leaving and are unlikely to return. And many of the most respected and experienced producers, editors, and reporters in the industry are out in the cold too. Connie Walker is one of them. When I spoke to Walker in late June, she was about to start a new job as a journalism professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. There, she’d be continuing the work she began in Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s, collecting the testimony of residential school survivors and building out an archive of the abuses that took place. That work is certainly worthwhile, but when we spoke, Walker was open about the fact that her “new dream” was to turn that work into another podcast. In retrospect, the boom years of narrative podcasting were always a kind of dream. When she went to Gimlet, Connie Walker felt like she’d won the lottery. Sometimes I felt like I had, too. Now, that era is definitively over. A few people got rich. Many more came out the other side with no job, and if they were lucky, a few months severance. Whatever comes next will be built up in the shadow of that history — that it all looked so good and that so many of us bought into the mirage. We want to hear it.

Title: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/18/meta-stock-path-to-2x-growth/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:10:21Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META stock (NASDAQ: META) has delivered 2x returns, rising from $370 in early 2024 to roughly $785 today. The company’s evolution into an AI-driven advertising leader, together with Instagram’s revenue strength and substantial infrastructure spending, creates several avenues for the stock to potentially double again. At just 28x trailing earnings versus Amazon’s 35x and Microsoft’s 38x, Meta screens as compelling value with meaningful upside. We’ll examine these drivers below. While META has rallied, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception. Also, see – What's Happening With UNH Stock? Meta’s recent results show accelerating growth across key lines. Q2 2025 revenue reached $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, and net income climbed 36% to $18.3 billion. Operating leverage is especially visible in advertising, where revenue hit $46.6 billion, a 21.5% increase. The 9% rise in average price per ad underscores Meta’s ability to command premium pricing through AI-enhanced targeting. Also, see – Meta’s Revenue Comparison. Meta’s core shift centers on AI embedded throughout its advertising stack. Llama models now drive ad ranking and content recommendations, marking a move from conventional social media ads to precision marketing. This is not merely a technical upgrade—it is producing tangible business results, with pricing power expanding quarter after quarter. The scale goes well beyond automation. Meta’s generative AI tools are gaining traction with users and advertisers, opening new revenue opportunities while optimizing existing placements. This positions Meta at the forefront of the industry’s transition to AI-powered marketing solutions. Instagram is Meta’s most valuable asset and fastest-growing revenue engine. The platform is on track to generate over half of Meta’s U.S. advertising revenue in 2025, up from just 7% a decade ago. This mix shift toward a higher-margin platform creates substantial room for profitability gains. Given that Meta’s global advertising revenue exceeded $160 billion in 2024, with nearly 40% from North America, international monetization remains a significant opportunity. As Instagram expands globally and rolls out new features, it provides a clear path for sustained revenue growth. Meta’s 2025 capital plans include state-of-the-art AI infrastructure, highlighted by a 5-gigawatt data center and over one million graphics processors. While the upfront spend is sizable, these investments help cement leadership in AI-driven ad optimization. The in-house Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program signals a push toward cost efficiency. By replacing older GPU-based servers with custom silicon, Meta can lower long-term infrastructure costs while boosting AI performance—building a durable edge in the AI arms race. Despite cumulative losses exceeding $60 billion since 2020, Reality Labs remains Meta’s largest untapped growth option. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called 2025 a “pivotal year for the metaverse,” suggesting a potential turn from pure investment to revenue generation. Although the division posted $4.5 billion in Q2 losses, a successful transition could unlock meaningful value. Hardware sales, virtual experiences, and “personal superintelligence” applications could create entirely new revenue streams over time. For Meta to double from here, the company needs consistent revenue growth of 15–20% annually alongside margin expansion. Key levers include using AI to further lift ad performance, scaling generative AI across platforms, monetizing new surfaces like Threads, and enhancing WhatsApp’s business features. Financial scenarios suggest revenue could surpass $265 billion within three years, with earnings nearly doubling from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028. Even holding current valuation multiples steady, the stock could exceed $1,300 in three to four years. If investors assign higher multiples on stronger AI execution and profitability, shares could reach $1,500 or more—constituting a true doubling from today’s levels. The biggest challenge is intensifying AI competition. Cost-efficient offerings like DeepSeek raise the question of whether Meta’s large-scale infrastructure will preserve its technological moat. Regulatory scrutiny of social platforms could also restrict data monetization, particularly in Europe and Asia. Macroeconomic risks matter as well. A downturn could weigh on ad budgets across Facebook and Instagram, and higher interest rates may make growth stocks like META less appealing than fixed income. Related – Buy or Fear META Stock? Meta’s path to a potential doubling hinges on successful monetization of its AI investments. Its dominance in social advertising, paired with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, provides multiple routes to sustained growth. The opportunity is real, but execution risk is elevated as competition intensifies across core markets. For growth-oriented investors comfortable with single-stock volatility, META offers compelling upside. Those seeking steadier exposure to similar themes might prefer diversified options like the High Quality Portfolio, which participates in Meta’s growth story while managing concentration risk through broader exposure.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here.

Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing. Note: You can’t predict exactly what your customers will ask, and there are infinite ways they can do it. But thinking about prompts — not just keywords — will put you in a good place to be able to optimize your ecommerce pages for LLMs. Think in layers: This is how you start to think of your items like answers and solutions, not just products. Let this prompt structure inform your: LLMs can pull from all of it — so make sure you’re using the kind of language your real customers use everywhere. Even if your site is crawlable, your schema is perfect, and your feed is super optimized — LLMs still learn about your brand based on what people are saying about you elsewhere. They’re trained on massive web-scale datasets, so third-party content — like reviews, Reddit mentions, YouTube transcripts, forums, blog posts — can carry as much (or more) weight than your owned channels. If you want to show up in AI answers, your brand needs to already exist in the wider conversation. AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude all lean on third-party review sites and forums in their answers to brand and product-related queries. These are the places you’ll want to show up in order to be included in those answers: Showing up in these places is half the battle. The other component is how you show up. Ideally, you’ll want to be mentioned alongside competitors (“like Brooklinen but…”). And in the right, relevant context (“these are some of the best cooling sheets for eczema”). A lot of this is going to be completely out of your control (especially on platforms like Reddit). But good marketing practices can make it more likely that people will naturally talk about your brand in the way you want them to. Gaining LLM visibility is a byproduct of an effective multichannel marketing strategy. If you’re running a strong content program, building brand awareness, and actively participating in your category — you’re already seeding relevance. What’s new is the urgency: LLMs are already using these signals to decide which brands deserve to be recommended. Related: See our LLM Seeding Playbook for tactics, templates, and outreach strategies. In traditional SEO, visibility was deterministic: rank #1 for a keyword, get X% of clicks. That model is breaking. AI-powered discovery works differently. Your brand might appear in one version of a response, but not the next. Whether your ecommerce store is included depends on how the user phrases their prompt, how much brand recognition you have, and how often you’re referenced across the web. So, your measurement strategy needs to adapt. Start by building a prompt library — real questions your customers might ask: Here’s how it looks in Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit: For each prompt, ask: Over time, this gives you a clearer picture of how visible your brand is across different use cases. AI-driven search is already reshaping how people discover products. The shift is subtle now, but it won’t stay that way for long. What used to be a clear SEO vs. paid search strategy is now blending into a broader question: When someone asks a smart machine what to buy… will it know you exist?

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery.

Title: The 100 Best Movies of the 1970s

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Listing the best movies of a given decade has become something of an IndieWire tradition over the last few years, starting with the countdown we put together for our ’90s Week extravaganza in 2022, continuing with the ’80s the following year, and… then abruptly jumping forward in time to the ’00s the year after that. The problem wasn’t that we don’t love ’70s cinema — the problem was that we love ’70s cinema way too much. And way too much of it. The prospect of putting together a top 100 list that still didn’t have room for the likes of “M*A*S*H,” “Brewster McCloud,” The Long Goodbye,” or “California Split” seemed deeply perverse, and that’s just accounting for the work of a single filmmaker. No “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”? No “That Obscure Object of Desire”? No “House,” “Holy Mountain,” or “Half a Loaf of Kung Fu”!? It’s hard to even see the point of trying, and some of you might find it that much harder after parsing the movies that ultimately made the cut now that we’ve finally decided to wrap our hands around one of the most vital — and turbulent — decades the movies have known thus far. Born from the chaos of the 1960s and screaming headlong into a future that still seemed to be up for grabs (even as fears, optimistically dubbed “paranoid,” began to deepen about the powers that really hold this planet in their grip), the films of the ’70s reflect a world that was trying to make sense of its own violent potential. It was a time of ecstatic creativity that saw the emergence of New Hollywood, blaxploitation, and a blockbuster culture that was more compelled by greatness than opening weekend grosses; that saw American cinema look up to the stars with one eye and back down towards its own past with the other. It was also a time of profound reckoning, as established giants like Med Hondo, Nagisa Ōshima, and Pier Paolo Pasolini confronted the rot of history with a clarity and fearlessness that has seldom been seen since. And perhaps more than anything else, it was a time of cocaine. Just incredible amounts of cocaine. In a decade whose movies were so vast and varied, cocaine might be the only thing that many of the ones on this list ultimately have in common. Cocaine and Al Pacino. So after much consternation we present to you, at last, IndieWire’s list of the 100 Best Movies of the 1970s. This article includes contributions from: Carlos Aguilar, Christian Blauvelt, Sam Bodrojan, Wilson Chapman, Jake Cole, Rance Collins, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Alison Foreman, Proma Khosla, Ryan Lattanzio, Vikram Murthi, Tambay Obenson, Katie Rife, and Christian Zilko. IndieWire’s ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street’s “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY’ is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre’s ’70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22. A film like “The Sugarland Express” is proof that some legends are just built different. Directing his first theatrically released film at 28 years old, Steven Spielberg practically emerged from the womb with all of the characteristics that would make him the biggest Hollywood director of the next half century: the effortless command of spectacle that always knows when to take a backseat to storytelling, the buttery smooth camera movements that seamlessly shift focus without ever letting viewers know it’s happening, and his unapologetic sincerity and deep belief in the dreams of brighter days that Hollywood has always sold us. Many a modern viewer has watched “The Sugarland Express” expecting a trail of breadcrumbs that point to the development of a more mature Spielberg who directed his best films, but its pleasures are more immediate than that — “The Sugarland Express” is one of his best films, full stop. In Goldie Hawn’s Lou Jean, a young mom who will stop at nothing to get her baby out of the foster system, Spielberg found one of his most endearing protagonists. Her endless love, refusal to accept defeat, and good humor about the ridiculousness of riding in a cop convoy while holding an officer at gunpoint makes the character impossible to root against, and Spielberg is often happy to sit back and let Hawn’s charisma do all the hard work for him. “The Sugarland Express” is Spielberg at his funniest and most sincere, complete with stellar car chase sequences that foreshadow his blockbuster dominance, and beautiful shots of characters watching “Looney Tunes” that may well have laid the foundation for Sammy Fabelman’s eventual trips to the movies. Its legacy has been overshadowed by the colossal movies its director has made in the subsequent decades, but the film would be just as deserving of a spot on this list if Spielberg had never stepped behind the camera again. —CZ Agnès Varda’s “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” is a musical about women’s rights, at once both polemical in its borderline-Brechtian lyrics championing birth control and body autonomy, and also eternally playful and inquisitive in the naturalistic study of its central duo’s friendship over many years. Classmates Pauline and Suzanne drift together and apart through the vagaries of life, each following a wildly different path but always retaining a connection to the other. Among other things, it is one of the most gently observed movies ever made about female friendship. One of Varda’s boldest experiments, the film blends various genres and styles. Inspired by a real abortion case, the film incorporates neorealist traits to the extent it casts one of the actual lawyers to recreate the court proceedings, but Varda also sidesteps into gorgeous tableaux vivants and adopts immersive editing patterns to convey the characters’ sense of time passing. And the occasional bursts of song add a dash of whimsy to topics the director takes seriously, using humor and warmth to bring into the open subjects that were still largely taboo in French society. —JC In a way, Edward Anhalt and John Milius’s script for “Jeremiah Johnson” crystallizes what Westerns have been chasing ever since: It’s spare, unfussy, and full of poetic character. But for all the ways in which “Jeremiah Johnson” has proven enduring and influential, this under-appreciated classic is a truly singular film at heart — a portrait of a true ‘70s loner who just happens to be living in the Rocky Mountains in the 1840s. Drawing inspiration from period vernacular and the poetry of Carl Sandburg, Anhalt and Milius’s script is laser-focused on the search for what really matters in life, and the search that happens within oneself. Director Sydney Pollack, proving his extraordinary range and gifts, opened himself up as well to find this movie in the edit, a seven-and-a-half month assembly process following a shoot all over the snowy wilds of Redford’s adopted state of Utah. Far more than “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “Jeremiah Johnson” is the real birth of Sundance — many of the landscapes here seem just a stone’s throw from Main Street in Park City. The result is both purposeful in the writing and loose enough to let in a real feeling of life, the kind of experiential rhythm that you can’t find in a studio. This is as quiet and most introspective as Westerns get. It also has one of the ultimate ‘70s cinematic moments, an instant that sums up the spirit of the decade onscreen better than maybe any other bit of dialogue. While those opposed to the Vietnam War burned their draft cards, Jeremiah Johnson deserts the army altogether, who were then fighting the Mexican War. Sometime after his abandonment of the fight he encounters a patrol of soldiers and asks if the war is still going. So much time has passed that the patrol’s officer isn’t sure which war he means. “The war against the president of Mexico,” Jeremiah clarifies. “It’s over!” comes the response. So then Jeremiah asks, his tone of voice perfectly calibrated to convey a mix of mild curiosity and ultimate indifference: “Who won?” —CB One of the great Upper East Side movies, Paul Mazursky’s feminist romantic dramedy “An Unmarried Woman” is also one of the most emotionally intelligent American movies of the 1970s: The story of Erica Benton (Jill Clayburgh), who must come to terms with her husband (Michael Murphy) leaving her for another, what-else-but much younger woman, and set out on the healing and hopeful path to reclaiming herself later in life. (While Clayburgh was in her mid-30s when Mazursky shot the movie, something about her feels older, wiser.) But “An Unmarried Woman” is also a sharp feminist text and richly lived-in-feeling portrait of New York City life. Clayburgh’s superb performance, which was Best Actress-nominated at the 1979 Academy Awards after winning that prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, has a deft and deceptive lightness that gives Erica a sort of floating-through-life, almost gossamer quality that makes her at times tricky to read (and so therefore more fascinating to watch). It’s also extremely cathartic for the audience. Though Erica, an art dealer, eventually gets acquainted with Alan Bates as an abstract painter, “An Unmarried Woman” isn’t a romantic comedy in search of a match for its leading character. It’s a more naturalistic, minor-key character study that feels closer in spirit to an indie, landing on a great punchline of an ending as Erica trudges with a giant oversized painting in her arms down the streets of SoHo, a painting given to her by Bates’ artist. That Erica refuses to settle for an alternate relationship is what makes the empowering “An Unmarried Woman” so remarkable and even groundbreaking today. But just imagine that take in the 1970s, barely a few years into Women’s Liberation. —RL In the cinema of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, “The body keeps the score” is as true of the Earth itself as any human who trods upon it. Wielding a style of punishing austerity achieved through meticulous composition, movement, and editing, the filmmakers arrived at a singular meeting point between the classicism of John Ford and Charlie Chaplin and the avant-garde modernism of Robert Bresson and Bertolt Brecht. “From the Clouds to the Resistance” is one of the finest displays of their oeuvre, a testament to human struggle against oppressors ranging from ancient Greco-Roman myths of defying the gods all the way up to the antifascist resistances of the 1940s. Beneath its deliberately anti-dramatic surface of long takes and unemotional delivery of declamatory dialogue, the film communicates with lyrical beauty. Tree branches are used as proscenia to theatrically encase actors, and eyeline matches subtly establish power dynamics between their characters. Small fluctuations in natural light hint at shifts in those dynamics as one person or another asserts will against the other, and multi-planar compositions of landscape evoke painters like Cézanne while also silently testifying to the incalculable gallons of blood spilled on hills and dales over the course of human history and its endless wars. And for all the filmmakers’ Brechtian distance, they ultimately present a deeply human thesis of the capacity to endure and oppose even the harshest regimes of control. —JC Politically incisive director Lindsay Anderson found in Malcolm McDowell a wide-eyed and peculiar vessel to examine the economic inequities and ideologically corrosive nature of post-war British capitalism. Here, in the picaresque second film of their Mick Travis trilogy, McDowell embodies the perpetually cheerful lad as a coffee seller whose ambition and disposition earns him a rare upward mobility. As Mick travels across the U.K.’s northeast selling his unethically sourced product, his quick ascent and eventual downfall is interspersed with Alan Price’s musical performances. With lyrics like “Sell everything you stand for” or “Someone’s got to win in the human race/ If it isn’t you, then it has to be me,” the tracks are far from conspicuous, but their inclusion lends a cheeky undertone to a film that’s brimming with latent darkness. Anderson and screenwriter David Sherwin insert Travis’ evolution from idealism to disillusionment into the larger context of the Britain’s blood-soaked imperial past and its enduring consequences. As Travis becomes aware he’s just a disposable pawn, susceptible and perhaps even powerless to the whims of a system designed to chew him up and spit him out, McDowell’s expression turns from curious to utterly defeated. The character’s “luck” has ultimately run out. —CA Chris Marker’s three-hour ciné-essay takes a look over the preceding decade of global leftist movements and their various failures, from the student protests across the west to pushes in Soviet states for greater autonomy from Moscow. It is the latter that often proves the most compelling material for how little it has been covered in the west; in one of the film’s most transfixing sequences, Marker plays footage of Fidel Castro publicly declaring support for the Soviet Union’s invasion of Czechoslovakia to repress protests, lingering on the Cuban leader’s ambiguous expression for hints of self-awareness at betraying the higher ideals of revolution for self-determination. Marker’s pioneering form of half-studious, half-associative history has arguably become more relevant in recent years than it ever was during his lifetime, a clear forerunner to an entire genre of video content devoted to obsessive exegeses of politics and pop culture. Adam Curtis in particular is inconceivable without this film, but Marker’s overriding sense of play avoids the pitfalls of conspiratorial frenzy that besets so many of his successors. —JC Lino Brocka’s 1975 genre-bending fable is so dexterous an affair that you’d be forgiven for accidentally underselling it. It is a queer melodrama, a sociological survey of Marcos-era Filipino life, and a rollicking mystery. Without ever dulling the film’s gritty, anti-colonialist messaging, “Manila in the Claws of Light” remains prime entertainment. It feels miraculous that the film even exists in the first place — that Brocka did this, in front of a camera, with this many people, that it looks this good, and that it released to international success. Yet none of the aforementioned qualities are what lingers most vividly between individual viewings. The most striking aspect of the film is the infrastructure: The dirt piles next to a construction site, the market stalls built from sheet metal, the hand-painted menus at a restaurant. Brocka’s camera focuses so intently on these spaces because of he cares so passionately for the people whose spirit threaten to be crushed by merely inhabiting them. When I think about “Manila in the Claws of Light,” this is what first comes to mind. —SB In 1973, the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney decided to adapt a 19th century book about the feminist history of witchcraft into an animated prog-rock musical about a medieval peasant girl who gets gang-raped on her wedding night and then turns to Satan for help with her revenge. This is really a thing that happened. See it even once and you’ll never forget that it did. Strange even by the psychedelic standards of its time, Eiichi Yamamoto’s wild and exhausting “Belladonna of Sadness” is a sinister anime fairytale inspired by the same fetish for medievalism that gripped Jacques Demy and Pier Paolo Pasolini, layered in recursive prog-rock jams, and filled with enough vaginal imagery to make Georgia O’Keeffe blush. From that imagery erupts the film’s vivid approach to sexual violence, as the heroine’s assault is symbolized by the sight of her naked body being cleaved in two down the middle like a butchered animal carcass, blood flying out of wound in the form of bats that flap off into oblivion. Few movies have ever so viscerally depicted the psychic toll of such trauma — the crime’s power to tear a person apart from themselves. Smarter than it is salacious, the film’s narrative complements its Eurocentric art style, further distancing “Belladonna of Sadness” from the world of hentai and locating it instead in a Western history where women are positioned as angels of liberty, and witchcraft their way of rebelling against institutional misogyny. History has a habit of prizing women for their sexuality one minute and punishing them for it the next, and Yamamoto’s film reflects that dynamic down to its core. This is a story about men who are in the thrall of a woman’s beauty, and then enraged by their inability to control it. It continues to prove moving, even in its (budget-enforced) stillness. —DE A tumbleweed-like tour across a broken country that’s trying to get back on its feet as the horrors of the Vietnam War come to a close, Jerry Schatzberg’s painfully unforgiving “Scarecrow” is a story about two drifters who give each other a sense of direction even though neither of them has anywhere left to go. Max Millan (Gene Hackman) is a short-tempered ex-con who looks askance at everyone he meets. Frances Lionel “Lion” Delbuchi (Al Pacino) is a stunted and guileless former sailor who dreams of reconnecting with his ex in Pittsburgh — and of becoming a father to the child he’s never met. These odd vagabonds make for a strained and unlikely pair of friends, but Lion’s puppy dog naivete turns out to be the perfect counterweight to Max’s cynicism, and it isn’t long before these two men are supporting each other in a way that no one else ever has. Shadowed by a deep and implacable darkness from the moment it starts, “Scarecrow” endures — and even offers its own strange kind of comfort — because of the lightning-in-a-bottle frisson it captures between its lead characters, whose tetchy dynamic was reflected in the conflicting styles of the actors who played them. Hackman’s introspective reserve clashed with Pacino’s method immersion, and though both actors were at the height of their powers, it took all of their combined talent to make it through a scene without snapping. That barely contained explosiveness lends an extra poignancy to the strength that Max and Lion give to and take from each other; it builds and builds until the point where their friendship starts to seem like it could point towards true north in a world that’s lost its moral compass. Alas, it leads them somewhere else in the end, as “Scarecrow” resolves as an indelibly American reminder that moving forward isn’t as simple as finding a way to get there. —DE Robert Bresson shook up his image as an imposing, aesthetically spartan moralist “Four Nights of a Dreamer,” which unmoors his usually materialist cinema into the realm of fantasia. Inspired by Dostoevsky’s short story, “White Nights,” the film follows the relationship that forms between a suicidal young woman and the stranger who attempts to convince her to live. Bresson retains his economy of storytelling to capture the caution with which both people open up to each other, but elsewhere he indulges in the most delicate and effervescent camera work of his career. At times, the film verges on comedy, if not outright self-parody. In a brief film-within-the-film moment, Bresson renders the bare plot as a quasi-thriller as if to show he could make more traditionally crowd-pleasing fare if he wished, and he reworks the ending of the source story as a bleakly funny punchline on the smitten protagonist’s presumption of possible romance with his rescued damsel. And yet, the underlying interest of Bresson’s filmography — the elusive search for truth in any of its forms — is as present here as his more feted works. For Bresson, the “meet-cute” becomes a means of unpacking the entire spiritual possibilities of love. —JC When talking about ‘70s culture, words like “paranoid” and “anti-establishment” loom so heavily in the air that it’s easy to lose sight of their meaning and use them exclusively as aesthetic descriptors. But even after 50 years, a film like “Dog Day Afternoon” makes it impossible to reduce the social unrest it depicts to grooming choices and editing styles. No amount of philosophizing disgrace and criticizing fears could convince a viewer that the society Sydney Lumet depicts isn’t on the brink of collapse — or, at the very least, isn’t convinced of its own imminent downfall. Even by the comparably low standards of the antihero-loving ‘70s, Sonny Worzik is not the kind of hero that a healthy civilization turns its eyes to in times of need. A chaos agent with all the poise of a chainsaw juggler in their first day on the job, his impulsive bank robbery devolves into a hostage situation in the blink of an eye. Fueled by little more than a deep belief that nobody’s promises are worth the paper they’re printed on, his make-things-up-as-he-goes approach to negotiation is the work of a man who feels so utterly invisible that he’ll settle for making enough noise to be noticed. On a technical narrative level, “Dog Day Afternoon” is as gripping a thriller as they come. As a social artifact, it’s one of the definitive examples of the chaos that was seeping into every crack of the American consciousness. Sonny only gains momentum from his admirers as he invokes the Attica prison riots, cultivating the crowd’s anger into a collective demand to see someone, anyone, do something to upset the powers that be. It’s all futile, as there’s only one way that a movie like this can end, but few films have ever reflected that futility with so much fire. —CZ Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” was only the British director’s second feature after 1970’s “Performance” heralded him as an independent moviemaker to watch — and one with a special predilection for unique cross-cutting that felt like a fascinating new riff on the French New Wave. With one of the decade’s most indelible prologues, his film thrusts us into the arid wilds of the Australian Outback, where two English schoolchildren (played by Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg, the director’s son) are unceremoniously dumped by their depressed father after he tries to kill them, and only ends up killing himself. At the same time, their paths as they try to survive in the desert collide with a Black Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, who went on to have a huge film career of his own after this breakout debut) who is on the rite-of-passage journey of which the title gets its name. Still streaked by Roeg’s nihilistic worldview despite the potentially heartwarming center, the unsentimental and briskly told “Walkabout” is also a brutal and unsparing portrait of survival in the wilderness. And speaking of cross-cutting, it’s perhaps most famous for a scene in which Agutter is seen swimming naked, juxtaposed against Gulpilil mercilessly hunting down Outback wildlife. “Walkabout” is a movie all about juxtapositions — man vs. nature, the modern vs. the ancient, the landscape vs. the colonial human forces cutting into and against it. But the tenuous bond that forms between the siblings and the boy, who doesn’t speak a lick of the English language, suggests in cinematic terms how those opposing forces ultimately could (and should) coexist. —RL Akio Jissoji careened from the populist Japanese TV of “Ultraman” to the heights of the nation’s avant-garde with this, the first of a trio of films inspired by Buddhist philosophy. Setting up a morality play in which a monastery attempts to intervene in a local case of youthful sexual indiscretion prove disastrous, the film pivots almost instantly into an abstract self-examination of human contradictions that mingles Middle Path precepts with Marxist dialectics. Not unlike the films of John Cassavetes, “This Transient Life” uses manic theatricality as a means of unpacking subtle emotional complexity, finding grounded and relatable foibles in garish extremes. Throughout, Jissoji puts his camera everywhere except where you’d expect it to be, capturing the drama in de-centered, wide-angled frames that only exacerbate the feeling of the characters being distorted and magnified for study. Rarely has the notion of characters being put under a microscope felt more literally true. —JC Barbet Schroeder’s remarkable documentary was billed as a “self-portrait” for good reason. Uganda’s brutally despotic then-president, Idi Amin, agreed to be filmed on his own terms, confident in how he wanted to be seen. Schroeder let him perform for the camera with minimal intervention, which represented a seismic directorial choice unto itself. “General Idi Amin Dada: A Self-Portrait” doesn’t analyze Amin’s power — it lets us see how power presents itself. What results is both document and spectacle: a record of one man’s delusion, and a warning about how easily image can replace truth. Nearly 50 years later, it still disturbs by showing what happens when control of the camera becomes part of the performance. —TO Akira Kurosawa was so disheartened by the failure of 1970’s Gorky-esque “Dodes’ka-den” that he tried taking his own life. Despite surviving the attempt, Kurosawa was still resigned to the fact that he was unlikely to receive funding ever again. So when the 63-year-old auteur was approached by the Soviet film studio Mosfilm to spend almost two years in the taiga adapting Vladimir Arsenyev’s epic novel “Dersu Uzala” (a book that he had supposedly been fascinated by since the earliest days of his career), Kurosawa wasn’t exactly in a position to say no. The resulting film turned a profit, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and allowed the “Seven Samurai” director to keep working for another 18 years — a period that saw the creation of the late-career masterpieces “Kagemusha” and “Ran.” But here’s the thing: “Dersu Uzala” is as great as those films — as raw and ravishing as anything Kurosawa ever made. Nature had always played an ambient role in his films, but here, in the story of a czarist expedition to the extremes of Russia’s Far East in the early 20th century, it would become the director’s primary subject. The heart of the story is the growing friendship between the leader of the expedition and a Goldi (or Nanai) hunter named Dersu Uzala who serves as their guide. A number of set pieces stand out, most of all the wildfire that consumes a wheat field, which is given extra dimension by the faded otherworldliness of SovColor — Kurosawa would later pay more explicit tribute to Van Gogh in “Dreams,” but this is the movie of his that most resembles one of the Dutch master’s paintings. A committed leftist his whole life, Kurosawa also found in this story one of cinema’s most profound explorations of colonialism and the impossibility of indigenous people continuing their way of life untrammeled by imperial forces. The animist Goldi believe that nothing can truly be owned, that everything living has a spirit, whereas the Russian forces maintain that everything can quantified and acquired. The tragedy sparked from those two conflicting perspectives is every bit as haunting today as it was 50 years ago. —CB The ‘70s were the decade when cinema was formally established as a field worthy of academic study, and one of the things that was regularly discussed in university film classes was the attempt at finding “a new language for film.” Traditionalist Luchino Visconti was in pursuit of the same with his adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” which sees newly widowed Mahler stand-in Gustav von Aschenbach journey to the Lido for “absolute rest.” As Dirk Bogarde’s ailing composer silently takes in the sights on his Italian vacation, Visconti delivers a portrait of subjectivity as potent as “Rear Window,” and with similarly radical sound design. Dialogue seamlessly overlaps with ambient noise as Gustav quietly observes the world against his ever-diminishing place in it, but that languid sense of despair is soon interrupted by the sight of Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), a beautiful Polish teenager who becomes Gustav’s all-consuming obsession. Is Gustav’s fixation predatory, or is it simply that the boy personifies the lost possibilities of the older man’s life? Something to puzzle over. Until that central relationship is established (for his part, Tadzio barely notices the existence of Gustav at all), “Death in Venice” is comfortable to exist in the liminal space between the gorgeousness of its setting and the dread of its protagonist’s anxiety. It’s filmmaking to get lost in, and the ultimate apotheosis of Italian cinema’s inward shift away from Fellini-esque expressionism. Taken in the context of Visconti’s filmography, “Death in Venice” feels like a radical departure from the operatic eruptions of “Rocco and His Brothers.” It’s a film where slight glances, whispered introductions, and the silent offer of an outstretched hand are rich enough to signify the world entire. —CB Made fearlessly just a few years after the 1968 student protests in Mexico City, which resulted in numerous deaths at the hands of the government, Felipe Cazals’ searing indictment of how propaganda can incite a herd mentality — and result in deadly violence — remains as potent as it was when first released. The pioneering filmmaker structured his defiant narrative partially as a fake documentary featuring interviews with actors playing residents of the small rural town of San Miguel Canoa. Their accounts often clash with what we learn happened one night after the malevolent local priest, played with chilling nonchalance by Enrique Lucero, convinces the impoverished residents that a group of young men forced to stay the night in town due to torrential rain are students who’ve arrived to threaten their faith. Without proof of these claims other than the word from the man of the cloth (who operates with ulterior motives), the virulent mob unleash brutality on the visitors — who are in fact university workers, and not pupils. A cautionary tale about the perils of pervasive repression, “Canoa” endures as one of the darkest and most knowing films of its kind. —CA The complaint that they don’t make movies like they used to is as cliched as it is eternal, but watching “The Heartbreak Kid” in 2025 is a quick way to remind yourself how true it really is. The existence of a major studio release centered around a reprehensible man who starts an affair on his honeymoon — and then proceeds to meander through a slow-paced journey in which he learns nothing before the movie fizzles out with a whimper — would be unthinkable in any era except the New Hollywood of the 1970s. And yet, anyone lucky enough to track down a copy of this semi-lost classic can attest that it still holds up as one of the driest, funniest movies of the 20th century. Charles Grodin’s Lenny Cantrow is a man without a single redeeming quality, a smarmy sporting goods salesman who radiates so much selfishness that every institution holding polite society together seemingly dissolves in his presence. To be fair, nobody around him is that great either. His first wife Lila (Jeannie Berlin) is hopelessly naive and needy, falling for Lenny’s tricks for far longer than she should, even if their relationship barely lasts a week. And his second target, Cybill Shepherd’s Kelly Corcoran (because of course, a girl like that would have a name like Kelly Corcoran), is all too happy to let a newlywed man pursue her, seemingly only for the fleeting pleasure of the attention he provides. The only character with any redeeming qualities is her overbearing father who forbids her from dating Lenny. He’s the kind of cheap stock character who normally serves as an antagonist to be defeated in most romances, but the only person thinking clearly in this sick sad world, which should tell you everything you need to know about the morality we’re dealing with here.The all-star pairing of writer Neil Simon and director Elaine May renders the story with an appropriately unsympathetic gaze. Lenny barrels through the world spewing self-serving bullshit as he chases shiny object after shiny object, hurting everyone in his path who falls for it and leaving the few outsiders who see through him to shake their heads in disgust. “The Heartbreak Kid” is often labeled a satire of marriage, but that’s only a half-truth. May and Simon take a neutral stance on the practice itself, but make it clear that some of us are far too narcissistic to deserve it. And the film’s brilliantly abrupt ending illustrates that there’s no other institution that could successfully take its place, because the real problems lie within us, not the cauliflower. —CZ It’s hard to argue that Lau Kar Leung’s “Heroes of the East” is the best of the Shaw Brothers classics that came out of Hong Kong during the 1970s, as the decade’s — and the century’s — quintessential martial-arts studio simply produced too many immortal beat-em-ups for there to be a definitive standout. Nevertheless, this ultra-kinetic relationship comedy about the arranged marriage between a rich Chinese kung fu student (the great Gordon Liu as Ho Tao) and a deceptively meek Japanese woman (Yuka Mizuno as Yumiko) serves as the perfect stand-in for an entire golden age on a list like this one. Not only does “Heroes of the East” highlight a wide, wide variety of the fighting styles that were showcased across the Shaw Brothers’ filmography, and not only does it provide the most dynamic showcase for one of the studio’s greatest stars, but it also epitomizes how fluently these movies bent combat into a hyper-eloquent form of communication unto itself. In this case, that communication expresses a fierce cross-cultural rivalry between Chinese and Japanese styles — comedically at first, and then with growing intensity as a legion of masters from the land of the rising sun travel to Shanghai to prove that Ho Tao is unworthy of Yumiko’s hand. Scored by a symphony of chop! pow! sound effects, each duel is a discrete masterpiece of old school kung-fu choreography, and they build on one another in a way that turns the entire second half of the movie into an extended crescendo of balletic ass-kicking, the grand finale of which is made all the more satisfying by the respect Lau pays to both of the countries involved. —DE Ousmane Sembène’s “Ceddo” offers a vivid and exceptionally complex look at the nascent days of Senegal’s European colonization, but the actual time period covered by the events of the film is never firmly established. “I can’t give a date,” Sembène said when presented the question. “These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century, and are still occurring.” A Wolof-speaking people face a crossroads: Their king wants to ally with the Islamic forces that have been exerting a growing influence on their country, which would later become the modern-day nation of Senegal. The “Ceddo,” outsiders who refuse to be colonized by either Muslims or Christians, kidnap the king’s daughter as ransom to ensure that he turns away from Islam. Violence ensues. Western cinema is prone to stories of privileged male characters being marooned with their enemies, only to find shared values and common cause along the way. With history on its side, “Ceddo” inverts that hero’s journey, as it’s the king’s daughter Dior (Tabata Ndiaye) who finds a new perspective among the outsiders and ultimately fights against her father — a painful but rousing struggle that highlights the eternal war against cultural usurpation, and the crucial role that women must be allowed to play in that fight. —CB A soft but sexually charged drama against the stunning alpine backdrop of Lake Annecy over the course of a summer month, Éric Rohmer’s “Claire’s Knee” initially resembles what a hater of French arthouse cinema probably thinks all of the nation’s films are about. Its story tells of a middle-aged man named Jérôme (Jean-Claude Brialy) whose recent engagement has done nothing to slow his lust for other women. He develops a romantic interest in two underage girls as part of what can only be described an esoteric wager he makes while discussing sex and monogamy with a novelist friend (Aurora Cornu). When he learns that the younger of the two girls is in love with him, he makes a move on her out of recreation as much as anything else, only to be shot down because she doesn’t believe he truly loves her. He then turns his attention to her step-sister, forming an obsession with her knee that consumes his thoughts. But no plot summaries could ever hope to do the film justice, as “Claire’s Knee” has less to do with any individual human relationship than our remarkable ability to rationalize our desires and misdeeds. Jérôme never gets a chance to consummate his lust for Claire — nor, it could be argued, does he really want to. Instead, Rohmer masterfully illustrates the way possession and attainability (or the lack thereof) are inextricably tied to our desires. Every interaction is so profoundly overanalyzed and overcomplicated that it’s a miracle anyone has any fun at all on this miserable trip. The real lesson might be that when there’s a void of activity on a summer vacation, humans will naturally move to fill it. The lewd premise builds to the most chaste of climaxes, with Jérôme talking himself into being content with an utterly mundane (if sinisterly motivated) interaction. Because, despite all of its stunning scenery, “Claire’s Knee” is a film that takes place entirely inside its characters’ minds, with the mental gymnastics they perform to assign meaning to all of their endeavors taking precedence over the endeavors themselves. It’s one of the finest examples of Rohmer’s brand of cinema about destructively intellectual characters, and stands alongside “My Night at Maud’s” as one of his finest “Moral Tales.” —CZ Rainer Werner Fassbinder left behind a body of work that struck a precarious yet remarkably sturdy balance of experimental theater, postwar radicalism, and classical Hollywood melodrama, and “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” is one of the great showcases of his malleability. Reworking the age-gap romantic yearning of Douglas Sirk’s “All That Heaven Allows” around the additional complication of race, Fassbinder brings together lonely, widowed empty-nester Emmi (Brigitte Mira) and hale young Moroccan immigrant Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) as an unlikely couple who rapidly developing affection faces constant tests from disapproving friends, relatives, and sneering passers-by. Fassbinder filters Sirk’s florid, intimate approach to melodrama through his own eerily pristine, at times ironically detached style. He frequently lenses in long shots that convey not the emotions between the couple but the icy, judgmental stares of others who watch them with revulsion. The film also highlights the way in which even the most obviously disapproving people will still put on a facade of cordiality that only makes their disdain sharper. There are also reminders of Germany’s grim recent history, as when Emmi takes Ali to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their elopement and reflexively boasts “Hitler used to eat here!” As both she and Ali feel the pressure from their loved ones to end their relationship, the emotions held at arm’s length eventually explode, leading to perhaps the most visceral ending of Fassbinder’s vast canon. —JC An obstinate seeker who hadn’t been able to finish any of the films he’d started, Errol Morris was on the verge of turning 30 when he stumbled upon a San Francisco Chronicle headline that read: “450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY.” Armed with new resolve, he gathered money from friends and family to closely investigate the story in the spring and summer of 1977. His friend, Werner Herzog, famously pledged to eat a shoe if the film was ever finished and exhibited. Though it technically explores pet cemeteries, “Gates of Heaven” isn’t much considered with its ostensible raison d’être. Morris uses pets, death, and small businesses as a lens to consider people’s voices: the manner in which they speak, the narratives they construct about themselves, the yarns they spin. The young director bent cinema vérité to his will by eschewing the de rigueur handheld style of the era in favor of a static camera and direct address. Morris’s locked-off medium shots not only called attention to his highly composed framing, but they also had the hypnotic effect of drawing audiences closer to his subjects as they wax (or drawl) poetic (or comical) about everything under the sun. When Morris screened “Gates of Heaven” for his idol Douglas Sirk at the Berlin Film Festival, he walked out halfway through, calling the film a slideshow. It’s easy to see how he arrived at such a conclusion, and, possibly heeding the filmmaker’s criticism, Morris would never deploy such stillness again in his career. But only the most stubbornly dogmatic viewer could ignore the cinematic spirit animating the director’s photographic compositions. Sirk also cautioned Morris about his film’s supposedly ironic pose, a humorous note considering how frequently the master of melodrama utilized irony in his own work. While Morris certainly mines comedy from his subjects’s eccentricities or quirks of speech, anyone who believes that he made “Gates of Heaven” as an exercise in mockery simply isn’t paying attention. Morris’s permissive interviewing strategy, which entails getting his subjects to speak for as long as possible without much intervention, doesn’t merely facilitate open communication. It’s also a sign of unencumbered respect for their worldviews. Take, for example, Florence Rasmussen, an elderly woman who lives across the street from one of the two pet cemeteries the film examines. She delivers an uninterrupted five-minute monologue about her life while sitting in her front doorway. Circuitous and contradictory, and gloriously “off topic,” her speech exemplifies Morris’s attentive approach: if you just let people talk, they’ll reveal the world. —VM A father has raised his children without contact with the outside world, and their lifelong isolation has warped their understanding of social norms. Yet the older they get, the more they question what’s beyond the walls that ostensibly cage them for their protection. The description may call to mind Yorgos Lanthimos’ Oscar-nominated “Dogtooth,” but it refers instead to “The Castle of Purity,” the breakthrough film by unsung Mexican master Arturo Ripstein. Inspired by a shocking case that came to light in 1950s Mexico City, the unflinching drama chronicles how Gabriel (Claudio Brook), a disturbed patriarch, walks the streets finding buyers for the rat poison that his wife and kids produce in their large home. He rules with the firm hand of an authoritarian at home, and though he forbids his family from eating meat or indulging in worldly vices, he doesn’t preach by example. Ripstein, who immediately recognized the inspiration that “Dogtooth” took from his film, is an artist recurrently interested in religious hypocrisy and the most sordid alcoves of the human mind; here, he depicts the abuse Gabriel inflicts on his household with sobering rigor, resolving in an unforgettable study of how evil has always found domesticity to be among its most convincing disguises. —CA A 15-year-old moppet named Mike (John Moulder-Brown) drops out of school and lands a gig at an East London public bath at the tail end of the swingin’ ’60s, where he’s preyed upon by the sexually underserved female clientele at the same time as he begins obsessing over his seasoned and inscrutable co-worker Susan (Jane Asher, fresh off a relationship with Paul McCartney). It’s Mike’s first job, and he doesn’t know that they’re not all like this. Plunged into a seedy but spectacular world that’s brimming with desire and steeped in confusion, Mike is soon at the mercy of his own lust for life — a lust that fixates upon Susan, and rages at all the reasons why she can’t belong to him. One of the only color movies that David Lynch ever loved, Jerzy Skolomowski’s darkly fun “Deep End” is as hyper-vivid in its production design as it is in its hormonal distress. Here is a film that sees coming of age as a delirium thick enough to drown in, as its naive protagonist — a virginal need monster who sees older men take what they want from the young women around them, and is too horny to recognize that they’re stealing — tries his best to stay afloat in the turbulent waters between free love and possessive ownership. Skolomowski’s almost psychedelic approach to psychosexual mania creates an unbroken dreamstate where nothing feels real but everything is. Where the world begs to be touched even as it remains just out of reach. Where Susan is both an inanimate crush object and a richly humanized character who’s already had to pay too high a price for her sexual currency (a dynamic that’s indelibly realized in the sequence where Mike steals a life-sized nude cut-out of a woman who looks just like Susan, and proceeds to project all of his desire onto it over the course of a long dark night). All the more true to life for its expressionistic flourishes, and for an ending that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a fable, “Deep End” announced the full possibilities of ’70s cinema with a fatal bang. —DE Widely acknowledged as the first home-grown Jamaican film to be shot with an entirely Jamaican cast and crew, Perry Henzell’s “The Harder They Come” is a shaggy-dog thriller that also happens to be a form-breaking smash (as radical as “Breathless” in its own right), and “the film that brought reggae to the world.” That’s the thing: Maybe you’ve never watched “The Harder They Come,” but you’ve absolutely heard multiple songs from its smash-hit soundtrack album. Many of them are by the film’s star Jimmy Cliff, but the tunes also include all-time bangers like “Draw Your Brakes” by Scotty and “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop” by Toots & the Maytals. Take a look at the movie, though: Cliff stars as a wayward youth, Ivanhoe “Ivan” Martin, who grew up in the countryside but tries to make it big in the Kingston recording industry. Crossing paths with gangsters and a shady record mogul who only wants to pay him a one-and-done $20 for recording the title track, Ivan becomes a trigger-happy outlaw unwilling to play by society’s rules. It starts naturalistically enough, so much so that if you just flipped to it on TV you might think it’s a documentary at first. By the end, however, Henzell’s film actually plays more like late ‘60s Godard than “Breathless,” with scenes of militarized police pursuing Ivan on gorgeous beaches while meta touches — including the interspersed use of Sergio Corbucci’s “Django” — break down why we’re all so besotted by outlaw mystique in the first place. Even if the music gets more of the attention, the film itself is every bit as intoxicating. If there’s the cinematic equivalent of an ear-worm, this is it. —CB Long before indie cinema as we know it found its footing in the ’90s, Claudia Weill’s “Girlfriends” delivered a groundbreaking look at female friendship, ambition, and loneliness — all through the lens of one woman’s coming-of-age in New York City. Shot on a shoestring budget (and one that almost didn’t cut it), but with razor-sharp emotional clarity, “Girlfriends” is a landmark of American independent filmmaking and one of the most criminally overlooked gems of the 1970s. Well, overlooked no more. At a time when studio films rarely centered the interior lives of women, “Girlfriends” dared to tell a story about the complexities of female independence. Melanie Mayron stars as Susan, a struggling photographer navigating career uncertainty and emotional isolation after her best friend (played by Anita Skinner) abruptly gets married and moves out. What follows is a radical exploration of solitude, creative frustration, and the shifting dynamics of female friendship. Think of it this way, can you name another film that both Stanley Kubrick and Greta Gerwig have praised? Weill’s direction captures small moments with a documentary-like intimacy that feels years ahead of its time. There’s no melodrama here — just the authentic messiness of life in your twenties, portrayed with empathy and humor. It’s a film that doesn’t just pass the Bechdel Test — it practically wrote it. In an era dominated by antiheroes and epics, “Girlfriends” carved out something smaller, more personal — and in doing so, became one of the most enduring and influential films of the decade. —KE Hayao Miyazaki is most famous for making personal, original, idiosyncratic films about his favored themes: nature, environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, youth, and aging. But for his feature debut, when Ghibli was just a glimmer in his eye, he made pure franchise popcorn entertainment. And the result is a complete blast. “The Castle of Cagliostro” is a stand-alone entry in the “Lupin III” series, an iconic manga and anime franchise about the descendant of legendary gentleman thief Arsene Lupin, as he travels the world with his criminal gang taking on heists and outfoxing the determined Interpol agent Zenigata. In “Castle of Cagliostro,” his heist isn’t to steal money or gold, but a person: Princess Clarisse, who is being forced to marry the titular Cagliostro, a monstrous greedy count. It’s a perfect setup for some fun, and “Castle of Cagliostro” is fun above all else, a total action-adventure blast with setpieces like the car chase and the often-imitated clock-tower fight that rank among the most thrilling moments in the anime film canon. Miyazaki’s confidence and skill as director from the jump is a sight to behold. —WC “The Devils” is a blasphemous film, although the hysterical profanity and nuns lasciviously tonguing Christ’s side wound aren’t what’s truly heretical about it. Instead, director Ken Russell’s most vicious critiques of the Catholic Church appear in the small moments of spiritual repose playboy priest Father Grandier (Oliver Reed) finds with a woman he meets through the church. The Holy See’s perverse lust for power means that it would rather torture and kill innocent people than allow them to find God through each other. That’s what Russell’s condemning here. The rest is all set dressing — set dressing provocative enough that Warner Bros. has done its best to suppress the film for the past 50 years, but still. —KR What is left to say about a film like “Klute?” Alan J. Pakula’s call girl noir has had, at one point or another, every element of its craft rightly celebrated by critics in the 54 years since its initial release. The textures of the film — the score, the outfits, the light fixtures and how Gordon Willis painted with them — prove the aesthetic zenith of a bygone era in American cinema. In a genre where individuals are often merely synecdoche for institutional machinations, the romance between Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland is disarmingly grounded. Fonda’s Bree Daniel is an idol of feminist cinema, and the film’s radically non-judgmental view of sex work remains admirable. In a world so obsessed with the contradiction of cinematic voyeurism and the symbolic martyrdom of rough women, Pakula pursues different questions with better answers. “Klute” examines the sensuality of autonomy, the messiness of adult intimacy, and whether acting in direct defiance of harms suffered can ever offer real solace, or instead further trap someone within their trauma. All of this is well-worn territory, but none of that matters when you sit down to watch the movie — even now, more than 50 years since “Klute” was first released, its allure proves totally singular. —SB Meiko Kaji was already bored with playing stoic badasses by the time she was approached for the title role in Toshiya Fujita’s adaptation of Kazuo Koike’s manga series. But she liked the director and the script, so she took the job. And thank goodness she did, because Kaji’s Yuki, an assassin trained from birth to avenge her family’s deaths, is one of the most iconic action heroines in all of cinema. Her graceful movements and intense stare are practically supernatural, an effect that’s enhanced by the striking production design and stylized carnage. You might think you’ve seen the color red, but you really haven’t — not until you’ve seen “Lady Snowblood.” —KR “Why would you choose someone who loves you too little over someone who loves you too much?” Charles (John Heard) asks his lover Laura (Mary Beth Hurt) as they’re tearfully breaking up. “Because it makes me feel less of a fraud,” she curtly responds. A toxically-romantic comedy adapted from Ann Beattie’s 1976 novel, Joan Micklin Silver’s “Chilly Scenes of Winter” chronicles a doomed affair between two aimless thirtysomethings in snowy Salt Lake City. Charles pines for Laura in between wasting away at his bullshit government job and dealing with his mentally unstable mother (Gloria Grahame), but he does so to such an narcissistic, self-destructive degree that his behavior would raise significant red flags in our current social climate. Part of the greatness of “Chilly Scenes of Winter” lies in Silver’s abject refusal to condemn Charles’s obsession with Laura; instead, she empathizes with his passion, even when he’s being pointedly unlikable or downright cruel. Heard’s holistic performance treats the romantic and spiteful streaks in Charles’s character as if they emanate from the same confused source rather than two sides of a split personality. His love is as genuine as Laura’s ambivalence, which extends in just about every direction —towards Charles and her failing marriage to her dull husband, but mostly towards herself. Silver’s sincere respect for the sheer realism of her characters—their messy personalities, the fundamentally tenebrous nature of their relationship, their asymmetrical love for each other—has no parallel in the domestic drama. Yet, it’s Silver’s choice to situate Charles and Laura’s mutual anguish within, as opposed to outside, life’s myriad headaches that elevates their relationship to unexpected cinematic heights. Overfamiliar bosses and lovesick secretaries, familial burdens and friendly obligations, the humdrum routine of going to work and feeding oneself in winter intrude upon Charles’s heartache. Neither his lovelorn desires nor Laura’s guilt can take priority over everything else in their respective worlds because there’s simply too many unsexy adult responsibilities to manage, until eventually the yearning becomes another chore. Silver acutely understands that casual tragedy of Charles and Laura broken relationship is that life didn’t stop for them. It just goes on and on until the pain becomes a distant memory. —VM In her dismissive review of “Seven Beauties,” Pauline Kael wrote that Lina Wertmüller “keeps her films moving by hurling salamis at the audience.” And maybe that’s true — after all, this withering dark comedy includes the most jarring close-up of a penis in the history of Holocaust cinema — but not in the way that Kael meant it. By 1975, the movies were already starving for new ways to visualize the greatest atrocity of the 20th century, which three decades of post-war cinema had already ossified into a dead language of digestible images. Wertmüller had to feed the people something. In that sense, her magnum opus is one hell of a meal. A larger-than-life Giancarlo Giannini stars as Pasqualino “Seven Beauties” Frafuso, Naples’ horniest and most flamboyant hoodlum, and a man whose utter lack of dignity is ultimately his only hope of enduring the depravity of a concentration camp. Combining the picaresque lightness of an old fable with the unfathomable horrors of real life — and using the subversive pleasures of grindhouse cinema to reinvigorate a nightmare the world is always on the brink of forgetting — Wertmüller’s greatest and most grotesque film had the temerity to think of survival as a virtue unto itself. In committing to that idea until the bitter end, “Seven Beauties” was able to prevent the Holocaust from becoming just another genre. Almost 50 years later, it still retains that same power. —DE A philosophical take on the vampire myth, Bill Gunn’s 1973 arthouse horror film features erudite characters, heady eroticism, and complex commentary on African-American ethnic and religious identity, all rendered in 16mm that shimmers in the summer heat. “Night of the Living Dead” actor Duane Jones stars, playing an anthropologist whose research into an obscure cult of African blood-drinkers gains a new dimension after his assistant (Gunn) stabs him with an ancient ceremonial dagger. It’s a startling work of art, one that was nearly lost after bad reviews led its distributor to recut it as an exploitation picture. Gunn’s version was eventually restored, and was remade by Spike Lee as “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” in 2014. —KR Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Stalker” looks and moves unlike anything that came before it. To create one of the most immersive sci-fi worlds ever captured on celluloid, Tarkovsky relied on the neat trick of telling audiences absolutely nothing. We never learn when the film takes place or what country its characters hail from, only that there’s a dangerous place called the Zone where you can come face to face with your truest desires. It’s a harrowing journey to your final destination, which requires those brave enough to visit the Zone to hire tour guides known as “Stalkers.” That’s all we get before the Russian auteur launches us on an unforgettable journey through the contradictions of the human psyche. And it’s a good thing thing he keeps us in the dark so much, because anything else would be overkill.Tarkovsky fills the Zone with a combination of lush greenery and abandoned machinery, creating an undeniable image of humans fighting a losing battle with nature. Everything, from the tour guide’s warnings to the harsh landscape, suggests that mankind doesn’t belong here. That there are some truths lurking in the universe that we simply weren’t meant to know. It all builds to a climax that’s painful to wrap one’s mind around even after multiple viewings: Our truest desires are lurking so deep within us that there’s no guarantee that we know them ourselves. Tarkovsky was hardly the first to suggest that we’re imprisoned by our cravings and urges, but he crystallized their sinister and uncontrollable nature better than any filmmaker before or since. —CZ Martin Scorsese’s fourth feature showcased the director’s love for cinema — and for the actresses who built it — in its first frames. Shot by Marty’s pal Michael Ballhaus, this luminous 1974 drama kicks off with a nearly shot-for-shot homage to Victor Fleming’s “The Wizard of Oz” before opening up onto the world of Alice, played by Ellen Burstyn. Her delivery-driver husband, with whom she and her small son lived in a middle-of-nowhere New Mexico town, is killed on the job, and so they jettison to California in hopes of cobbling together a better life. Burstyn and Alfred Lutter, who plays Alice’ son Tommy, have an easy chemistry; he’s a child who’s been around only adults his whole life and can’t relate to people his own age, forced to fathom the dramas and dealings of those older than him. Alice and Tommy wind up in Arizona, where she takes up a job at a folksy diner in hopes of scrounging up enough change to get all the way to California. Their time in Phoenix surrounds a lovely, leisurely plot where Alice gets into yet another bad relationship. Fabulous minor roles are played by the likes of Diane Ladd as another waitress at the cafe, who has an angry and witty tongue, and Jodie Foster as a tomboy Tommy later meets in Tucson. This and “Mommy Dearest” were the only films screenwriter Robert Getchell was really known for. The gentle lilt and warmth of this kitchen-sink drama — really the last from Scorsese — make for a refreshing entree into the filmmaker’s meaner and more viscerally pungent later work. It’s the rare portrait of an intelligent and funny woman who stands on her own, even as she’s wobbling, in the director’s mostly male-driven filmography. For all the grief he’s gotten because of that slant, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” remains one of the very best things he’s ever made. —RL No one could extract deep meaning from static landscapes like Chantal Akerman, and the “Jeanne Dielman” filmmaker’s juxtaposition of avant-garde structure and raw emotion was never more potent than in “News From Home.” In 1976, Akerman returned to New York City, where she lived for two years while finding her footing as an artist. There, she observed once-familiar settings made distant not only by time, but by the dispassionate lens of her camera. The resulting footage is overlaid with narration reading letters from Akerman’s mother, which are affectionate and chatty but with an undertone of sadness. Combined, they evoke a precise, poignant emotion, the lonely but thrilling sensation of standing on a train platform far from home. —KR It’s bold to make a thriller where the action is predicated on not moving around too much, and even bolder to remake the rare thriller that manages to pull that off (Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “The Wages of Fear”). But in the humid-as-hell “Sorcerer,” William Friedkin’s direction turns the tiniest shifts into the stuff of breathtaking suspense, as two trucks — doubled up to ensure that at least one of them makes the drop-off — packed with highly unstable payloads of nitroglycerin slowly crawl their way through the muddy South American jungle. The roads that lead to these moments are almost as compelling, as Friedkin skillfully introduces the movie’s four criminal protagonists and their reasons for taking this suicidal job. Cynical, sweaty, and set to one of the most transportive film scores ever composed, “Sorcerer” is New Hollywood filmmaking at its finest — even if it took a few decades for Hollywood to realize it. —KR As sublime a full-color epic as has ever been projected onto a movie screen, King Hu’s “A Touch of Zen” was key in introducing the aesthetics and values of Chinese wuxia storytelling to the West. A former Shaw Brothers studio man with an artistic eye and an exacting sense of detail, Hu brought a spiritual dimension to his tales of chivalrous combat that elevated them above their contemporaries. Here, the martial-arts action is secondary: The first real fight scene doesn’t take place until nearly an hour into the picture. But when those scenes do come, they’re nothing short of spectacular — balletic and graceful and edited with an eccentric rhythm that only enhances the magic of skilled performers in motion. —KR Made over an arduous 15 years in which star Meena Kumari’s alcoholism not only regularly derailed filming but ended her marriage to director Kamal Amrohi, “Pakeezah” at last emerged in 1972 as a typically baroque Bollywood melodrama that traces a forbidden romance between a courtesan and her highborn lover down to the next generation of their respective families. Through various twists of fate, the daughter that a wealthy man could not recognize eventually catches the eye of his nephew, repeating a cycle of heartbreak. What separates the film from its peers is the sheer depth of Amrohi’s direction, which often makes up for Kumari’s inconsistent dancing in musical sequences with a heavy use of other performers arrayed in dizzying multi-planar compositions that cross the elaborate blocking of Jacques Tati’s “Playtime” with the most ambitious Indian dance choreography. Rendered in luminous color, “Pakeezah” is like an ornate music box, suspended outside of rationality or even time while conveying an instantly felt emotional directness. —JC Frederick Wiseman’s arc is one of the most important in the history of American documentary film: from a deep skeptic of U.S. institutions, to a fierce defender of them. “Welfare” is one of his greatest achievements because it occupies a kind of middle ground — and points to exactly where America would be headed over the next 50 years. Set in a New York City welfare office, Wiseman’s film paints a portrait of American social assistance as existing in a kind of perpetual defensive posture. It consists almost entirely of deeply suspicious interviews between the welfare office workers and the struggling people they’re ostensibly there to help, as the workers almost never seem to trust the people who’ve come in search of the assistance they need to survive. Each applicant who’s there to talk about a check that got lost in the mail or some other changed circumstance is kept at arm’s length with a verbal 10-foot pole, and subjected to a litany of questions that assume ill intent or ignorance of the office’s practices so profound that they don’t “deserve” help. This is 1975, just 10 years after the establishment of Great Society programs, but the Nixon-Ford push toward defunding these institutions is already underway. You can’t get rid of welfare and Medicaid altogether? Just make certain they’re so underfunded and understaffed they become hollowed out husks, their employees so overworked and undertrained that the people they are meant to help come to hate the very idea of government and are teed up to vote to dismantle it even further in the decades to come. Wiseman’s fly-on-the-wall approach relies upon luck and patience, and he captures lightning in a bottle with a particularly poetic welfare applicant who ends his film with a prophetic summation — not only of his situation, but also of what it says about where America was headed. He suggests that if this country does so little to help its own people — and make no mistake, this is a portrait of welfare as a system of loss and risk mitigation (with policing as a Band-Aid for everything) rather than one actually trying to help people and, you know, encourage a healthier, more productive, less aggrieved society — America would cease to exist by 1988. It’s taken a bit longer than that, but his prediction is clearly in the process of coming true. “Welfare” isn’t only a lucid portrait of the past, it’s also Wiseman’s most prescient vision of the future. —CB Not only the greatest journalism movie ever made, “All the President’s Men” is in some ways the ‘70s movie par excellence, with its combination of an absolute naturalism in its acting and writing — courtesy of an extraordinary script by William Goldman — and a subtle expressionism in the cinematography by Gordon Willis. Goldman made an extraordinary choice: To only adapt the first half of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward’s book, ending the film with Nixon’s second inauguration in January 1973. It takes some of the melodrama out of the story of Watergate, and puts the focus squarely on the journalistic process. One thing is certain: “All the President’s Men” features the greatest “phone acting” of all time, with extremely lengthy scenes of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford’s Bernstein and Woodward speaking with source after source to assemble a journalistic puzzle for the ages. In Goldman’s hands, this is dialogue that’s purely procedural, full of pauses and filler words and dead ends (only a little of Bernstein and his girlfriend Nora Ephron’s script rewrite that established Bernstein as “catnip to the ladies,” according to Goldman, made it in), and brought to understated but never less than thrilling dramatic life by director Alan J. Pakula, with Redford overseeing the entire production through his Wildwood Enterprises company. As he had achieved in his previous films of his “Paranoia Trilogy” (“Klute” and “The Parallax View”), Pakula creates a pervasive mood of fear — a fear that had threatened to become the animating force in American life. If anything, it turns out that we weren’t being paranoid enough. —CB Sometimes the smallest conflicts demand the largest canvases. Cinematographer Gordon Willis photographs New York City in black-and-white Panavision widescreen for “Manhattan,” infusing the on-screen metropolis with timeless romantic grandeur. The city’s ineffable beauty lies in tension with the neuroses of Isaac Davis (director and co-writer Woody Allen), a twice-divorced middle-aged comedy writer juggling a relationship with seventeen-year-old high school student Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) and his growing attraction to cerebral journalist Mary (Diane Keaton), who’s having an affair with Isaac’s married best friend Yale (Michael Murphy). While Allen invests himself in the autogenous problems of the cultured class, he often throws them in sharp relief by situating them within the splendor of their urban environment. Manhattan streets become a playground for intellectual gamesmanship and emotional bonding. A conversation about past lovers and contemporary trysts takes place against the transcendental darkness of the Hayden Planetarium. Gramercy Park whizzes by in the background as a desperate man runs to save a doomed romance. They consume the city, but can’t lose themselves in it. Willis’s visual beauty neither elevates nor obscures the self-involved headaches of Allen’s characters. Instead, it envelops them, imbuing them with a cinematic gloss while keeping them firmly relegated to the mortal realm. The quotidian, narcissistic concerns at the heart of “Manhattan”—trying to find love and meaning at all personal costs, forgoing integrity for immediate pleasure, deferring mortality by throwing oneself into art — still comprise the primordial goo of human experience. “You have to have a little faith in people,” Tracy tells Isaac at the end of the film, after he uses her, mostly to torture himself, and then blithely tosses her aside for a shot at Mary, only to regret it the second he’s alone again. The famous line — delivered impeccably by Hemingway, who gives a remarkably unaffected performance that still feels miraculous — prompts a silent, powerfully uncertain reaction from Allen that can be read a million different ways. The cathartic Gershwin score underscores the irony of the moment’s superficially straightforward catharsis: Allen’s film argues people are predictable and disappointing, and that the only faith to be found in them is the consistency of their corruption. What’s left is art, which, of course, is made by people. If life is only worth living because of art, and art exists because of (or maybe in spite of) people, and people are inherently corrupt, then is life worth living? The “unsolvable, terrifying problems of the universe” endure unabated. —VM At his core, Bobby Dupea is a searcher. Restless and irresolute, he’s determined to find purpose in a world that baffles him and amongst people who bore him. Born into an upper-class family of musical prodigies, Bobby rejects the comforts of his upbringing and his considerable artistic talents in favor of a hardscrabble blue-collar life. But it’s clear he doesn’t work on an oil rig or date a waitress with country western aspirations for the progressive optics, or even to alienate his family. His drive for adventure, to negate all semblance of former identity, comes from a sincere, obscure place buried deep in his heart. By 1970, this archetype — the privileged societal drop-out who leaves home to, per Simon and Garfunkel, “look for America” — had amassed some clichés in a post-Summer of Love culture. In the hands of most actors, Bobby Dupea would resemble a collection of affectations instead of a whole human being. But Jack Nicholson is not “most actors,” and thus he imbues the protagonist of Bon Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces” with the disordered interiority of a character from literature. He conveys his confused anger and deep-seated sorrow with casual grace, whether he’s trying to contain his uncouth, terminally sweet girlfriend Rayette (a remarkable Karen Black), or manage his barely-concealed contempt around his blue-blooded family, whom he reluctantly agrees to visit in the Pacific Northwest after hearing about his patriarch’s poor health. It’s only the presence of the earnest, grounded Catherine (Susan Anspach), a piano student studying at his family home who’s attracted to Bobby but can’t stomach his apathy, that challenges his hard exterior. The film is defined by an existential melancholy, accented by László Kovács’s painterly photography and conveyed through Nicholson’s performance. In its most famous scene, Bobby patiently confronts a stubborn diner waitress whose strict adherence to the establishment’s “no substitutions” policy has made it impossible for him to order a side of toast. (“You want to hold the chicken salad?” the waitress sneers. “I want you to hold it between your knees,” Bobby famously responds.) Though funny and righteous, the scene’s anti-establishment fervor is tinged with despair. However clever he may be, Bobby just can’t adapt to the customs of a diner, let alone his family or America. He doesn’t get his toast, he doesn’t land the girl he wants or already has, and he doesn’t find purpose. But as the ending indicates, nothing will stop him from trying. —VM Almost certainly the greatest student film ever made, “Eraserhead” was made by a young David Lynch with a budget of $100,000, a series of soundstages and sets owned by the American Film Institute, and a wife and child he was caring for at home. From those humble beginnings, Lynch created something immortal — a stark and enigmatic hallucination that feels untethered to any specific time or place, but continues to endure as a result of its hyper-potent elusiveness. Inspired by his experiences of fatherhood, and his time living with his young family in the Fairmont neighborhood of Philadelphia, Lynch transports “Eraserhead” viewers to an industrial landscape that feels devoid of light and hope, where the hapless hero (Jack Nance, with an iconic shock of frazzled hair) struggles to care for the strange monster his girlfriend gave birth to. With evocative black-and-white photography Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, along with unnerving sound design from Lynch himself that disorients at every turn, “Eraserhead” is a work of remarkable craft far beyond its modest origins — and a heartbreaking portrait of parental anxiety that will find purchase with a new generation of viewers for as long as movies can still find their cults. —WC Barbara Kopple’s landmark documentary opens with shots of Kentucky coal miners lying flat on a conveyer belt as they slide down the depths of the Brookside Mine, literalizing the pernicious capitalistic notion of human beings as tools. She spends the remainder of the film illustrating the dignity and resolve of those same miners as they strike against the Eastover Coal Company for refusing to honor their union contract with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Kopple’s righteous on-the-ground filmmaking goes within people’s homes and behind picket lines to capture the miners’ effectively confrontational tactics and the unsustainable conditions that made the strike inevitable, including Eastover’s indifference to basic safety standards, which lead to prevalent cases of black lung amongst the laborers, and the Duke Power Company’s record profit increases while worker wages stagnate compared to the cost of living. As “Harlan County, USA” makes clear, Brookside miners were never going to quietly die in squalor without a fight. Kopple leverages the best of vérité techniques to immerse audiences into Harlan County’s social and economic milieu while refusing to strictly adhere to direct cinema orthodoxy. She seamlessly incorporates archival footage, fly-on-the-wall observational footage of union meetings, direct interviews with miners and their wives, and spare use of expositional intertitles to situate viewers in the present-tense moment. Though her primary motivation was to document the struggle, Kopple rarely sacrifices aesthetics in pursuit of that goal. Close-ups of hardened miner faces often speak louder than their words. Transitional montages of poverty-line life soundtracked by folk music illuminate the necessity of labor conflicts in America. A magnificent single take depicts the strikers, who have blocked off a public road leading to the mines, demand the local sheriff deliver an arrest warrant to head gun thug Basil Collins, who sits in a line of cars waiting to threaten the picketers. “Harlan County, USA” typifies the emotional power of worker solidarity exhibited in union meetings and funerals, in demonstrations outside the Duke Power’s North Carolina and on Wall Street. Yet, Kopple is careful not to tip into convenient utopian thinking. As much as the film was created in part to generate a manual for labor organizers, she depicts how hard-fought gains can be just as easily nullified by a divided workforce or ineffectual union leadership. Rhyming with the opening scenes, “Harlan County, USA” closing sequence features miners leaving Brookside mine after another day of drudgery. Kopple’s point is potently unsubtle: as long as people need to work to live, and as long management believes in profits over people, the fight will continue. —VM Unsparing and uncompromising, Martha Coolidge’s debut feature documents its own creation while also re-staging the director’s adolescent rape. Coolidge’s metafictional approach provides the director and her actors — Michele Manenti, who plays Coolidge as a teenager and is herself a sexual assault victim, and Jim Carrington, who plays Coolidge’s attacker — the venue to process trauma without mitigating its horrors. The narrative scenes of a young Martha going on a date from hell and then having to face the judgment of her boarding school dorm-mates never once play like a chintzy after-school special, even as the audience remains constantly aware of their artificial nature. Meanwhile, the fourth-wall-breaking sequences, when Coolidge discusses rape culture and gendered approaches to sexuality with her actors, both of whom bravely commit to the project while also being rattled by the material, startle in their emotional honesty and notable lack of judgment. In the interim 50 years, Americans have become slightly — slightly — more conscious of the prevalence of sexual assault, the importance of consent, and the insidiousness of victim blaming. Yet, “Not a Pretty Picture” never once feels dated in its insights or approach. On the contrary, it feels sadly contemporary. By embracing the constructed unreality of her real-life memory while simultaneously witnessing actors dedicate themselves to its authenticity, Coolidge generates a quietly cathartic experience. “Not a Pretty Picture” never functions like an educational text (though Carrington admits the film could serve that purpose), and Coolidge doesn’t pretend to be in the business of imparting lessons on her actors or her audience. Still, it’s clear that everyone involved comes away affected by the project. Coolidge situates her cast and crew and the audience inside and outside her life-altering experience in order for them to viscerally feel her pain while also intellectually consider it. One of the great debut features of the decade, “Not a Pretty Picture” acutely understands that cinema offers an illusory space, one whose inherently manufactured nature allows memories to be projected and ensnared where they can be experienced without being relived. —VM At a retrospective screening last December, Elaine May clarified that while her downbeat buddy comedy “Mikey and Nicky” does have laughs, they’re “just not the cheery kind.” Inspired by May’s observations of low-level gangsters in Chicago, the film explores male friendship at its most abject, as two lifelong pals — one a maudlin drunk played by John Cassavetes, the other a practical family man embodied by Peter Falk — embark upon an ostensibly freewheeling nighttime journey towards a sobering and inevitable dawn. Misunderstood, like much of May’s work, upon its initial release, “Mikey and Nicky” has seen found its rightful purchase as a classic thanks to May’s incisive screenwriting and the believably desperate performances of her stars. —KR Among everything else you could say about George Lucas’s cinematic cosmic cocktail: Is this simply the most talked about movie of all time? If so, that makes finding something new to offer on the subject a major challenge. And yet, the richness of this work is such that there always seems to be another angle to explore. Like how a camera had never tilted and panned through a starfield before “Star Wars.” Or how the “Mos Eisley Cantina” theme is basically just Dixieland jazz with a little bit of the Charleston added in for good measure. Or the extraordinary narrative choice to just plunge viewers into the middle of the action and leave it to viewers to get their own bearings — there’s never an explanation of what a Jawa is or why they’ve suddenly kidnapped our droid heroes, they just are. You figure it out. That’s Lucas’s soft-spoken invitation to us to explore this galaxy on our own and find our own way around — and millions upon millions formed their own personal connection with “Star Wars” as a result. When you find your own way to something, it’s always a more powerful bond than when it’s imposed on you. Critics always like to point out the way that “Star Wars” stands on the shoulders of Old Hollywood adventure serials like “Flash Gordon,” but as much as Lucas excavated the past, he reinterpreted it too, through his generational post-Vietnam lens. Tunisia doesn’t just replace, say, Monument Valley for a desert landscape, Lucas also has it that the Empire massacres a group of indigenous people early in the film and clumsily tries to hide their murders by pinning it on another indigenous group. Then has the Empire destroy an entire planet, basically just because it can. For as much as it’s a standalone film, “Star Wars” is also a rewarding companion piece to “American Graffiti.” That film is all about a teenager questioning whether he really wants to leave home, about “refusing the call” in Joseph Campbell terms. “Star Wars” is all about what happens after, when you’ve actually left. How you have to find out who you are and what you’re made of, and put together a new family you find along the way. We may not have to take on a Death Star first thing, but the leap that we all have to take in growing up has rarely found a more universal expression than it does in “Star Wars.” —CB Humble Italian peasants living at the end of the 19th century serve as the collective protagonist of Ermanno Olmi’s gorgeously orchestrated, Palme d’Or-winning pastoral saga. Men, women, and children toll away day in and day out on fields that don’t belong to them — all to enrich the wealthy landowner while they struggle to survive on what little they are allowed to keep. Under these precarious circumstances, where every pair of hands is put to use doing manual labor, sending a child to school is a luxury few can afford. One couple decides to spring for it anyway, as the local priest has encourage them to nourish their boy’s God-given intelligence in the hopes that their sacrifice may pay off down the road. But that’s only one story in this boisterous farmhouse of tales. We also a widow trying to support her six children by washing other people’s clothes, and several young people who seek love in a reality where the death of a farm animal — or even something as small as a broken shoe — can test a family’s resilience. And as calamity befalls them, their only solace is the belief that somehow the grace of God will pull them from their desperation. The brilliance of Olmi’s ensemble piece lies in how organically, and unhurriedly, it weaves in and out of each family’s vicissitudes, while also offering glimpses into the unrest that’s brewing beyond the confines of this community. —CA From the poorly designed stunts that brutalized Ellen Burstyn and 14-year-old Linda Blair, to filmmaker William Friedkin’s infamous use of the so-called “practical scare” on set (he reportedly fired real guns at will to keep his actors alert), “The Exorcist” is a cinematic masterpiece — and horrifying in more ways than one. I haven’t even gotten into that mysterious studio fire, yet! The unnerving and electric possession of Regan MacNeil was adapted by screenwriter William Peter Blatty from his 1971 novel. The story, particularly its Georgetown setting, was inspired by a real case of attempted exorcism documented by the Catholic Church in 1948, but Blatty and Friedkin’s influence hung over the 1970s in the shadows of “The Exorcist” and its varied successors. Between works like Richard Donner’s monumental “The Omen” (1976), and John Boorman’s divisive, locus-infested “Exorcist II: The Heretic” (1977), not every cinematic follow-up to “The Exorcist” feels worthy of its association with the Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay. (It also took home Best Sound.) But you could argue the same thing about the countless generically named “Creepy Girl” props you’ll find resembling Blair in haunted decoration stands every Halloween… and who doesn’t love those? Worth making the predictable word choice to call it “head-spinning” at least once, “The Exorcist” begins slow — stewing in the sands of an archaeological dig that unleashes a terror from the pitch-black depths of hell onto a little girl and her woefully screwed mom in D.C. If you don’t know the face of Pazuzu yet, you will have that unholy magic burned into your brain after just one viewing. Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) tries his best, but decades later, the late actor’s son, who is now a genre filmmaker himself, is still grappling with what happened to the unlucky man on those godforsaken stairs. —AF The opening shot of blaxploitation was significantly more radical than what came after. Multi-hyphenate creator Melvin Van Peebles’ goal with this 1971 firebomb — which came in the wake of his first and only Hollywood production, “The Watermelon Man” — was nothing less than a complete annihilation of conventional cinematic form, as he defied every rule of Hollywood production and editing to create “the first Black Power film” (even going so far as to arm his crew). Bolstered by the support of the Black Panther Party and the tagline, “Rated X by an All-White Jury,” Van Peebles’ missive became a massive box office hit despite — or perhaps because of — its unblinking approach to sex and brutality. Fifty years on, “Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song” is still incendiary, challenging, and one of a kind. —KR An unsparingly nativist satire of colonial arrogance, Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ cinema novo masterpiece remains one of film history’s most cutting rebukes against the white savior narrative that it has done so much to propagate over the last 125 years. Set in 16th century Brazil, the deliciously titled “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” stars Arduíno Colassanti as an unnamed settler who’s captured by the indigenous Tupinambás — who believe him to be Portuguese — and told that he will be ritualistically eaten in eight months. It’s not a promising situation for our protagonist, but after being assigned a young wife (Ana Maria Magalhães as Seboipepe) and given free run of her village, our blond “hero” begins to grow comfortable in his new surroundings. He even starts to adopt the local customs and dress (or lack thereof), confident that his captors will come to recognize the savagery of their own customs in the face of his evolved Christian grace. He even appears to fall in love with Seboipepe, and assumes the feeling is mutual. Spoiler alert: There’s a reason why this movie isn’t called “I Didn’t Eat My Husband.” It turns out that Seboipepe is mostly concerned with claiming the best piece of white meat. From its title on down, “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” is inflexibly — gleefully — rooted in the perspective of the Tupinambás, whose understanding of the world has been untainted by the hegemony of the European invaders. That ahistorical point-of-view will ultimately lead to their extermination, but not before Pereira dos Santos is able to reverse the time-honored prejudices of Western filmmaking and create a story that identifies with the conquered at all costs. In doing so, he offers a bitingly sardonic reminder that history is easier to swallow than it is to digest. —DE A product of the Direct Cinema movement of observational documentary filmmaking that gave birth to masterpieces like “Grey Gardens” and “Don’t Look Back,” “Gimme Shelter” was born when directors Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were allowed to tag along on the final three weeks of the Rolling Stones’ legendary 1969 tour. What could have been a straightforward rock doc — featuring some impressive behind-the-scenes footage and performances from the legendary band — instead became a chronicle of something far greater when the filmmakers captured the infamous Altamont Free Concert that capped the group’s American leg, complete with footage of the killing of concertgoer Meredith Hunter. Shot with a hazy lens that appropriately feels like an acid trip, “Gimme Shelter” documents all the managerial and organizational failure that allowed the concert to descend into chaos, and the discordant, nightmarish events of the night itself. One of the rawest and most unvarnished non-fiction films of its time period, “Gimme Shelter” is more than a concert doc, its a portrait of a changing era, as the dreams of the ‘60s made way for the cynicism of the ‘70s. —WC Few actors embody everything great about ‘70s cinema better than Gene Hackman. A late bloomer who seemingly stumbled backwards into an acting career, his unvarnished everyman characters were highlights of many of the decade’s best films. And his talents were never put to better use than as Harry R. Caul (a homophonically droll name for a wiretapper), a surveillance expert who falls down a rabbit hole of paranoia after hearing what he believes to be dangerous information that could affect a couple he was hired to spy on. The performance takes a quintessential Hollywood archetype — the washed up man who has long sworn off morality after being haunted by past mistakes — and updates it for a world in which nobody felt like they could trust a word that anyone else was saying. Francis Ford Coppola, in the midst of his all-time great filmmaking run, is at the height of his technical powers, using intricately composed shots of San Francisco and brilliant sound design to illustrate Caul’s mastery of surveillance and his earned distrust in the people who employ him. But the stylization is all grounded in the sad portrait of the character’s life that Coppola and Hackman paint for us. I have personally never attended a surveillance equipment convention, but it’s not hard to imagine how quickly your trust would erode if you spent all of your days hanging out with private sector spies eager to brag about the latest answering machine they broke into. Amid a sea of self-described paranoid thrillers from a very paranoid decade, “The Conversation” stands out among the finest because it managed to meet a national moment without ever having to diverge from its protagonist’s natural truths. —CZ In the films of Jacques Rivette, Paris is less a city than a giant stage or playground upon which characters project imagined dramas, but none of his work takes that idea to a more fantastical extreme than “Duelle.” Here, Juliet Berto and Bulle Ogier’s cryptic femmes fatales are not merely young bohemians roaming around town making up conspiracies and mysteries to add spice to their lives but goddesses in mortal form engaged in a contest of wills that predates human life. As the women gradually orient themselves toward their latest cosmic confrontation, they occupy the rest of their time tempting mortals into their thrall with behaviors heavily indebted to classic noir. In the process, Rivette crafts an impressionistic tribute to everything from Marlene Dietrich’s collaborations with von Sternberg, Weimar-era expressionistic thrillers, even the lucid-dreaming poetic mythology of Jean Cocteau. Eschewing mere homage for a sublimation of past forms into something new, “Duelle” reconfigures the cinephilia of the Cahiers critic-filmmakers into a vision of cinema as timeless as the oldest myths of the ancient world. —JC Clint Eastwood was already the star and director of numerous westerns by the time he made “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” but it was here he fully emerged from the shadows of early collaborators Sergio Leone and Don Siegel to establish himself as the true heir to John Ford’s vision of the West. Physically and psychologically scarred by the Civil War, Eastwood’s Josey is a vision of rage so uncontrollable that the massacre of surrendering comrades by Union troops seems more a convenient excuse for inevitable bloodshed than justifiable cause. As in “The Searchers,” the film gradually pulls its protagonist back from the edge of damnation, but where Ford’s movie offers moral clarity at the last possible second, Eastwood’s confronts its hero’s anger throughout the story. As Josey assembles a makeshift caravan of Native Americans, harassed homesteaders, and other unfortunate souls, Eastwood draws constant but understated attention to the contrast between the Confederate’s aggrievement and the larger framework of racial, gender, and class violence in America. Slowly but surely, this wrathful Lost Cause thriller morphs into an unsentimental but nonetheless hopeful vision of community solidarity as the only true defense against the predations of individuals and systems. —JC Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1975, and still the only African film to have ever been awarded that prize, “Chronicles of the Years of Fire” is both a political epic and a personal account of Algeria’s struggle for independence. Director Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina stages the story with large-scale set pieces, poetic monologues, and sweeping cinematography. Crucially, however, he avoids triumphalism at every turn. Instead, his film traces how colonial violence reshaped everyday life and made revolt inevitable. It’s long, demanding, and often theatrical, but always urgent. Few African films have matched its scale, and even fewer have carried this kind of historical weight on the world stage. —TO Shudder’s “Dario Argento Panico” is an essential documentary primer for any cinephile just getting into the complex, supersaturated legacy of Italy’s most notorious genre filmmaker. Understanding the dark psychology of a man who conjured up unfathomable suspense and horror — then repeatedly cast his real wife and kids as exquisite centerpieces in those artful nightmares — is, how do you say, “tutta una cosa.” That’s Italian for “a whole thing,” and basically the entire point for dedicated fans of the director. Effectively standing in for a decade of brilliant giallo on this list, “Suspiria” is more than up to the task. The eerie magic Argento first conjured up in 1977 is best remembered for its illustrious use of color, even with “Deep Red” right there in the director’s filmography. The crimson splatters and jewel-colored glass that adorn the German ballet school where “Suspiria” takes place make it a crowning achievement in the pantheon of visual horror. That masterful dreamscape is reflected in the eyes of a young American dancer, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), whose serpentine descent into supernatural madness plays out like a lethal recital on psychedelics. Loosely translated, “Suspiria” means “breathing” or “to take a deep breath.” That quietly sensual undercurrent might explain why “Challengers” director Luca Guadagnino and “50 Shades” muse Dakota Johnson teamed up to revive Argento’s classic as a high-concept art film with a well-disguised Tilda Swinton in the critically-acclaimed remake from 2018. The original can’t evoke quite the same visceral response as that film’s updated effects, but anyone whose seen the atrium-hanging sequence should be able to convince you to watch both versions. Trite but true, there’s more than one way for a witch to step on your neck. —AF One of the final films by the great Luis Buñuel, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” moves from dinner party to dinner party in a disorienting haze, each moment bleeding into the next. True to its title, the cast of characters we follow are a group of six well-off French men and women, each containing a sense of smug satisfaction and an underlying restlessness in their comfortable, mannered lives. Their attempts to dine together are thwarted by a series of vignettes both “real” and dreamed, from terrorist attacks to ghostly encounters to the discovery that their lives are actually a stage play. Buñuel’s comedy is dry as a bone, with each absurdity readily accepted by the passive ensemble. The film pokes and prods them mercilessly, with each mishap peeling away at the fundamental spiritual rot within them. It’s that unflinching meanness towards its own characters that makes “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” one of the great satires in all of film history. —WC So much of Ingmar Bergman’s work was defined by the women who brought his intimate, existential dramas to life, and with whom he frequently had tempestuous romances off-screen. Kicking off an impressive late-period run from the Swedish auteur before his retirement in 1982, “Cries and Whispers,” gives one of his first muses — Harriet Andersson — a harrowing showcase that doubles as a reflection on how much time has passed since she was the ingenue launched to stardom by Bergman’s “Summer With Monika.” In this austere psychological tragedy, Andersson plays a noblewoman tucked away in a country manor dying slowly from disease, with two sisters (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin) who are distant to both her and each other. As flashbacks reveal the cruelties that curdled this family, Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist bathe the film in a stark red glow, bringing fire to an icy, despairing work. And Andersson is devastating as the frail woman at the center, giving her last leading performance for the director whom her career was forever intertwined. —WC Glowing and electric, George A. Romero’s masterful “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) is iconic for a reason. But the sequel that followed his feature debut a decade later, “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), lies at the heart of a truly beloved filmography. Despite studio interference and a lack of financial stability throughout his otherwise successful artistic life, Romero is remembered as the sensitive American filmmaker whose steadfast commitment to the underdog gave the cinematic undead their reputation for social consciousness. At their most memorable, scary movies have long reflected how we can do better as people — alone or en masse. Created after several years of its director exploring other less terrifying realms, Romero’s genre homecoming endures as a remarkable collaboration between him, co-producer Dario Argento, the musical group known as the Band Goblin (credited in the film as The Goblins), and special effects wizard Tom Savini. The strongest and most ghoulish worship comes from community, and the action, comedy, and horror film worlds socialize as much as the artists here. Set inside a shopping mall, “Dawn of the Dead” sees combat collide with corpses as the zombie apocalypse from the first movie blooms into a bigger production for Romero. This nightmare is more philosophically complex, too. (Not like “Day of the Dead” levels of enlightenment, but you know, within reason.) Romero’s script masterfully disassembles the concept of a literal safe house under capitalism to explore the complacency it breeds, and to suggest that even the bravest leaders among us won’t know to burn it all down until it’s too late. —AF Med Hondo’s 1979 epic is so compelling that merely describing it is sufficient justification for its inclusion on this list. Filmed aboard a reconstructed slave ship inside an abandoned French factory, with a budget totalling $1.35 million (making it the most expensive African film ever at the time), “West Indies” is a musical satire/non-linear historiography of French colonialism. It is a whirlwind of post-Fanon interpolations with an unsparing, furious clarity of purpose. Hondo paints the history of the Caribbean under French rule as one where revolution is co-opted by capitalism, where artistic expression is disallowed without sufficient cultural assimilation, and where violence and displacement persist under the guise of progress. All of this might have amounted to little more than a politically astute curio were it not for Hondo’s total command of Western spectacle. “West Indies” has some of the greatest musical numbers ever filmed, with a dizzying sense of scale, intricacy, and imagination. Hondo plainly outdoes many of the pop artists he satirizes. The result is a blisteringly intelligent referendum on the rotten core of Euro-American cinema, and an equally potent tribute to the resilient fullness of African cultures. —SB The money alone is notable: Made for less than $9 million, “Jaws” went on to make over $470 million in global returns, including a $260 million domestic take that earned it the top spot at the box office in 1975. The film toppled other high-powered hits like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Dog Day Afternoon,” all huge moneymakers that were decidedly non-blockbuster in nature. And “Jaws” was the first feature film to break $235 million in domestic returns. Steven Spielberg’s big hit — his first, and obviously not his last — paved the way for the massive tentpole features that now dominate the summer season, huge earners that capture both the zeitgeist and hefty audiences. The secret? It’s one that filmmakers of any generation can stand to learn, remember, and take to heart: the film is good. So many blockbusters not only eschew overall quality in service to whiz-bang entertainment and speedy fun, but they do it with truly disposal amusements. Nothing about “Jaws” is throwaway. Meticulously built from stem to stern, “Jaws” takes pains to steep us in the world of small-town Amity (it means friendship!) long before a seriously large and biblically pissed off shark makes mincemeat of many of its citizens and everyone’s nerves. Neatly divided into two distinct sections – a landlubbing first half that tracks a small town on the edge, none of it helped by a mayor who doesn’t really see a need to mess with holiday fun, no matter how many people die, followed by an alternately claustrophobic and just kinda fun death sail on the high seas — “Jaws” builds both its tension and character evolution with steady hands. While we may briefly wonder who is going to beat this thing – Ocean-adverse chief of police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)? Grizzled fisherman and battered war hero Quint (Robert Shaw)? Know-it-all wino marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)? – the real question is, who is going to survive and what the hell does that even look like? Luckily for us, “Jaws” itself endures. —KE Jacques Rivette’s prankish, exuberant, and restlessly energetic “Céline and Julie Go Boating” boasts one of the all-time great cinematic friendships. It’s also a total explosion of the rules of cinematic storytelling, and one of the most innovative features of the 1970s — no small feat. Dominique Labourier plays Julie, a reverie-prone librarian who meets Céline (Juliet Berto) in a sequence straight out of Lewis Carroll, as Céline keeps dropping objects that Julie can’t chase her down fast enough to return. That sets the stage for an enchanting, but never precious or twee, tale of doubles… in addition to a love triangle, a mysterious house, and a subplot about a psychedelic candy that allows the two women — who become fast friends and roommates after that chance meeting — to seemingly bend the rules of time altogether. Here’s where Rivette tosses yet another genre, the murder mystery melodrama, into “Céline and Julie” in ways that gleefully reinvent the very references he’s trying to make and then subvert. “Céline and Julie Go Boating” feels in many ways like the original hangout movie of the 1970s, bouncing along episodically, more jaunty picaresque than manic pixie dream girl omnibus. Despite running nearly three-and-a-half hours, this allusion-heavy (and illusion-heavy) movie is made totally accessible by Rivette’s disorienting and tradition-disrupting style. More than that, it feels like a fresh discovery each time you rewatch it. —RL “Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place,” says an Australian schoolgirl with dead eyes and a breathy, bated voice at a pivotal moment in Peter Weir’s lastingly elusive “Picnic at Hanging Rock.” Ushering in a New Wave of Australian 1970s cinema that put the country’s film scene on the global map, Weir’s masterpiece remains equally influential for contemporary filmmakers such as Sofia Coppola, who picked up Weir’s mantle as the cinema’s reigning master of dazed blonde women strung out on fainting couches. Like patterns in the clouds, you can read almost anything into the bottomless pit of mystery that becomes the center of this unforgettably strange portrait of sexual repression, written by screenwriter Cliff Green. It’s Valentine’s Day, 1900, at the fictional all-girls boarding school called Appleyard College, where a group of students head out toward a geological formation, Hanging Rock, in Victoria. Three vanish without a trace, seemingly into a crevice in the formation. The sighting of a strange red cloud that coincided with the three young women’s seeming evaporation into nowhere, as told by Edith (Christine Schuler), could be read as a limpid, subtle-as-a-chainsaw metaphor for looming femininity and the disappearances themselves as the loss of innocence into adulthood. More memorable than its symbolism, however, is the seductive, ethereal, and dread-spiked atmosphere “Picnic at Hanging Rock” conjures, leaving you in as dazed a spell as the protagonists whose dilemma remains stubbornly unsolved. That’s where Weir’s chillingly directed film gets its extraordinary power. —RL Banned after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and thought lost for decades, Mohammad Reza Aslani’s miraculous “Chess of the Wind” wasn’t widely seen until its 2020 restoration, when it arrived with the feeling of a priceless discovery. Set almost entirely inside a decaying aristocratic mansion in early 20th century Tehran, the film is a tightly controlled chamber drama about inheritance and control. A paralyzed woman battles her stepfamily for power, while servants lurk and loyalties shift in silence. The stillness is deceptive; every movement, glance, and sound is loaded with meaning. Its surface recalls the visual grammar of 1970s festival auteurs, but Aslani builds a world anchored in the historical textures of Iranian society, shaped by class conflict, gendered power, and a quiet subversion of patriarchy. Its formal control and long absence make it one of the most arresting rediscoveries in recent world cinema history. —TO The fate of the midnight movie is still pretty much at the mercy of kids who can’t decide if they should cancel each other for liking “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” But Brian de Palma’s “Phantom of the Paradise” reigns supreme as the definitive best piece of flashy genre cinema from the 1970s — a glorious ode to a rocker punished for his passion that was itself tortured on its rocky road to theaters. Thanks to a nonsensical legal challenge from Led Zeppelin, moviegoers have to be pretty lucky to catch De Palma’s extraordinary 1974 glam opera as it was meant to be seen. Censorship plagues all publicly available versions of the film, and a particularly egregious restoration from a physical media release a few years ago left many fans disturbed by the intricate production details lost to its poorly updated color. Still, whichever version you watch, the tragic tale of musical genius Winslow Leach (William Finley) shines through as a timeless testament to the power of talented freaks with a song to sing. Paul Williams scored “Phantom of the Paradise,” which also casts the Grammy-winning composer as the villainous namesake executive for Swan Records. Swan destroys what could be a quick rise to fame for Winslow and his band, The Juicy Fruits, when he steals the basis for their first hit song. Enter Beef (Gerrit Graham), a competitive diva whose effort to help Swan screw over Winslow ends explosively. The glittery terror that surrounds that reveal commingles bejeweled platforms and fishnets (with some of the more disturbing elements of the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story?) in a singular “Phantom of the Opera” homage. It also sees “Suspiria” final girl Jessica Harper centerstage as its fresh-faced Angel of Music in a performance that could almost make you forget the movies’ later attempts at creating their own Christine. —AF Dripping with style and sick with unease in its portrait of an emotionally detached man (Jean Louis-Trintignant) hired to assassinate his ex-fascist former professor, Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Conformist” illuminates its protagonist’s psyche with a scintillating dance of light and shadow — an approach that would have an enormous influence on Francis Ford Coppola as he ramped up to make “The Godfather.” Shooting in Rome and Paris as well as Cinecittà Studios in Italy, production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (unjustly robbed of an Oscar nomination for his hugely influential work here) summoned the vibes of 1930s Fascist Italy with extraordinary detail, emboldened by Bertolucci’s baroque style. At the center of this cold — but never bloodless — movie is the relationship between Marcello (Trintignant) and Anna (Dominique Sanda), the professor’s wife whom he falls in love with fatal consequences. Those consequences are realized in a disturbing and suspenseful sequence that elegantly summarizes the movie’s themes of cowardice, repression, betrayal, offering an ultimate reminder of Marcello’s own fecklessness. Antiheroes became a dominant trademark of 1970s cinema both abroad and in the United States; look toward the moral complexities of Marcello for an early figurehead of that trope, all wrapped up in a doom-laden but ecstatically glorious movie. —RL A three-part nonfiction epic, Patricio Guzman’s black-and-white masterpiece is unrivaled as the premier filmic document preserving the memory of Chile before, during, and after one of its most troubled chapters, which has defined its modern history. Starting in the months before military dictator Augusto Pinochet came to power by force, Guzman set his camera against a country in crisis. The first installment, 1975’s “The Insurrection of the Bourgeoisie,” hinges on the director’s interviews with working class people as they take to the streets to demonstrate in defense of Salvador Allende’s government, and to denounce how the elite has fought to maintain their privileged position at the expense of the masses. On the ground amid the turmoil, “The Coup d’état” goes on to bear witness to violent clashes, hopeful protests, ardent speeches, and ultimately to the U.S.-backed overthrow of Allende on September 11, 1973, which ushered in a dark period for the South American nation. The final part, “Popular Power,” winds back the clock to serve as something of a prequel, as Guzman explores the proletariat’s frustrated attempts at reclaiming their power. Although forced into exile for decades, the acclaimed filmmaker has since continued to observe Chile’s transformation over the years, and to investigate his own complicated relationship with the country of his birth in several subsequent works (including 1997’s “Chile, Obstinate Memory,” which found Guzman screening his trilogy for Chileans who had never seen it before). But none of those later projects, strong as they are, can hope to match the potency of watching history change from within the eye of the storm. —CA It’s impossible to study “Apocalypse Now” in a vacuum, as the film’s legacy will always be defined by the history surrounding it: the famously harrowing shoot that pushed Francis Ford Coppola to his limits and inspired the excellent documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse,” the dramatic Cannes premiere where Coppola’s massive bet paid off with a Palme d’Or win, and the director’s insistence to continue revising it into the 21st century. But even without succumbing to the crass temptation to use filmmaking as a metaphor for war, time and distance have proved that the chaos underscoring “Apocalypse Now” have only strengthened its legacy. The most appropriately pessimistic film by one of America’s greatest optimists, it’s now easy to see “Apocalypse Now” as the end of the New Hollywood era. That has far more to do with correlation than causation, but it’s also symbolically fitting: After a decade of watching the industry release auteur-driven films about the gaping hole that the Vietnam War left in America society, Coppola tackled the war that lurked over the decade’s other masterpieces so directly that it’s hard to shake the feeling that filmmakers moved on because there was nothing left to say. It would be impossible to determine exactly how much of the film’s chaos was pre-planned, and how much emerged naturally from a shoot so grueling shoot that it seemed as if God was determined to punish the auteur for his ambition. But Coppola’s vision resonated for a reason, and the pairing of his prescient foresight — about how the military would evolve in a direction of specialization that allows for even greater brutality — and the lucid observation that war brings out sides of men that they’re not capable of looking in the mirror proved to be a lethal combo. “Apocalypse Now” is New Hollywood radicalism executed on a scale that few of his peers ever received a chance to try. It’s a coda to two eras of American history, one artistic and one historical, and remains the definitive portrayal of a war that defined a generation. —CZ This isn’t to say that Hollis Frampton’s “(nostalgia)” is necessarily the greatest experimental film of the 1970s (competition for that useless title abounds, even from the other chapters of the artist’s “Hapax Legomena” film cycle), but rather to argue that it might be the most productive experimental film of the 1970s to put on a commercial-oriented list such as this one. Epitomizing the “structural” cinema movement that Frampton rejected as a coherent framework, “(nostalgia”) is a singularly potent gateway drug to another universe of moviemaking — one in which the shape of a film can be the ultimate expression of its content. To watch “(nostalgia”) is to discover, reconnect with, or simply exalt in the idea that there is something inherently profound, and in this case also extremely poignant, to the materials and construction of cinema itself. Here, the materials are simple, their construction is plain, and the deep well of feeling that Frampton conjures between them is raw, lucid, and inviting. Thirty-eight minutes. Thirteen photographs. One electric burner. A formative picture from the early days of the filmmaker’s career is placed on a hot plate, where it disintegrates in the flames as a plainspoken voice — speaking in the first person, but in fact belonging to avant-garde legend Michael Snow — discusses the image in the context of Frampton’s life. The images are evocatively unremarkable, the narration diaristic yet vaguely wounded. Old friends. Half-forgotten places. A pair of toilets sitting next to each other. Before long, the viewer begins to notice a glitch in the matrix: The narration isn’t describing the picture on screen, it’s describing the next picture to come. The effect is as temporally destabilizing as being ambushed by the smell of your childhood home: We’re hearing about a photograph we haven’t seen yet, and looking at a photograph we’ve already heard described. That basic misalignment is enough to create a strange and movingly porous middle ground in the space between anticipation and memory, as the pain of reflecting upon the past is dimensionalized by the natural human impulse to cast ourselves forwards into the future. Time eventually reduces it all to ash and silence, but not before Frampton is able to glimpse a fleeting truth of some kind in the movie’s dying seconds — a nowness that no other medium can give us. “Here it is. Look at it! Do you see what I see?” “(nostalgia)” is an invitation to never stop looking. —DE Has any director ever cared more about how a movie “feels” than Robert Altman with “McCabe & Mrs. Miller”? The film evokes wintry rain and snow and the puffs of dry heat from a pot-belly stove so well you almost feel like you can see Altman’s breath fogging up the camera lens. One of the greatest of all “winter Westerns,” this parable about commerce — and the role that affection and jealousy and violence play in the holding it all together — is an inimitable, oil-lamp-lit gaze into the past that also reflects the light of an eternal present at the same time. Warren Beatty wears a bear-skin coat so thick it makes you warm just to look at it. And he in turn warms the hopes of a small Pacific Northwest logging town with his card-playing skills, rictus grin, and declaration that he’s a “businessman.” Partnering with a veteran madam in Julie Christie, they open a brothel for the town, the one hope for salvation from the grim reality of the everyday — especially since the long-awaited Presbyterian Church is never quite finished. If transcendence isn’t possible, being a sinner can be the best way to endure capitalism. It sure encourages everyone to give it a shot. Pitched between a grimed-up materialism and dreamy aspirations — epitomized to perfection by the Leonard Cohen songs Altman put on the soundtrack with lyrics like “I’m just a Joseph looking for a manger” — “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is the greatest kind of period piece: One that isn’t an escape into the past, but a way to better understand how we arrived at the present. —CB Shot over a series of weekends in South Central Los Angeles, Charles Burnett’s “Killer of Sheep” remains one of the most quietly profound films in all of American cinema. With nonprofessional actors and a focus on everyday detail, it follows a slaughterhouse worker weighed down by routine and fatigue. There is no clear plot, just fragments of life, captured with care and restraint — every one of its images feels etched in stone but fully alive at the same time. Burnett, a key figure in the L.A. Rebellion, made a film about Black working-class life without any trace of sentiment or spectacle. Its 2007 restoration brought overdue attention, but the film has always carried the same lucid clarity and profound emotional weight. —TO Screenwriter Paul Schrader’s compulsion towards male isolation, modern disaffect, and the pursuit of transcendence that promises to alleviate them both has never been more potent than it remains in his original masterpiece. Each of the film’s unimaginably bold swings lands cleanly because the script does all of the little things right. As so many have pointed out, the appalling choice to make Jodie Foster’s Iris Steensma a literal child prostitute at just 12-years-old was the only way to create a moral travesty so utterly black-and-white that it could push a morally ambivalent man to forfeit his life for a cause. That transition from fringe observer to self-defined martyr unfolds with perfect cyclicality, affording Travis Bickle a Hero’s Journey within his own head without giving us any reason to believe that we’re leaving him any better off. “Taxi Driver” is in many ways the quintessential New Hollywood film, and so much ink has been spilled about what that means — from its unapologetic portrayal of post-Vietnam bitterness to its refusal to fully cut ties with the classic storytelling traditions of “The Searchers” — that blurbing Martin Scorsese’s most sordid masterpiece seems like a waste of bandwidth. But faced with the gravity of a true masterpiece, perhaps the most radical thing we can do is look at all the misinterpretations and cheap knock-offs it inspired and sincerely conclude that it was all still worth it to get the movie we did. It’s hard to think of a higher compliment to give a film than “You’re the reason we got two ‘Joker’ movies, and yet the world is still undeniably richer for your existence.” —CZ Paris in the daytime has never felt as desolate as it does in Jean Eustache’s 220-minute relationship drama. Presenting the collapse of May ‘68 as the intellectual equivalent of Paris’s fall to the Nazis, the film depicts the city as an eerily barren metropolis populated only by small groups of emotionally atomized citizens each absorbed in their own diversions and work. No one embodies this retreat into solipsism better than Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a student leftist turned reactionary in the wake of the progressive movement’s collapse at the end of the ‘60s. Ranting and raving about the failures of permissive society and the loss of traditional values, Alexandre nonetheless pursues two women he wants only for sex. Eustache’s film is an unsparing, eternally relevant overview of the manner in which jilted leftists can retreat into conservatism. The director even puts the ostensible progressivism of the French New Wave under a microscope, pointedly casting Nouvelle Vague poster child Léaud and positioning his character’s unchecked cinephilia as just one form of his fetishization of the past. But the filmmaker also depicts ongoing resistance of a kind, as the gradually forming bond between Veronika and Marie offers a refusal to submit to Alexandre’s attempted reassertion of chauvinist power — and a determination to retain the breakthroughs of the prior decade. —JC The most sinister and dreamlike of ’70s paranoid thrillers (its elusive sense of evil born from the unfinished state of David Giler and Lorenzo Semple Jr.’s script, the sociopathic disaffectedness of Gordon Willis’ cinematography, and the two-note twinkle of Michael Small’s synth score), Alan J. Pakula’s “The Parallax View” is a film born from the creeping unease that settled into American life as the country’s post-war idealism began to seem like the ultimate cover-up. It’s a cover-up that Warren Beatty’s guilt-ridden journalist is determined to uncover, and — in the wake of surviving a yacht explosion and foiling a bomb threat to a commercial airplane — it almost seems as if he might be able to expose the plot to assassinate the most progressive senators who popped up after Kennedy was gunned down. If only a thick feather cut and a dream were enough to set the world to rights. No such luck for the fearless Joe Frady, who finds himself at the center of a plot in which heroes are little more than handsome patsies, and villains hardly seem to have faces at all. Staged with hypnotic impassivity from the moment it starts (the spectacular opening sequence atop the Seattle Space Needle all the more impactful for its casual disregard), “The Parallax View” puts forward a much smarter and more calculated vision of a deep state conspiracy than the one we got. All the same, its closed-loop concept of American entropy — and its unnerving insistence that the truth can kill you without fully revealing itself — continues to resonate on a much darker wavelength than any of Pakula’s other ’70s classics. —DE First released 50 years ago, after Francoist censors convinced themselves that its anti-authoritarian messaging would have little social impact if buried under such a “boring” art film, Victor Erice’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” follows a gullible six-year-old girl named Ana (Ana Torrent), who sees a screening of “Frankenstein” when a mobile cinema arrives in the small Castilian village where she lives with her family in the Spanish Civil War’s immediate aftermath. Confused and horrified by the sight of Frankenstein’s monster accidentally killing a child, and the townspeople then killing Frankenstein’s monster in return, Ana’s elder sister tells her that neither of those things actually happened — that everything you see in films is fake. Later, with the memories of James Whale’s movie still fresh in her mind, Ana discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in a sheepfold and decides to treat him with kindness instead of fear. It makes no difference to his ultimate fate. Ana’s sister was only half right in the end: “Frankenstein” may be a work of fiction, but fiction isn’t the same thing as “fake.” Erice has only made three other features since his spellbinding debut, but all have been set in the same liminal space between film and reality that he explored in his first. As beguiling and hard to shake as any movie ever made (just ask Guillermo del Toro), “The Spirit of the Beehive” sinks so deeply under the skin for its ability to fulfill cinema — and “Frankenstein”’s — promise of eternal return; its capacity as a magic trick capable of keeping the past alive long after it’s already died within us. The movies are real, Erice has always insisted. This one allows you to see that clearly. —DE As unforgivable as it is to reduce an Andrei Tarkovsky film to a 1:1 allegory for a specific current event, it’s hard to watch “Solaris” these days without feeling like it was made for 2025. It was probably made for quite a few other years too (many of which haven’t happened yet), but watching AI-generated recreations of deceased crime victims give interviews on talk shows and statements in courtrooms is a convenient reminder that Tarkovsky’s wisdom was ahead of its time.No other science-fiction film has ever been so bold in its assertion that science as a vocation isn’t all that great. “Solaris” begins with the scientific community doubting each other’s testimony to the point where they send a psychiatrist into space to audit — and potentially shut down — a research mission. When the cosmonaut makes it to the space station, he discovers that the crew’s unsupervised observation of the strange magnetic fields surrounding the ocean planet Solaris have driven one person to suicide and caused dangerous hallucinations among everyone else. And yet, despite being armed with all of the prior knowledge that nothing he sees on the ship will be real, our hero is powerless to resist a vision of his dead wife, which is is enough to make him abandon his scientific principles for a cheap facsimile of someone he once loved. It’s a moment of intellectual weakness and a major lapse in professional judgement, but anyone who says they’d act differently is lying to themselves. Tarkovsky mines the tension between the lofty ideas that guide science and the fallen nature of the humans who try to pursue them, and this sprawling, highly symbolic film is rife with many of the ideas that fascinated him throughout his entire career: that there are secrets in the world that humans aren’t meant to understand, that we’re fools to try and analyze things that should only be experienced spiritually, and that esoteric quests for metaphysical meaning are only undertaken by broken people with nothing better to do. Looking out the window towards a society that appears increasingly convinced to invent the technologies that will burn it to the ground simply because we have the technology to do so, we’d all be well-served to remember one of the film’s most profound quotes: “We’re in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal he fears, that he has no need for.” —CZ “Days of Heaven” is a gem that has only grown more luminous with time. Filmmaker Terrence Malick was then still an emerging voice, now he’s viewed as one of American cinema’s most singular auteurs. After making his debut with 1973’s “Badlands,” Malick returned five years later with a film that’s as visually arresting as it is narratively elusive. Shot largely during the vaunted “magic hour” and steeped in natural light, “Days of Heaven” emerged from a notoriously difficult post-production process. The footage took two years to shape into a cohesive narrative, but the final product earned critical acclaim — and four Oscar nominations, including a win for Néstor Almendros’ haunting cinematography. Nearly five decades on — and with films like “The Thin Red Line” and “The Tree of Life” only expanding his mythos — Malick’s sophomore effort is seen not only as a foundational text in his body of work, but as one of the defining films of the ’70s. Its reputation rests not just on its painterly visuals, but on the dreamlike way it tells its deceptively simple tale. Richard Gere stars as Bill, a drifter who convinces his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) to pose as his sister so she can marry a dying farmer (Sam Shepard) for his land. Linda Manz, who also provides the film’s ethereal voiceover, plays Bill’s actual sister, tagging along as the trio’s fragile arrangement begins to unravel. Like “Badlands,” “Days of Heaven” is remarkably lean. Despite the drawn-out editing process, the film clocks in at just 94 minutes — a rarity in Malick’s later, more sprawling work. Within that brief running time, he crafts something hypnotic, lyrical, and emotionally resonant. The film’s centerpiece — a literal blaze of glory on a wheat farm — remains one of the most indelible images in American cinema. —RC An exploitation film released in 1974 with a title as shocking and to-the-point as “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was never going to struggle to earn back its $140,000 budget, but that didn’t stop Tobe Hooper from reaching for the moon and tearing an irreparable cosmic rift in horror cinema. Stripped of the artificiality that tended to soften the genre, Hooper’s unvarnished masterpiece subjected moviegoers to some of the most nauseating imagery ever captured on film without so much as a moment to take a breath. The practical effects and the barbarity of the tool-powered killings hold up to this day, but it’s because of the film’s deceptively sophisticated pathos that it’s so entrenched itself in our collective psyche. Leatherface isn’t motivated by the kind of malice or revenge that drive so many other horror villains — he’s a mentally disabled man raised by a perverse family with no means of supporting him after their jobs at the slaughterhouse disappeared. Forgotten by a society that was already beginning to rot, his family’s brutal actions were underscored by the notion that something similar could be lurking at the end of any innocuous-seeming country road.The scariest part of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is its utter nihilism. Hooper’s film remains so unsettling because of how blatantly it rejects the binary of good guys and bad, binary, offering us all a hideous reminder that we’re all just animals who are capable of inflicting unimaginable evils on each other once the paper-thin norms separating us from our instincts start to crumble. —CZ It’s all bad vibes and dark times in Nicolas Roeg’s hugely upsetting, weirdly tender, not quite sexy but surprisingly carnal study of mourning, “Don’t Look Now.” Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland bare it all and so much more as a WASP and a British Protestant who stare into the abyss of the absolute worst thing that could happen to any two parents — their daughter drowning in the shallowest of ponds, right outside their own English countryside home. Where most contemporary horror movies that center on grieving couples (i.e. “Antichrist,” which blurs Roeg into Tarkovsky) tend to fling them to, say, a remote cabin in the woods as a backdrop for healing, “Don’t Look Now” instead sends its grief-dazed protagonists to the crowded canals of Venice, Italy. It’s there that Sutherland’s character, John Baxter, has agreed to restore an ancient church, hauling Laura —who seems almost suspiciously emotionally blinkered given recent events — along with him. But the city’s rabbit-warren corridors, as established in Daphne du Maurier’s source novel, become M.C. Escher-esque grief portals as Laura becomes obsessed with a pair of supposedly psychic geriatric sisters. Meanwhile, there is a small person with a red hood — the very one the Baxters’ daughter wore the day she died — running around the city. “Don’t Look Now” is most infamous for a sex scene nested within Roeg’s trademark style of cross-cutting, in which two events in parallel yet discrete timelines appear to be happening at once. John and Laura are both dressing and undressing, fucking and then not fucking, with armpit-licking and cunnilingus that shocked audiences and censorship boards and by present day standards certainly isn’t prude. But what it wasn’t, and isn’t, is gratuitous. On the contrary, it situates “Don’t Look Now” as more emotionally raw-nerved romantic drama than true horror movie. Though you can’t forget the climax, which is one of the greatest of all cinematic rug-pulls, made all the more incredible by the fact that Roeg got away with it. This is the original “elevated horror”: knockout performances, skillful craft, and a director who undersides the dual sides of manipulating and cajoling actors and who can elevate schlocky material. —RL According to Elia Kazan, Barbara Loden’s last words — which she furiously spoke on her deathbed as her body gave out from breast cancer — were, “Shit, shit, shit.” Throughout their professional collaboration and marriage, the director — who cast actress-turned-filmmaker Loden in “Splendor in the Grass” — allegedly tried to undercut her autonomy and dismissed her creative ambitions. But the ambition of a woman operating below the studio system and out from her ex-husband’s eye paved the way for Loden’s “Wanda,” a troubling, often grimly hilarious and Cassavetes-adjacent landmark in the history of independent film. Played by Loden herself, Wanda is as apathetic as any woman as we’ve seen onscreen, languishing through life amid a pile-up of disappointments: She’s left her husband, granting him full custody of their children, and doesn’t protest when it’s time to sign the divorce papers. Loden, who had two children with Kazan, modeled the character after a version of herself: wandering, adrift, between jobs and between men, wedding her autobiography to a thinly sketched bank robbery plot that’s more background noise than the thrust of this existential tone poem of a 16mm-shot movie. One of the wisest, most piercingly drawn scenes in “Wanda” finds the heroine idling through a shopping mall, matching eyes with mannequins that both reflect her own soul-drained blankness and the status divided between her dreams and achievements, these life-sized “human” models adorned in clothes she could never afford. Here is one of the great portraits of a woman trying to find a place in the world, her world; she doesn’t find it by the end of the film, but the largesse of strangers (for food, for conversation, for cigarettes, for companionship) is enough carry her through another day. —RL In a pivotal decade of Hindi cinema, one film towers above the rest: “Sholay.” Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 Western, penned by Salim-Javed, was initially panned and pegged as a flop, but a stark turn in fortune would soon put it on its path to legend. Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra star as Jai and Veeru, two petty criminals hired by former inspector Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) to catch the deadly bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) — alive. The duo’s friendship is the emotional core of a film filled with love, loss, and vengeance, with supporting performances by Hema Malini, A.K. Hangal, Jaya Bachchan, and more. Indian films love to experiment with tone and genre, but the confidence of “Sholay” set a golden standard. It starts as a buddy comedy filled with heists and hijinks, then slips into the sweet mundanity of village life with its rose-colored promises of the future. After Gabbar’s introduction, it goes full Western (but not without a ridiculous detour into Veeru’s love life). To watch “Sholay” is to be sublimely entertained — amused, shocked, charmed, moved, and everything in between — and captivated by a voracious kind of filmmaking that grows rarer by the day. Bachchan and Dharmendra’s magnificent duo drives the film, and also parallels the pairing of Kumar’s dignified resolve and Khan’s anarchic villainy. R.D. Burman’s soundtrack delivered nostalgic hits like “Yeh Dosti” and “Jab Tak Hai Jaan,” which drive the story rather than interrupt it, and Salim-Javed’s dialogue is quoted across India to this day. It’s extraordinary that “Sholay” became one of the most famous movies ever made, and all the more extraordinary that it earns every bit of its enduring popularity. —PK John Cassavetes, his wife Gena Rowlands, and his dear friend Peter Falk created a total explosion in 1974 with “A Woman Under the Influence,” which features some of the most searing and self-possessed screen acting of all time. Gena Rowlands’ turn as mentally anguished housewife Mabel Longhetti remains a peerless master class — an embodiment so soul-deep that it’s no exaggeration to suggest that it completely dissolves the barrier between performance and reality. But Falk holds his own as her husband Nick, who careens from serene — and sensitive to his wife’s condition — to throwdown impatience over her antics yet again, and again, and again. Originally, Rowlands and Cassavetes (who does not star in this film) envisioned “A Woman Under the Influence” as a stage play, but the intensity of Nick and Mabel’s emotional knockout fights — leading up to Mabel eventually being all but 5150ed — would surely have flattened Rowlands too greatly if she had to live it on stage multiple nights a week. Without studio backing, Cassavetes seemingly made the film with glue and paper clips, but you wouldn’t know that from the extraordinary control of craft on display, as much as “A Woman Under the Influence” doesn’t exactly present itself as a controlled film. It would be more accurate to describe it as a dizzyingly beautiful display of control being lost — of a free fall in motion. Some 50 years later we’re still waiting to hit the ground. —RL “Chinatown” is almost un-blurbable, and not only because it’s a film of such classical perfection in its Old Hollywood construction that its cavernous depths can only be fully appreciated with viewing after viewing after viewing. There’s the first viewing, where it’s easy to be taken in by its surface pleasures: John A. Alonzo’s nicotine-stain cinematography, Polanski’s apex-noir shot choices, Robert Towne’s seen-it-all dialogue, Jerry Goldsmith’s ominous lament for solo trumpet, little detective-movie touches like Gittes putting a pocket watch under a car tire to capture the time that someone’s peeled away, Faye Dunaway talking about the flaw in her iris. All of it is intoxicating. Then, maybe on the second viewing, you find yourself compelled to dig deeper into the real history of a city that literally stole its water from the poor farmers of Owens Valley in order to become “L.A.” — a city of hunger built on thirst. Only in the viewings after that do the full crepuscular depths of this film’s black beating heart fully pump their way into your own bloodstream. John Huston’s Noah Cross is immediately shocking and repellant, but it’s only with prolonged exposure that one begins to recognize how deeply the personal, sexual, and political violence Cross represents is part of the historical fabric of this country. The ultimate act of a city and a nation holding a mirror up to itself (as is usually best achieved by an outsider to both, one indelibly marked by tragedy himself in his temporary adopted country), “Chinatown” is really a mirror held up to a mirror, reflecting back a city and its dream reflections of itself over and over and over again. “Chinatown” is the famous shot of a million Charles Foster Kanes repeated to infinity in Xanadu’s mirrors as an entire feature. It’s Jimmy Stewart looking into the abyss off the bell-tower roof in “Vertigo.” It achieves that effect with a singularly devious subtlety. “Chinatown” is an example of how true mastery always trumps virtuosity — restraint over flash, craft over spectacle. It’s a cinema that’s grown up, that doesn’t believe in the lies of its dreamtown or of the medium best associated with it, but finds those lies ever-intoxicating and irresistible nonetheless. And it always comes back for more. —CB Rainer Werner Fassbinder effortlessly took to science fiction in “World on a Wire,” reorienting his recurring use of reflective surfaces as a means of illustrating both surveillance-state dystopia and identity confusion over the simulation program that presents its wired-in residents a false reality. That this simulation exists not merely to produce more docile citizens, but also to act as a kind of aggressive consumer testing for capitalist interests, only further stresses the dehumanization of the premise. For all of its heady concepts, however, the film finds the director frequently cutting loose with ideas, using the excuse of a constructed reality to freely blend imagery of 20th-century Germany and pop culture. A timely disco rave rubs up against a Weimar-esque cabaret, and the soundtrack runs the gamut from a performance of Marlene Dietrich classic “The Boys in the Back Room” to Fleetwood Mac. This is one of Fassbinder’s most daring tribute/critiques of his nation’s addled and divided sense of self, at once at the cutting-edge of technology, economic growth, and culture but freighted by the immense burden of a history that lurks around every corner. —JC From the ashes of an aborted Napoleon film, Stanley Kubrick fashioned one of the most lushly beautiful movies ever made out of William Makepeace Thackeray’s picaresque novel about an Irish rogue who cons his way from lowly ruffian to nouveau riche nobility and back down again. Pioneering techniques for shooting in low-light and candlelit conditions, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott capture painterly landscapes worthy of Watteau and intensely detailed, densely populated interiors indebted to cheeky 18th century artist William Hogarth. Even the director’s usual icy mood and arch critical distance cannot preclude an immersive quality almost entirely unseen in period cinema to that point. Beneath the surface, though, “Barry Lyndon” is one of Kubrick’s funniest movies, wielding Ryan O’Neal’s prickly personality to reflect the way that Barry’s social-climbing schemes usually succeed through bullheaded stubbornness rather than adroit manipulation. Ryan O’Neal’s Barry is a loathsome boor who keeps failing upward, finding along the way that people at every rung of the hierarchy are equally petty and venal and differ only in their ability to dress up these flaws in politesse. —JC Djibril Diop Mambéty’s “Touki Bouki” is one of the most stylistically inventive films of the 1970s. Made on a shoestring budget in post-independence Senegal, it follows two young lovers as they scheme to escape Dakar for Paris. The film’s fragmented editing, layered sound, and erratic structure reflect the characters’ restless desire to leave — as well as their confusion about what leaving really means. Both home and destination are shaped by the same colonial past. A landmark of African cinema, “Touki Bouki” remains a singular, disillusioned portrait of youth caught between dreams and dislocation. —TO A smirking meditation on authenticity that profiles art forger Elmy de Hory, hoax biographer Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles’ Yugoslavian paramour Oja Kodar as part of an elaborate attempt to disguise its own trickery, “F for Fake” isn’t just cinema’s most playful self-portrait, it’s also its most dazzling statement of purpose. “Art is a lie that makes us see the truth,” Welles quotes Picasso as saying, and “F for Fake” offers an impossibly fitting gracenote to the career of an American titan whose work — from “The War of the Worlds” to “Citizen Kane” and beyond — hinged on the power of showmanship in a world all too eager to believe its own eyes. And ears. “For the next hour,” Welles proclaims in the first reel, “everything in this film will be based on solid fact.” But it’s the rest of time that “F for Fake” is most concerned with, and Welles’ fascination with charlatans, forgeries, and doublespeak indeed cuts deeper than ever at a time when we’re all at the mercy of our worst hucksters. To revisit this endlessly knotted Magic Eye puzzle of an essay film today is to appreciate that nothing has changed beyond the sloppiness of the world’s sleight-of-hand. As Welles says of Irving’s fraud: “It may well be the hoax of the century, but, really, this is not, you know, in any way the century of the hoax. We hanky-panky men have always been with you.” And they always will be. If only they took as much pleasure in it as Welles did. If only they gave so much of that pleasure back to us in return. —DE Released a year ahead of America’s bicentennial, Robert Altman’s panoramic view of celebrity and politics represents a high point of Altman’s experimental naturalism. Joan Tewkesbury’s script — or blueprint, given Altman’s tendency to improvise — splits the difference between New Journalism field reporting and biting social satire. The question of whether “Nashville” celebrates or condescends to the music and people of the eponymous setting still incites debates. The film’s poignant, downbeat ending recalls the political assassinations that dominated the previous decade and presages the shocking celebrity-based violence that would come to define the remainder of the century. As Altman’s film strenuously argues, everyone wants to be famous, no matter what the cost. We’re way past the point where identifying that celebrity and politics are two sides of the same coin can be considered a novel observation, but Altman never lectures the audience about the idea anyway. He merely integrates it into the infrastructure. The gap between unseen populist presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker, whose banal observations blare through the streets like hokey pabulum, and the aspiring singers that flit through the film’s margins is as thin as paper. Only Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), the fragile country singer constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, seems to recognize that fame is merely a gateway to being used by friends and strangers alike. Like all great works, “Nashville” uses its narrow scope to probe at universal ideas—about the ways social environments breed and warp personal aspirations and how the proliferation of images permanently distorted reality. In one sense, “Nashville,” much like lothario singer Tom Frank, played by Keith Carradine, is easy, at least to describe in the abstract. But it’s much more difficult to explain the feeling of being immersed in its world. Altman and his players construct a lattice of pleasures and heartbreaks, vulnerable desires and duplicitous actions, local struggles and national wounds that rarely feel contrived or artificial. So much of the film feels like listening in on people’s lives, catching glimpses of their personalities as they move through the world, and projecting joy or sorrow onto their behavior. Altman allows his audience to get to know his characters, but he also keeps them at a crucial distance. It’s not unlike the experience of having a long chat with a stranger at a bar: you get to know them, but you will never perceive the full picture. This clash between familiar intimacy and fundamental unknowability at the heart of “Nashville” lends it a uniquely peerless quality. Fifty years later, It’s still one of a kind. —VM The first time you watch Nagisa Ōshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses,” it might seem like more of a horror movie than a love story. This is, after all, a claustrophobic — and broadly true — saga of erotic obsession from the most hostile of Japanese auteurs; a mad and scandalous work of art that’s full of unsimulated sex, peppered with a massacre’s worth of little deaths, and topped off with a scene of genital amputation so unflinching that it feels like an answer to the eyeball cut in Buñuel’s “Un Chien Andalou.” Even if you’re willing to consider that Abe Sada chops off Ishida Kichizō’s penis as an act of love and mutual liberation, it still hurts to watch. The most notorious and universal of Ōshima’s transgressions, “In the Realm of the Senses” has never been at risk of aging, but its carnal revolt against the rising tide of militarism has only become more relevant over the course of recent years, as has its naked and pungent reaction to the dangers of living in a country that’s ashamed of all the wrong stuff. “Love of a country is a strange thing,” Ōshima once said. “Just puffing out your chest with national pride and telling people how wonderful your country is does not constitute love of country as I see it. You have to tell the truth about your country, whatever it is.” Ōshima saw “In the Realm of the Senses” as a chance to seduce people into looking at themselves. It would be erotic but not titillating, arousing but not exploitative. It would offset the mucus, viscera, and verisimilitude of hardcore porn with the matter-of-factness of a nature documentary. In the end, it does all that and more. The film gradually becomes so cocooned inside its crust of dried sex that viewers start to get turned off just as they begin to realize there’s nowhere else for them to go. —DE A singularly crucial text in the myth of Werner Herzog, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” endures as cinema’s most lucid (self)portrait of the madness that some men develop in response to the sheer poverty of their own power — in response to the hard fact that death is the only destiny that nature has put aside for them. It’s a film about how the hardness of that fact compels such men to invent a new destiny for themselves; how it gives them the will required to lead a suicide march in search of El Dorado, or in Herzog’s case the will to recreate one. The ecstatically true story of the 16th century conquistadors who splintered away from Gonzalo Pizarro’s expedition and disappeared into the Amazon rainforest, never to be seen again, “Aguirre” is steeped in a fever from its opening shots, which find the Spaniards forcing their slaves down through the clouds of the Urubamba Valley as if descending into heaven. The biblical drama of the Peruvian landscape is further exaggerated by the clinical disinterest Herzog takes in the the human folly he stages against it (a reflection of the apathy the jungle shows to us all), which is set to the novocaine-like numbness of Popol Vuh’s airy score, and unravels with the natural calm of river water floating downstream. Klaus Kinski’s feral performance as the demented Aguirre is all the more affecting for how it preserves that sense of calm amid his character’s increasingly grandiose delirium. The actor’s jagged face had long struck Herzog as the only human landscape that could fully convey the destructive indifference of nature itself, and here in the first of their violent and spectacular collaborations Kinski is so possessed by mad pride that he seems to wield the wrath of god to the same degree he suffers from it. Movie characters have never been more primitive, but in a film so cut to the bone — a film whose abject denial of poetry suffuses every scene with an inescapable unreality — Aguirre’s wide-eyed sense of purpose is no less divine than Herzog’s determination to capture it on camera. —DE Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) didn’t just explode the sci-fi genre — it redefined what it meant to make a blockbuster with brains and blood. A haunting, slow-burn thriller with the visual sophistication of an art film and the unrelenting terror of a monster movie, “Alien” pushed the boundaries of genre cinema and delivered a protagonist who would go on to reshape the cinematic landscape: Ellen Ripley, played as only the brilliant Sigourney Weaver could. Weaver isn’t even the first name you see in the opening credits — that honor goes to Tom Skerritt — but by the time the credits roll, there’s no mistaking who this film belongs to. Ripley doesn’t start off as the obvious hero. She becomes one — forged in trauma, quick-thinking, and sheer will. Her emergence 45 minutes in, amid a cascade of terror, feels revolutionary even now. Scott’s decision to re-gender the lead (originally written as a man by screenwriter Dan O’Bannon) was a seismic move. In an era dominated by masculine action heroes — from “Apocalypse Now” to “Moonraker” — Ripley was a revelation: competent, logical, unshakably brave, but never stripped of her humanity. She doesn’t just survive the alien. She outwits it, outlasts it, and in doing so, becomes the rare kind of cinematic icon who actually earns her place in the pantheon. Weaver’s final showdown — flamethrower in hand, fear in her eyes — is the ultimate mic drop on a decade of genre excess. She saves the ship, the cat, herself, and maybe cinema itself. “Alien” isn’t just one of the best films of the ’70s. It’s a blueprint for how genre filmmaking can be smart, subversive, and unforgettable. Want the job done right? Send Ripley. Send “Alien.” —KE Francis Ford Coppola devotees — and Coppola himself — often like to describe “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” as one single, seamless film. But that well-intentioned praise falls short of capturing what Coppola actually accomplished with his sequel. After all, the only thing harder than making “The Godfather” might be embarking on a follow-up to an era-defining film that is universally agreed to have a perfect ending. Coppola had more resources at his disposal the second time around, but the expectations were infinitely higher as well. Nevertheless, he still found a way to deliver a movie that deepens the ideas established in its predecessor without resting on its laurels or undoing any of the magic. Rather than give audiences more of the same, Coppola dove head first into a bifurcated narrative structure that illustrates the way the Corleone family’s future is inextricably linked to its past. As Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone sinks his claws deeper and deeper into a life that his father never wanted for him, relative newcomer Robert De Niro fills the massive shoes left behind by Marlon Brando in an origin story that washes away all of the lies these mafiosos tell themselves about their line of work: At the end of the day it isn’t about family or survival, but a simple raw lust for power and revenge that can never be satisfied. “Part II” will never be quoted or referenced as much as its predecessor, and it’s slightly easier to walk away from if you happen to stumble on a half-finished basic cable broadcast while flipping channels. But what it sacrifices in montage-able moments, it more than makes up for with its textual depth. The first film is a straightforward gangster movie executed at the highest possible level, but the follow-up is a morality play of cosmic proportions. Coppola never shies away from Michael’s original reluctance to seize the throne or the downsides of the job, but “Part II” rips away every semblance of glamour and shreds the family structures that made Michael’s success possible until we’re forced to discard every interpretation except the reality that none of this was worth it. If “The Godfather” is the ultimate movie about a man who decides to sell his soul, “Part II” is just as definitive a portrait of what happens when the universe shows up to collect what it’s owed. —CZ It’s “The Godfather.” Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 masterpiece remains one of the definitive films of the ‘70s — a decade that stands for cinematic reinvention and a Hollywood-backed turn to more nuanced storytelling. More than just a “gangster movie,” it’s an operatic meditation on power, family, and corruption, wrapped in a mythic tale about the real price of the American Dream (read: pretty damn steep). And actors, boy, did we have actors back then. Marlon Brando’s unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone brought a weary, commanding presence to the screen, embodying the complex patriarch at the heart of this crime dynasty. Meanwhile, Al Pacino’s evolution from hesitant outsider to ruthless Mafia boss offers a masterclass in character transformation that fueled the film’s emotional core. Their performances, alongside one the best ensembles to ever be assembled on-screen, anchor a story that’s as intimate as it is epic. Coppola’s direction pairs perfectly with Gordon Willis’ iconic “shadow play” cinematography, creating a visual palette that feels both grand and suffocating — a world drenched in darkness and moral ambiguity. Nino Rota’s haunting score adds a layer of melancholy that lingers beyond the screen, turning every scene into something timeless. Even all these years on, few films have been able to so ably interrogate what it truly costs to succeed in America, exposing the price of loyalty, power, and legacy with unflinching honesty. Decades later, “The Godfather” remains a cultural touchstone, shaping not just the gangster genre but the very language of American cinema in the 1970s. It’s a film that captures the era’s restless spirit while standing as a timeless masterpiece. Not just one of the best films of the ‘70s, one of the best films of all time. We don’t see that changing any time soon. —KE Chantal Akerman’s anti-epic is a film composed of all the quotidian bits of life that are usually elided through editing, its construction foregrounding how the daily tasks we consider too boring for the silver screen are more often than not also traditionally viewed as “woman’s work.” Akerman captures every chore of Delphine Seyrig’s housewife in such excruciating detail that even her moonlighting sex work becomes just another line on the to-do list alongside preparing meals and cleaning. And yet, in its deliberate lack of incident, “Jeanne Dielman” slowly wrings tension out of the most banal variations on rigid schedules. A dropped utensil generates a jolt akin to Raymond Burr finally looking up into the camera in “Rear Window,” and a break in Jeanne’s tic of turning off the light when she leaves a room hints at a blurring of her separate lives as a housekeeper and sex worker. These infinitesimal discrepancies accumulate like chaotic fractals that prefigure an explosive finale that would feel abrupt and nonsensical without them but becomes a logical catharsis thanks to the subtle breadcrumb trail Akerman scatters over three hours. In its own way, “Jeanne Dielman” is as radical a synthesis of cinematic possibility as has ever been made, and one of the finest distillations of just how much can be communicated through blocking and precise editing over dialogue. —JC “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” has been seen as a cursed object since before it first premiered in the fall of 1975, three weeks after writer-director Pier Paolo Pasolini was tortured and then killed on a beach in Ostia; his murder remains unsolved in the strictest sense, but all signs point to the crime as an expression of the same fascistic impulse that his final film so fearlessly distills into its purest form. Immediately censored, widely banned, and so enduringly controversial that the likes of Alec Baldwin was compelled to defend its honor in a legal brief as recently as 2009, “Saló” has become synonymous with the extreme, the verboten, that which is beyond the bounds of good taste. Its title is a veritable shorthand for something difficult to stomach. And yet, to recognize that some people continue to be more perturbed by Pasolini’s film than they are by the pornographic cruelties of the world that inspired him to make it is to recognize why it was necessary for him to make it in the first place. Loosely adapted from the Marquis de Sade’s “The 120 Days of Sodom,” its 18th century debaucheries updated for the final days of the Mussolini regime, “Saló” tells the story of four ghoulish libertines who kidnap 18 teenagers, abscond to a remote mansion, and subject their innocent hostages to several months of extreme degradation. The youths are at the absolute mercy of their captors, who assume total control of their bodies across a series of dehumanizing rituals that begin with rape, progress to shit-eating, and ultimately climax in a mess of medieval barbarities. Vile enough on its face, Pasolini’s film is thoroughly suffused with the soullessness of its villains (particularly Aldo Valetti’s anus-obsessed “President,” whose crooked smile is more frightening than any of the tortures Pasolini’s cast had to fake for the camera); from Ennio Morricone’s jaunty opening tune to the upsetting symmetry of Pasolini’s compositions and the persistent sense of “fun” that stains even the worst of the horrors framed within, “Saló” insists on being received as a Dantean parody of the dictatorships and puppet states that destabilized so much of the 20th century, and continue to recur throughout history. “The one true anarchy is that of power,” the fanatical Duke proclaims, and “Saló” remains cinema’s most confrontational — and therefore most necessary — vision of the perverted chaos that autocrats seek to create under the guise of state control. —DE In the dying moments of the 1970s, Bob Fosse re-centered American cinema on the personal and hyper-subjective with “All That Jazz,” shattering the end of a decade whose movies had been fiercely preoccupied with the fractiousness of the social order. Here, in his penultimate film and greatest masterpiece, Fosse’s personal demons are on full, dazzling display, as the jazz dance legend electrifyingly fictionalized how his various addictions reached a fever pitch while editing “Lenny” at the same time as he tried to mount “Chicago” on Broadway. In doing so, Fosse’s diaristic hall of mirrors pushed the entire genre of movie musical itself into the self-reflexive headspace that it’s occupied ever since (as can be seen in everything from “Dancer in the Dark” to Annette” and, naturally, “Chicago”). “All That Jazz” blends fantasy and reality — memory and delusion — to create a celluloid autobiography that remains unparalleled for its raw emotional honesty and proximity to its subject, with Roy Scheider boldly and beautifully embodying Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon. He’s a chain-smoking, Dexedrine-popping, booze-guzzling workaholic, the kind of bottomless pit of a man who tells his girlfriend (played by Fosse’s protégé and real-life romantic partner Ann Reinking), when she says “I wish you weren’t so generous with your cock,” that he might like to use that line in a screenplay. “All That Jazz” also doubles as a sensational, shaggy backstage docudrama about the makings of Fosse’s song and dance — the script with its pierced venomous heart co-written by Robert Alan Aurthur, with Fosse choreographing the film himself. By the time Scheider is zipped up in a body bag at the movie’s end, having imagined the show of his own life in his head in his dying moments, it’s impossible not to feel winded by the experience of a wildly self-important spectacle that’s every inch as grand a portrait of an artist as “8 1/2,” “Andrei Rublev,” or “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.” “All That Jazz” is also the rare example of a movie musical that goes deeper than it could have on the stage, with Fosse utilizing the medium — at the height of his powers — with the reckless abandon of someone discovering it for the first time. It’s a movie that reflects all of the genius and unalloyed vision that had defined the previous decade in American film. And when Joe Gideon died, the ’70s died with him. —RL By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Good morning. Many of their colleagues were downsizing and preparing for their "empty nest" years. But one couple in their mid-40s moved in the opposite direction: they bought a bigger house. They don't always use the space, the cleaning is endless, and the bills are higher. A decade later, they're convinced they made the right decision. In today's big story, we all face an AI-supercharged job market. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, while hiring managers revealed how they're adapting to identify real talent. What's on deck: Markets: Are you struggling as a day trader? This psychologist might know why. Tech: It's not just Big Tech that's clamoring after AI engineers. Everyone wants to date them. Business: Like their customers, millennial-coded brands are facing the cold, hard reality of aging. But first, hand-delivered is hard to ignore. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Perhaps you did everything right. You spent hours researching the company. Hours more rewriting your résumé. The cover letter? Polished, professional, and personal. You click "submit." And wait. The days spin into weeks. The inbox never dings. You're not alone. White-collar hiring has slowed, layoffs feel de rigueur, and many who do have jobs are clinging onto them — whether they're happy or not. "My dream job might exist," a frustrated Gen Z job seeker told BI. "But I'm one of 400 people applying for it." The issue cuts both ways. For hiring managers, their dream employee might also exist. But amid a crowd of AI-generated applications, they may never find them. BI spoke with people on either side of the hiring divide. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, and employers revealed their strategies for spotting real talent. They're going old school. Job seekers are getting creative, with some finding success going back to basics: handing in a paper résumé in person. Businesses are adapting, too. With AI tools now helping with résumés, cover letters, and even live interviews, measuring a candidate's suitability for a role can be challenging. Is this the person we want to hire — or just the AI that coached them? Victoria Thomas, the chief business officer of a Porsche customization and racing company, said AI-crafted résumés can make candidates seem more qualified than they really are. To combat this, her team flies candidates to their Wisconsin office for in-person interviews and tryouts. The workplace is changing — and so are the rules for job searching. BI has tapped HR managers, recruiters, career coaches, and executives for their best advice on everything from crafting a standout résumé to networking your way to a final offer. So, before you send off that job application, you can find everything you need to gain an edge here. 1. Meet the 16-year-old prodigy at Citadel Securities. Kairan Quazi, a quant developer at the New York trading giant, caught the world's attention when he landed a job at SpaceX at age 14. He told BI why he switched from Big Tech to quant finance. 2. What makes (and breaks) a day trader? Andrew Menaker, a psychologist who coaches traders on and off Wall Street, has an answer. He said ego and aggression are traits that lead traders astray, and shared tips for those trying to get in on the trade. 3. Where to invest if the market goes south. If you're holding cash right now, it's a good idea to have a strategy for buying the dip in case a bear market hits. Two rules of thumb: Don't enter the market all at once, and don't panic. Here's where experts suggest investing. 1. In Silicon Valley, the ladies want a tech nerd. Professional matchmakers in the Bay Area — whose fees range from $5,900 to $500,000 — told BI more women are looking for AI engineers, thanks to their high salaries and job stability. It's not clear how long interest will last, but for now, the AI boom is making nerds sexy. 2. The startup turning Elon Musk's DOGE-fueled chaos into cash. Legalist, a startup founded by one of Peter Thiel's fellows, provides gap financing for vendors awaiting payouts from the federal government. Here's how they cashed in on the havoc DOGE wrecked. 3. How these Gen Zers beat the odds to score roles in tech. The industry is hemorrhaging entry-level jobs thanks to AI and corporate cost-cutting. Young workers told BI how they scored roles after casting a wide net or networking around the clock. 1. Millennial brands hit middle age. Glossier is at Sephora. Mideas are having holes drilled in them. What once seemed like an industry adjustment toward direct, values-centered relationships with consumers has been exposed as a marketing ploy — and today, these brands are either dying or becoming boring companies, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. 2. Spotify's ad business is laggy. Advertising made up 11% of its business in June, a far cry from its 20% target. "We have simply been moving too slowly," CEO Daniel Ek said on the company's latest earnings call. Industry insiders said poor customer service and low podcast ad rates were also factors. 3. The AT&T CEO's blunt memo is a test case for leaders. Since BI was the first to report on AT&T CEO John Stankey's viral memo to managers, hundreds of readers, including leaders, have weighed in. BI spoke to current and former CEOs for their thoughts on the memo. Three tips for employees to manage their wellbeing in a challenging job environment, from EY's Chief Wellbeing Officer.

Why Evolution Is True Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. Another damn work week is on tap: it’s Monday, August 18, 2025 and also National Bad Poetry Day. For a collection of the absolute worst bad poetry, get this book. It’s hilarious (click for Amazon link): And then read some poems by the very WORST BAD POET IN HISTORY, William McGonagall. Here’s one of his more famous poems, “The Tay Bridge Disaster.”, about a railroad bridge in Scotland that collapsed with a train on it, killing many. The last verse: It’s also Cupcake Day (in Australia), National Fajita Day, Helium Discovery Day (it was “discovered” on this day in 1868 by Pierre Jules César Janssen), National Ice Cream Pie Day, and Pinot Noir Day. Wikipedia says this about helium: the “discoverer” is different from “the detector.” Anyway, it’s complicated: Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig, Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel, and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. However, only Lockyer proposed that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today. Here is some helium: Readers are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the August 18 Wikipedia page. Da Nooz: *Today European leaders, along with Ukraine’s President Zelensky, will meet with Trump in Washington about the Russian/Ukraine war. As you know, Europe is much more favorably disposed to Ukraine than is Trump, who seems will to almost give the country away so he can get his Nobel Peace Prize. From the NYT: European leaders said on Sunday that they would join President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine when he meets with President Trump on Monday at the White House, as they strive to present a united front against Russia and avoid being sidelined in peace talks. The presence of at least six European heads of state — including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, two of Mr. Trump’s favored counterparts — highlights the continent’s effort to smooth relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, whose last White House meeting in February descended into a public clash. European leaders have spent months cultivating ties with Mr. Trump to strengthen their hand in pressing Ukraine’s case, while also coaching Mr. Zelensky on how to better engage with Mr. Trump. On Sunday, the Europeans met online and in person with Mr. Zelensky to prepare for the meeting in Washington. “We’ll give a few good pieces of advice,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany told the German television broadcaster ZDF ahead of the meeting. . . .Mr. Trump will first meet with Mr. Zelensky. The two leaders are then scheduled to join a working lunch and a larger meeting with all the European leaders, according to European officials familiar with the preparations for the White House meeting. The meeting will come three days after talks in Alaska between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ended inconclusively but fueled concerns in Europe that Mr. Trump’s thinking may have tilted toward Russia’s position. On Saturday, after his summit with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump sided with the Russian president in calling for a direct peace agreement that would be likely to see Ukraine cede unconquered territory to Russia, rather than securing a cease-fire first. Negotiations toward a peace agreement rather than an immediate cease-fire would give Russia time to continue exploiting its advantage on the battlefield to seize territory before front lines are settled in any deal. Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Zelensky and European leaders had agreed on the point. But earlier in the week, the group had called for refusing to discuss peace terms until a cease-fire was in place. Although much of Europe is wrong in trying to recognize Palestine in search of a “two state solution,” here they are right. Trump, who promised to end the war in Ukraine on Day 1, now says he didn’t really mean it (duh!). And under his plan, what does Ukraine get out of a deal save the end of its citizens being killed? Will Russia give it back Crimea? Don’t hold your breath. Nor will Ukraine get to keep what border Russian territory it’s now occupying. This is not a compromise, but a bullying of Ukraine to bow to Trump. Fortunately, Zelensky is not an invertebrate, and Europe may be able to apply pressure to Russia to effect some compromise. But for me, from the beginning of this war the only “good” outcome was for Russia to lose and pull back into its own territory. After it, it invaded a sovereign nature without good cause, just like Hitler with Austria and Czechoslovakia. Russia is now insisting that it should keep all the Ukrainian territory it has taken over, and will take over until there is a peace agreement. *California governor Gavin Newsom has promised to retaliate against Texas’s redistricting to do his own redistricting that would counterbalance five new Republican seats in Congress with five new Democratic seats in Congress from California. I don’t like either of these moves, though if you aren’t American you might find them amusing. But a WSJ op-ed warns of a greater danger to us Democrats than this tit-for-tat gerrymandering: people are moving to red states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is promising a referendum in November to gerrymander five more Democratic House seats on top of the 43 of 52 they already have in the state. Even if it works, his victory may be short-lived. The real problem for Democrats is that progressive policies are driving population flight, which on current trend could cost their states 10 House seats after 2030. Migration from blue to red states is one of the great stories of the age. It accelerated during the Covid lockdowns as Americans fled states with high taxes and living costs—and disorderly streets and lousy schools. Sayonara, San Francisco. Hello, Salt Lake City. Start with the raw numbers. Between 2020 and 2024, California (-1,465,116), New York (-966,209) and Illinois (-418,056) lost the population equivalent of Kansas to other states. Texas (747,730) and Florida (872,722) gained the equivalent of West Virginia. Utah, Idaho, Arizona and North Carolina also experienced a rush of newcomers. Births and foreign migration have somewhat lessened the population losses in Democratic-run states. But their populations are nonetheless aging as young people and families leave. Between 2020 and 2024, California’s population under the age of 18 shrank by 523,000, while New York’s fell by 250,000 and Illinois’s by 186,000. School closures during the pandemic no doubt contributed to their loss of children, but maybe parents also don’t want their children learning about the varieties of sexual experience in third-grade or being taught that America was founded to preserve slavery. Just a thought. Texas gained 199,000 children and Florida 219,000 in the same period. While slowing immigration under President Trump will dampen population growth in some Republican-led states like Texas and Florida, it will steepen losses in many Democratic states. Notable, though, is that many immigrants who initially come to New York, California and Illinois later leave for other states—for the same reasons native citizens do. Only about one-third of immigrants who came to California between 2010 and 2023 on net stayed in the state. Immigrants who arrive in Florida and Texas are more likely to settle there. California’s foreign-born population increased by about 600,000 between 2010 and 2023, versus roughly 1.5 million for both Florida and Texas. Despite their policy failures, Democrats have used gerrymanders to entrench their power in statehouses in California, New York, Illinois, Maryland and elsewhere. Population flight cost Democratic states several House seats during the last Congressional reapportionment following the 2020 Census, but they lost fewer seats than expected. That’s partly because Covid lockdowns increased the risk of miscounting college students and people with second homes. Perhaps Floridians with pied-à-terres in Manhattan were counted as New Yorkers. The Census Bureau in 2022 reported that New York’s population was over-counted by 3.4% while there were under-counts in Florida (3.5%) and Texas (1.9%). Such inaccuracies may have cost Florida and Texas an additional House seat and given Rhode Island, New York and Minnesota one each they shouldn’t have received. Tough for GOP Speaker Mike Johnson. But if population trends continue, Republican states stand to gain at least 10 House seats in the 2030 reapportionment. The left-leaning Brennan Center estimated in December that Texas and Florida would each gain four House seats while Utah, Idaho, North Carolina and Arizona would each add one. California would lose four, New York two, and Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island one each. Yes, but what this article forgets is the midterm “bounce” that favors the Democrats. It’s possible—indeed, likely, that disaffected Republicans may stay home during the midterms, or would vote Democratic because of Trump’s tariffs and the rising cost of living (they are connected, of course). I myself would be unwilling to bet which party would hold a majority of the House of Representatives after the midterms. *Perhaps in response to those misguided souls who criticized “our” book (i.e., a collection of essays edited by Lawrence Krauss for playing into the hands of Trump by criticizing the Left’s attack on science —didn’t you know that the Right is the real Destroyer of Science?), Krauss has written a piece in Reason magazine called “America’s two-front war on science” (subtitle: “Universities’ internal culture wars threaten free speech and inquiry, but political attacks on research funding and infrastructure are crippling U.S. scientific leadership”). There is currently a two-pronged attack on higher education, research, and scholarship in the United States. Activists inside universities have hijacked many administrative functions, and significant reform is needed to ensure free speech, open inquiry, and the integrity of scholarship. But the Trump administration has used this fact to launch what may be a more dangerous direct attack on university scientific and research infrastructures across the nation. We can’t afford to lose either war if we are to protect the country’s scientific integrity and productivity. Harvard University epitomizes the quandary we now find ourselves in. Over the last decade, it succumbed to much of the modern culture war in ways that have threatened faculty and students, and even prospective students. Students and researchers have alleged that Harvard has discriminated against Asian applicants, rigorously policed speech, and punished faculty whose research results didn’t match preconceived notions about racism or who stated that there are only two sexes, while allowing antisemitic conduct. In addition, the university promoted staff based on identity rather than academic accomplishments, including those known to have plagiarized academic work, while discriminating against talented students and scholars on the grounds of their race or sex. Harvard is by no means unique. Bloated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bureaucracies have taken root at academic institutions around the country. The University of California at Berkeley biology department, for example, in 2019, disqualified 76 percent of the applicants for a faculty position based solely on their DEI statements—before examining their research . . .Prestigious scientific journals, such as Nature Human Behaviour, have indicated they will not publish scientific articles if they could cause offense or a sense of harm to certain groups. Physical Review, a major journal in my own field of physics, went so far as to publish a case study positing that the use of whiteboards in classrooms could be viewed as a remnant of white supremacy. The situation has set back scientific and scholarly progress, and has undermined the credibility of many academic disciplines among the public. At the same time, President Donald Trump has not only launched a frontal assault on Harvard but has also removed leading scientists from national advisory boards and federally supported research institutions, and declared war on universities and departments that don’t bow to his political agenda. Perhaps most damaging of all, this administration is proposing to end support for most cutting-edge American research programs. This includes cutting the National Science Foundation budget by almost 60 percent, and killing major projects—from closing half of the Nobel Prize-winning Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, to ending U.S. participation in the next generation space-based detector, to considering closing the NASA-Goddard space center, where most of the science at NASA originates. The administration’s attempts to paint all university faculty as woke are misguided. Many leading scientists and scholars have continued to push the boundaries of knowledge while either ignoring ongoing culture wars or avoiding administrative activists on their campuses. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is never a good idea, nor is schadenfreude worth risking the future of knowledge. The proper way to fight one form of intolerance is not to impose your own brand of intolerance. But of course nobody who has gone after the book (or Lawrence) on the grounds of mostly criticizing Leftist attacks on science will pay any attention to this. This claim that we can’t criticize the Left’s attack on science because it plays into the hands of Trump reminds me of those idiots people who said I should not criticize Kamala Harris until after she won the election because otherwise I’d be supporting Trump. (Of course I spent plenty of time criticizing Trump, too.) And of course I didn’t vote for Trump. Further, those criticisms ignore the possibility that the wokeness of the left, even in science (e.g., declarations that “trans women are women” and the like) also played into the hands of Trump, who spent more money on that one issue that on any other issue in the election. Our job is to criticize people as we see them, and not to ignore only the transgressions on “our side” because it makes us look bad and could make us lose. I’ve explained many times when I see my brief as purifying my own end of the political spectrum, or at least calling it out, since everybody in the MSM is already going after Trump and his administration. *If you’ve ever been to Yosemite National Park in California, you’ll know that (despite the crowds in some places) it’s one of the most beautiful places in America. Yet, as reader Rachel Dec writes at The Free Press, the park is getting “quietly gutted” due to Trump’s budget cuts. (The article was originally published at The Dispatch.) It’s very sad: You’re stuck in a snaking line of cars in 80-degree heat, tour buses idling behind minivans. The scent of pine still cuts through the fumes. The websites warned of hours-long queues, but miraculously your car’s tires roll past Yosemite’s entrance gate in less than 25 minutes. “Very quick for a summer Saturday,” a ranger jokes as he hands you a map. “You should have seen it last weekend.” After a half-hour descent into the valley, you can finally get out. High above, the granite cliffs are so tall they don’t fit in your iPhone’s viewfinder. Among the network of tall pines, you’ve never been so small. That’s Yosemite for you. Home to more than 400 species of animals, 1,500 species of plants, and roughly 4 million annual visitors, the park has stood, since President Abraham Lincoln first preserved it, as a radical idea: that some landscapes are too magnificent to belong to private individuals, and instead should be given to the nation. Today, this legacy is at risk. Over the past six months, permanent staff at the National Park Service (NPS)—which is the agency that governs the park—have been cut by 24 percent. It’s the result of layoffs, buyouts, and a hiring freeze from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This year, of the 8,000 seasonal positions allotted by President Donald Trump’s budget, barely 4,500 were filled by July. At the same time, the government has moved aggressively to open more public land to mining, logging, and energy extraction. . . .On a desperately hot July Saturday, I came to Yosemite to see how these pressures were reshaping the park. Out on the trail, tourists could be heard grumbling about the four-hour queues at the park’s southern entrances, but few noticed the creeping overgrowth of invasive Himalayan blackberry along the trails. But there are a few tangible signs of decline: a sold-out bike rental shop, overflowing trash cans, volunteers answering basic questions outside the visitor center because of the long lines to speak to the rangers inside. Recent online reviews of the park’s campsites complain of “dilapidated bathrooms without soap or paper” and “pitiful” conditions. Artifacts relating to the park’s natural history were recently stolen as a result of low staffing, forcing every building in its Pioneer History Center to temporarily close. Speak to workers, and the prognosis is alarming. In Yosemite, there is growing unease that a diminished ranger corps will struggle to manage not just the impact on wildlife, but on people. The park averages around 200 search and rescue operations per year, and many warn these lifesaving missions will soon be dangerously understaffed, and therefore slower and less effective. While emergency medical workers are technically exempt from the Trump administration’s funding cuts, staff from other divisions are generally brought in to support large emergencies—so falling head counts elsewhere will have spillover effects. If I didn’t know that Trump won’t be President after January, 2029 (and if you think he will win a third term, email me and I’ll bet you otherwise), I’d say we should be campaigning against his re-election. (I’m not at all sure now that J. D. Vance will succeed him, though I used to be pretty sure.) When foreigners planning to come to America and ask me where they should go, I always tell them to the National Parks in California: Sequoia, Yosemite, Death Valley, and then up the White Mountains to see the bristlecones and then north of San Francisco to see the tall redwoods. If Trump ruins these glories (logging, my tuches!), well, I don’t know what I can do except chain myself to a tree (which doesn’t work). *A library book has been returned after the death of its borrower—82 years after it was taken out. Fortunately, there were no overdue fines. But that’s not even close to the record for overdue books! A library book has been returned nearly 82 years after it was borrowed from the San Antonio Public Library. It came with a letter noting that “Grandma won’t be able to pay for it anymore.” The book is “Your Child, His Family, and Friends” by marriage and family counselor Frances Bruce Strain. It was checked out in July 1943 and returned this past June from a person in Oregon, the library said in a news release. “After the recent death of my father, I inherited a few boxes of books he left behind,” the person wrote in a letter that was shared by the library on Instagram and signed with the initials P.A.A.G. The book was a guide for parents on helping their children navigate personal relationships. It was checked out when the person’s father was 11 years old. “The book must have been borrowed by my Grandmother, Maria del Socorro Aldrete Flores (Cortez),” the person wrote. “In that year, she transferred to Mexico City to work at the US Embassy. She must have taken the book with her, and some 82 years later, it ended up in my possession.” . . .The library said in a news release that it eliminated overdue fines in 2021. The inside cover of the book was stamped with the warning that the fine for overdue books was three cents a day. Not accounting for inflation, the penalty would amount to nearly $900. Three cents in July 1943 amounts to 56 cents in today’s money, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Inflation Calculator. That would add up to more than $16,000. The library noted that the book is in “good condition.” It’ll be on display in the city’s central library through August. It will then be donated to the Friends of San Antonio Public Library and sold to benefit the library. Eight decades may seem like a long time for an overdue library book, but it’s nowhere near the record. Guinness World Records says the most overdue library book was returned to Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge, England, in 1956. It was borrowed in 1668, some 288 years earlier. No fine was extracted. Meanwhile in Dobrzyn, Andrzej calms Hili down: Hili: Everything’s becoming more tangled. Andrzej: Yes, but it’s something we’ve seen before.

I was lucky enough to see her perform when she was in her prime. I suspect the Lavrov “photo” shown by Masih is a fake, though it does seem to attempt to portray something that he actually wore. It was reported in Foreign Policy journal on 8/15. (and elsewhere) It is real. Real for sure. Lavrov, when not consorting with lithe little hookers on his friends’ yachts in Turkey, is a dedicated troll. Having the meeting in Alaska is funny – given they sold it to us once (for something like twenty bucks. hahahaha). Talk about the worst real estate deal of all time. D.A. NYC The photo posted by Masih is clearly fake, as the sweatshirt seen there does not match the sweatshirt seen in the legitimate press coverage. Compare, e.g. the double stripe on the collar in the fake photo vis-à-vis that in the legit coverage. And in none of the legit press footage does one see all four of the letters CCCP, only the middle two or so. Yes, the image of Lavrov in Masih’s tweet shows clear signs of having been AI-generated. In addition to the differences from the press photos that Jared points out, which prove the point, there are a number of other giveaways: the overall honey-tinged sepia tone (which this image has in common with all those AI going-out-of-business ads for fake mom-and-pop leathercrafter and shoemaker shops), the undersized proportions of the upper arms, the schematic fall of the folds in the sleeves, and the just-so placement of the video camera in the background. So while the spotting of Lavrov with a presumed CCCP sweatshirt appears to be real, this specific image tweeted by Masih and others seems to be an AI fabrication. A “CCCP” anecdote. When I first noticed it (over 60 yers ago) I thought it stood for the Central Committee of the Communist Party, definitely not for the Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik. Live and learn. I must admit that I do not know or understand the difference between good and bad poetry (please do not yell at me for this). I can appreciate soaring prose. As I have written in this space in the past, I, unlike Jerry, did not take full advantage of the liberal arts education offered me in college. I know the Tay bridge disaster as do all engineers as an engineering failure as it is cited by the late civil engineer and engineering historian Henry Petroski in his books “To Engineer Is Human” and “Pushing the Limits”. That is, I can distinguish between good and bad engineering design, but I really cannot distinguish between good and bad poetry. We have seen this movie regarding underfunding of the National Parks numerous times unfortunately. It derives from those of our citizens who, at their extreme, believe that the only purpose of a federal government and thus its funding with citizens’ tax dollars is to protect us from foreign invasion. No vaccinations to protect against epidemics, no support of the arts, no support of basic science research, and no support for national parks as refuge and inspiration for all citizens. I was fortunate years ago to spend several weeks backpacking through Yosemite by entering from the Stanislaus forest to the North along the Pacific Crest Trail. Never saw a road or a building. The landscape was spectacular! When I come across verse in a book I’m reading, I get a bit annoyed that the writer is making me do a bunch of extra work. I had an excellent liberal education (I think), but reading poetry is so much work! Just say what you mean and don’t make it a puzzle that I have to struggle to figure out.* *I had a good liberal education (I think), but not all of it took. I concur with your observation, particularly when the verse is in another language. (Another AI™ collaboration): I think that I shall never see A form of words like poetry. It gives us voice to share our hearts, A way to speak when silence starts. In every line, a truth can shine, A gift of thought, both yours and mine. (FWIW, the AI™ eventually came up with almost all the words, but despite several promptings never got the scansion right for the second line. Sort of the poetry equivalent of flubbing 2+2+2+2 = 8. But it does appear very good at faking sincerity.) You should try reading Vogon poetry. Why bother? I write it. HAHAHAHAHAHA! I’m with you there, Jim. It’s courageous of you to admit it first. Stephen Leacock, Canada’s foremost humorist of the early 20th century (before all our literary output got decolonized and indigenized — at least now there are objective criteria for judging merit) once observed that while persons of his acquaintance were never shy to admit they had no critical sense of music, and were even proud to confess they couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket, every single one would wax indignant if he suggested to them that they probably had no sense of humour, either, since the two were typically correlated in his experience. I suspect the same is true of poetry. I do have to give props to Mr. McGonagall’s effort in (sort-of) rhyming “buttresses” with “confesses”. This is called a feminine rhyme, as opposed to the more common masculine rhyme where the very last syllable in the line rhymes with the very last syllable in the line of the scheme. This restricts the poet to one-syllable words at the ends of rhyming lines, or to words (often foreign) with the accent on the last syllable. Working in a feminine rhyme is a nice touch. A better example herewith: A swashbuckling pirate named Gates Did dance the fandango on skates. Till he tripped on his cutlass Which rendered him nutless And practically useless on dates. If you like it it’s good. Same thing with wine and food. I looked up the authors & poems listed in the Contents for the poetry book and was disappointed to note the lack of Dawn Watson’s enigmatic, “Bird on the School Path.” Ok, so maybe it doesn’t descend to the depths of ‘worst’, but it is certainly inscrutable. Or something. And then there’s Bad Cinema. I like Bird on the School Path! Or, at least, it made me laugh. The poem instantly evokes the image of this common behavior on the part of birds – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFWq5T_ROsg – – which, if you didn’t know better, really does look as if the birds are going “WTF is with all these leaves?” That said, I agree that it’s not exactly on a par with The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock or The Second Coming PCC(E) : “Here is some helium:” Am I the only one who read that in a high-pitched voice? 😃 “Here is some helium.” I even clicked on the image just to be sure I wasn’t missing something. More coffee… The Islamic Paris Barbie thing is a worrying trend in many places. Surrendering to Islamic intolerance is a deeply concerning recent development. Re criticisms of the left. I am similarly situated politically as PCC(E) and I also spend more of my time in my column, on X, and general loudmouth duties (I am a busy fellow) …criticizing leftist idiocy. There’s no shortage of GoP and right wing idiocy but I regard it as so self beclowning as to be hardly worth my time. And indeed, done well enough by the MSM. Like… parents spend more time disciplining their OWN children rather than the kids of the idiots next door. 🙂 Glad JKR is not in favor of Scottish independence (though my Scottish grandma would roll in her grave…) as it is wholly a bad idea. D.A. NYC @DavidandersonJd https://themoderatevoice.com/author/david-anderson/ (see? Loudmouth!) Thank you for bringing Prof Krauss’ Reason article to our attention. This is not an either/or issue but rather both. The ideological left has been hollowing out university science research AND now the right is zeroing it out. Even if full funding were restored today, the unis have some serious housekeeping to do as has been pointed out both on this site and in Prof Krauss’ excellent “The War on Science” compendium. I do think, as an outsider to today’s university, that while we are fixing funding issues and the telos of the university, we also have to ask about balance of good teaching and research. Is the sole purpose of the university to produce knowledge, or rather has it a dual purpose in producing knowledge and the next generation of educated citizens, some of whom will carry on with producing the next generation of knowledge? What is a proper teaching load for faculty? How many deans, assistant deans, associate deans, etc does it take to administer a department? There is a four-minute video of a (recently) late friend of Jerry’s and mine, former chair of the econ dept at William and Mary, Prof Will Haussman, speaking in part, in 2010 about this dual requirement at url Let me try a model using the Gordian knot story (lo-tech flowchart style ): Woke Left radical power creates Gordian knots | V Power shift away from Left … somehow… | V Woke Right radical power cleaves Gordian knots | V Left assumes power by outrage over the Right | V Repeat from top … these are the two ends of the political horseshoe model that’s out there. What goes hidden is the wokeness of the Right. If the new book (The War On Science, Krauss, ed.) can get the radical Left demarcated from the non-radical Left, that will be a major achievement. I was recalling the politicization of stem cell research (remember?), and rethinking it in light of radical activism. I think there’s something to it. Amen Brother. It’s telling that common academic parlance refers to “research opportunities” and “teaching loads”. Excellent picture of Helium! What type of camera did you use? Himalayan Blackberry in Yosemite? That stuff will take over the entire park in short order if it isn’t killed. (Around here in the Pacific Northwest, people advertise that they will “Kill Blackberry Permanently.” Yes, not temporarily dead, permanently dead.) Our roadsides are covered with this stuff. The tough seeds get caught in vehicle tire treads and get spread along every roadway, creating impenetrable walls of brambles. The Himalayan Blackberry prickers are super sharp and robust, making them even worse. The blackberries are delicious, their only grace. And, of course, there’s the rest of the news. We’ll see what happens with Ukraine. I hope that Zelensky and Trump can be civil with each other for long enough to meet with European leaders later in the day. That’ll be the first test. Yes, Trump wants to win a Nobel prize, but there is a more charitable interpretation of his actions. He may be pushing for an end to the war simply because he deplores the loss of life—even if that leads Ukraine to have to cede some territory. He does talk a lot about “stopping the killing,” so maybe he actually believes it. Today’s meetings will be interesting and perhaps even consequential. I’m with you all the way re Himalayan Blackberry and its evil twin, Evergreen/European Blackberry (I bet they hybridize). I have a 30-year struggle with them in our coast Range property. I’m winning, but they will always be there. They must be dug out by the roots and replaced by robust trees and shrubs. Now then how about Japanese (aka giant) Knotweed? An equally pernicious foe, praised by empty-headed herbalists as it crowds out everything. National Bad Poetry Day: Well I’m a native of the very city, Dundee, that William Topaz McGonagall scrieved his extraordinarily excruciatingly bad verse. Indeed an old artist friend of mine lived just two doors up from McGonagall’s old residence in Step Row. Directly across the Perth Road from my old alma mater in the 1990s, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, was the haunt of us art students, an excellent pub called McGonagall’s where you could enjoy a pint or four of superb ales whilst perusing framed examples of Mr Topaz McGonagall’s truly jaw droppingly appalling “poetry”…unfortunately the pub changed management years back and lost that uniquely entertaining character. On yesterday’s Gaza colleague loss: I’ll read all the comments later, but just to say I’ve lost two lifelong friends over this. Weirdly, neither knew pretty much anything about the issue more than what they’ve seen on PBS and the Aust.B.C. respectively. So basically Hamas propaganda. So it is a loss, for sure. Not as serious as me abandoning truth and morality however. I won’t do that. And the trans scandal has actually cost me MORE people. hahah So a more lonely few years. ‘ef ’em. Writer, unwoke Lionel Shriver asserts that it is mostly the more leftist party leaving a friendship in these kinds of clashes and in my experience she is correct. D.A. NYC re: Gaza. Leslie’s two pieces about the ballistics and dynamics of rocketry there is totally accurate. And his discussion of Dresden, WW2. So. I’m yet to be persuaded, after studying this since I was a teenager and my degree in the topic, extensive travels and study of the Arabic language, my published articles, etc. (I’m not an expert but rather a well informed person) that there are ANY civilians in Gaza beyond infants. We constantly try to place the conflict within our cultural lens. Big mistake. “Palestine” is sui-generis – there is no country like it. Not only is it ENTIRELY Islamic – hard Islam – which has the specific antisemitism built in via the Koran (I can provide letter and verse if you wish)… but the entire NOTION of a Pal State, its moral and philosophical architecture is towards one single unifying goal: The destruction of the State of Israel. This dynamic exists nowhere else on earth – lots of people hate their neighbors, some attack and invade, or they covet their stuff, don’t like their ideology, etc. but NONE have their founding charters (ALL OF THEM) and almost entire public belief… demanding the extinction of another country. And precious little else! Beyond Sharia. The above are the “missing pieces” as well as the primacy of Islam.. which we’re not weighing into our analysis. We shouldn’t treat this conflict which is unlike any other, as if it is. D.A. https://x.com/DavidandersonJd “I’m yet to be persuaded … that there are ANY civilians in Gaza beyond infants.” A trenchant comment by my druthers! I know that I have brought this up before, but it seems to me to be a point worth repeating as I seem to be the only person talking about it. One of the first things the IDF reported after their initial entry into Gaza, was that every other (!) domicile contained a hidden munitions cache, usually under a child’s crib or bed. We are talking about machine guns, ammo, grenades, etc. All the things one would need to eliminate Hamas’ so-called “soldiers” if one wanted to. So why have they not done so? Why? I can not come to any other conclusion other than – they do not want to. Aside from preschoolers, they have been inculcated their entire lives to hate Jews, and trained how to murder Jews for the glory of Allah. They have been taught, many in UN schools, that Israel is their rightful territory, and that martyrdom is the truest good and path to glory. Multiple MEMRI videos attest to this. Multiple polling attests to this. Multiple on-the-street interviews with Gazans YouTube videos attest to this. Multiple interviews with former Gazans and Hamas operatives confirm that the vast majority of Gazans believe this. Someone, anybody – please tell me another way how to explain this video made 9 years ago (possibly in Judea/Samaria not even in Gaza?) of a Palestinian father urging IDF soldiers to shoot his young Palestinian flag-bearing son for the camera?: I, for one, believe David Anderson has hit the nail on the head. Try this link to see video: There is no homosexuality in the Barbie movie, but there are openly gay actors playing parts, and one character in the movie was interpreted as being possibly gay. According to Google AI: “While the Barbie movie doesn’t explicitly feature any textually gay characters, some viewers interpret certain characters, particularly Allan, as having strong queer coding. Allan, played by Michael Cera, is often seen as a queer icon due to his outsider status, distinct fashion sense (a rainbow-striped crocheted shirt), and his role as an awkward, non-conforming character in a world dominated by Barbies and Kens. Additionally, the movie features several openly LGBTQ+ actors in various roles, including Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and Scott Evans. ” Anyway, I liked the movie but it takes a lot of suspension of belief. The last line in the movie made me lol. I watched the entire movie and it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Still, Ryan Reynolds (?) the dude playing Ken, did not deserve an Oscar nomination. Kate McKinnon was hilarious as always. What angered me was a trans-identifying male playing a Barbie. Why the director/casting agents thought that anyone would think he is a woman is beyond me. “the use of whiteboards in classrooms could be viewed as a remnant of white supremacy” – does that mean we should go back to using blackboards? Certainly. And with white chalk as the active principle. But B boards are so empty, and they are frequently erased. Before W boards were a thing I took a corporate course where they had boards textured like a B board, but white. Instead of markers they used coloured (oops?) chalk, usually blue. My main recollection is that the chalk dust visibly got on everything, particularly clothing. Your email address will not be published.

August 18, 2025 07:15 ET | Source: Serve Robotics Inc. Serve Robotics Inc. SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Serve Robotics Inc. (Nasdaq: SERV), a leading autonomous sidewalk delivery company (“Serve”), has acquired Vayu Robotics, Inc. (“Vayu”), a pioneer in urban robot navigation using large-scale AI models. The strategic acquisition marks a milestone in Serve’s mission to redefine the future of autonomous delivery. As “physical AI” gains unprecedented momentum, acquiring Vayu positions Serve at the forefront of this paradigm shift in the robotics industry. Serve’s delivery robots have set the industry benchmark for last-mile autonomy performance, successfully navigating complex, dynamic environments in urban settings. By combining Serve’s autonomy stack and unrivalled real‑world sidewalk dataset with Vayu’s expertise in AI foundation models and its scalable simulation-powered data engine, Serve is positioned to train more capable models through the fusion of real and simulated data — unlocking safer, faster, and more generalizable navigation while accelerating entry into new geographies and use cases. The combination of Serve and Vayu is expected to: Vayu’s multidisciplinary team of exceptional engineers from top-tier institutions, pedigreed researchers, and seasoned business leaders join Serve with decades of experience in developing and commercializing advanced technologies across autonomous vehicles and robotics. Vayu’s founders Anand Gopalan, Mahesh Krishnamurthi and Nitish Srivastava bring unique perspectives shaped by their deep expertise in AI and machine learning, hardware systems, and large-scale production. In addition, legendary Silicon Valley technologist and Vayu’s lead investor Vinod Khosla will join Serve’s Advisory Board to support its mission of bringing robots to cities across the world. “With this acquisition, Serve solidifies its leadership position, not just in current robotic delivery operations, but in shaping the future of autonomous robotic navigation. This step marks a significant milestone in Serve’s roadmap toward wide-scale deployment of autonomous robots on sidewalks across the nation, aligning with industry predictions of rapid robot adoption,” said Dr. Ali Kashani, CEO and co-founder of Serve Robotics. “Autonomy is critical to our long-term goal of bringing delivery costs down to $1, and these new capabilities will help us move faster.” “We are thrilled to join the Serve team and apply our AI foundation model technology, talent and expertise to accelerating the development of their autonomous delivery platform,” said Anand Gopalan, CEO of Vayu Robotics. “Serve is differentiated by unmatched operational depth, a proven ability to deploy robots at scale, and a relentless focus on driving down cost per delivery through autonomy. Combined with a strong balance sheet and a bold, clear-eyed vision, Serve is uniquely positioned to lead the future of last-mile logistics. We’re proud and excited to be building that future together.” “AI models are driving a new class of robotics across a range of industries,” said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures. “We invested early in Vayu because last-mile delivery stood out as one of the applications where autonomous delivery robots could create immense value. Today’s acquisition combines Vayu’s technological breakthroughs with Serve’s large footprint to accelerate faster, safer and more cost effective delivery.” Financial Consideration The acquisition was completed for upfront initial consideration payable to Vayu stockholders of 1,696,069 shares of Serve’s common stock (“Common Stock”), subject to customary purchase price adjustments and including vested, in-the-money options. An additional future earnout of 560,000 shares of Common Stock may be payable to Vayu stockholders and Vayu debtholders, contingent on achieving certain autonomy performance milestones. Additionally, the acquisition consideration included warrants to purchase 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $10.36 per share, issued to the Vayu SAFE holder, Khosla Ventures. Some Vayu stockholders may also receive cash in lieu of shares. The transaction includes customary representations and warranties of the parties and an escrow to cover any indemnifiable expenses or liabilities. The stock consideration received in the transaction is subject to a 180-day lockup and the warrant consideration received in the transaction is subject to a four-year lockup. Following the acquisition, Serve will continue to have a strong balance sheet and expects to continue to have access to sufficient capital.

Oracle has cut over 300 roles in the US When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings have confirmed Oracle has laid off over 300 workers in Washington and California. The redundancies consist of 143 workers in Redwood City, California and a further 161 in Seattle, Washington, however further layoffs could also be taking place that are not covered by WARN filings. A worker familiar with the matter told The Register the figures sound low, suggesting remote workers might not be accounted for – a way of obscuring the scale of layoffs that Microsoft has also been accused of. "It feels like that happened here too, the reported numbers don't quite match up with what my network is saying," the worker said. "My estimate would be low thousands worldwide... Supposedly this is just the start, too," they added. Compared with other giants in this space, Oracle's reaction to economic uncertainties has been pretty reserved. Around 200 workers left in 2022, with some more leaving in separate sittings since then. Compared with the tens of thousands who have lost their jobs at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Oracle workers have therefore been pretty safe. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Looking ahead, The Register's source suggests thousands could lose their jobs worldwide with offices being closed and large cuts in India (around 10% of its local workforce). Artificial intelligence has been blamed for ongoing tech layoffs, but instead of AI taking human jobs, companies are having to allocate more capital towards AI data center expansions, effectively cutting their staffing budgets. In June, Oracle confirmed a revenue increase for fiscal 2025 of 8%. "Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26," CEO Safra Catz noted. TechRadar Pro has asked Oracle to share further context about its recent layoffs. Any update will be posted here.

Title: Pop culture and politics are intertwined in the age of Trump. Just look at the Paramount-Skydance merger

Time Published: 2025-08-18T09:19:52Z

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. My first job in the U.S. included covering Martha Stewart and World Wrestling Entertainment during the dot-com boom. Stewart was a multimedia influencer and doyenne of domesticity; Vince and Linda McMahon had transformed wrestling from a traveling circus of showmen and athletes into a superstar-studded global entertainment phenomenon. Today’s “trad wife” phenomenon or “manosphere” populated by the likes of Joe Rogan are not without precedent. Pop culture always reflects and responds to trends in the political sphere, and vice versa. What’s unusual, perhaps, is the degree to which the two worlds have become intertwined. It helps that Trump comes from that world, having spent several years in reality TV and most of his adult life as a media celebrity. Along with installing himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, President Trump personally picked this year’s list of honorees, which includes Kiss and Sylvester Stallone, and will host what he promises to be an ‘anti-woke’ ceremony. Few CEOs are more attuned to the political winds in Hollywood right now than David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount following Skydance Media’s merger with Paramount Global earlier this month. To get the deal done, Skydance agreed to “address bias and restore fact-based reporting,” according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and appoint an ombudsman to address any concerns about bias. Paramount had also reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris prior to the deal getting done. In one of his first moves as head of the combined Paramount, Ellison last week announced a $7.7 billion agreement to air Ultimate Fighting Championship events over the next seven years. That’s no doubt a smart business decision and certainly not lost on Ellison that UFC is a Trump-friendly form of entertainment, as well as a “global sports powerhouse.” UFC CEO Dana White said Ellison negotiated an “all-or-nothing” deal. White is close to Trump, who recently said he’d love to stage a UFC match on the White House lawn. (White also recently joined Meta’s board, too.) Ellison, meanwhile, also struck a multi-year partnership with Taylor Sheridan, the creative mind behind “Yellowstone” and various spinoffs that are popular with conservative audiences. To grow beyond the $30+ billion it made last year, Paramount will need to appeal to a wide and varied demographic. While its cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” sparked accusations of pro-Trump bias, Paramount’s recent $1.5 billion streaming deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone suggests that Ellison understands the power of polarizing entertainment on both sides of the house. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Zelenskyy goes to DC… Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington DC today, joined by European leaders including European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. The meeting follows an inconclusive meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. On social media, Trump ruled out Ukraine joining NATO, or getting back Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. …and China's top diplomat goes to Delhi Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in India for a trip aimed at repairing a relationship that’s been cool since deadly border clashes in 2020. The dispute has hurt trade and investment between the two Asian economic powers. Both countries also face steep U.S. tariffs: Trump’s decision to slap 50% tariffs on India now threatens a broader strategy to make the South Asian country an alternative to China. IgniteTech’s AI-induced layoffs Software developer IgniteTech laid off nearly 80% of its employees within a year to make way for generative AI. CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune that he’d do it again: “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” Powell to speak on Friday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will give an indication of whether rate cuts will resume next month in a speech on Friday. Some analysts think Powell will keep his cards close to his chest—and may not cut rates in September at all, despite Wall Street hopes of easing. Can OpenAI stay in front? OpenAI’s industry-leading position could be vulnerable, thanks to an underwhelming release of GPT-5 and new open-source challengers like China’s DeepSeek. Fortune’s Geoff Colvin investigates how strong the company’s competitive “moat” really is. S&P 500 futures are down by 0.1% before market open, following a 0.3% drop by the index on Friday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 is up 0.8%, briefly hitting a record high. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.9%, briefly surpassing a 10-year high. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%. The South Korea KOSPI is down 1.5%. The STOXX Europe 600 is down 0.1% in early trading, Bitcoin is down 2.5% to fall below $116,000.

Title: Coding boom turns bust: Computer science grads face AI-dominated hiring doldrums

A decade of tech-fueled advice led to a 133 percent surge in U.S. computer science majors, now struggling in a job market flooded with AI tools. Rising AI adoption reduces demand for junior developers; some graduates apply to thousands of jobs but find no offers. 7.5 percent unemployment for CS engineers â more than double the rate for art history or biology graduates. Companies like Microsoft now funnel resources into A.I. education amid decreased hiring. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs.

Companies like Microsoft now funnel resources into A.I. education amid decreased hiring. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. The "learn to code" mantra once promised a golden ticket to six-figure salaries in tech, but a wave of unemployment and disillusionment has replaced that optimism. Recent graduates with computer science degrees, enticed by corporate campaigns and federal initiatives, now confront a market where entry-level roles are shrinking due to AI tools and layoffs, leaving some to seek work at fast-food chains. The National Science Foundation reports that over 170,000 U.S. undergraduates majored in computer science in 2024 â more than double the 2014 total. Yet, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis reveals that unemployment among CS engineering graduates reached 7.5 percent in 2025, far exceeding rates for non-tech majors. Manasi Mishra, a 21-year-old Purdue graduate, epitomizes the shift. Despite excelling academically, she joked in a TikTok video that her only tech interview offer came from Chipotle, the burrito chain. âTech promised magic, but reality is bitter,â Mishra said, now pivoting to a sales role after months of job rejections. AI tools pinch entry-level opportunities The rise of AI coding platforms like GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit has catalyzed a seismic shift in tech hiring. These tools can auto-generate code, debug workflows and reduce the need for junior developers. San Francisco billboards now tout A.I. software that âdebugs faster than humans,â underscoring the new reality. âThereâs a doom loop,â said Matthew Martin, an economist with Oxford Economics. âEntry-level roles â precisely where graduates seek their first jobs â are the most vulnerable to automation.â Zach Taylor, an Oregon State graduate, applied to 5,762 tech jobs since spring 2023, earning 13 interviews but no offers. âItâs demoralizing,â Taylor admitted. Now relying on unemployment benefits, heâs returned to his parentsâ home, building side projects to stay relevant. Even government roles, once seen as a safety net, face hurdles. Jamie Spoeri, a Georgetown graduate, applied to 200 jobs after a National Science Foundation internship yet encountered federal hiring freezes and A.I.-filtered rÃ©sumÃ©s. âAI isnât just replacing code â itâs replacing humans in the hiring process,â said data scientist Audrey Roller, who faced instant algorithmic rejection. Corporate and government responses: AI training vs. industry realities Leaders are recalibrating education strategies. $4 billion from Microsoft now funds AI-centric training, while the Biden administrationâs âAI action planâ repurposes federal dollars to steer students toward machine learning roles. However, critics argue this ignores structural issues like outsourcing and the saturation of A.I. tools. Tracy Camp, director of the Computing Research Association, noted that many universities still lack cutting-edge AI curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for rapid industry shifts. âSchools are playing catch-up,â she said. Meanwhile, major layoffs at Amazon, Microsoft and Meta â triggered by economic uncertainty and automationÂ â are compounding the crisis. According to Voronoi data, U.S. software developer job postings peaked in early 2022 before plummeting 33 percent by mid-2025. Student stories: From code to complacency? Despite the setbacks, some graduates are adapting. Mishra, now in sales, credits her TikTok beauty gig with broadening her career vision. âI realized I love tech marketing, not coding,â she said. Others, like Spoeri, stay hopeful. âAI will create new niches,â she argued, but cautioned: âWeâre in a transition phase.â The psychological toll is acute. Researchers like Jeff Forbes, a former NSF official, warn of disillusionment. âLast yearâs grads were fighting for offers. Now, many canât find any job,â Forbes said. A new era of tech work or a system in crisis? The collapse of the âcoding boomâ narrative reflects a deeper disconnect between education and industry evolution. While AI tools offer efficiency gains, theyâve left a generation of tech graduates â many of whom followed corporate and government advice â struggling to justify their degrees. The solution may lie in blended skills: combining technical expertise with creativity, sales, or policy. As Mishraâs pivot shows, adaptability remains critical. Yet, resolving systemic issues â from outsourcing to uneven A.I. training â will require collaboration between academia, tech firms and policymakers to align workforce preparedness with market realities. For now, the once-golden age of computer science has entered a period of reckoning.

AI tools pinch entry-level opportunities The rise of AI coding platforms like GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit has catalyzed a seismic shift in tech hiring.

Title: Faraday Future Launches its “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy as a Pioneer in AI mobility and Web3 integration, Unveiling the “C10 Index” and the First “C10 Treasury” Product Announced by a U.S.-Listed Company

August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner. ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company. Founded in 2014, the Company’s mission is to disrupt the automotive industry by creating a user-centric, technology-first, and smart driving experience.

Title: Ex-Washington Post fact checker hits ‘absentee owner’ Bezos, tells him to commit to saving paper or sell it

Full Content:
Former Washington Post face checker Glenn Kessler spoke with Fox News Digital about the paper's "absentee owner" Jeff Bezos and the challenges the news outlet faces. The Washington Post is a sinking ship with a captain missing in action. And according to its now-former fact-checker, that missing captain is its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. "He has to be committed to it. If he's not committed to it, he should find someone else to own it," Glenn Kessler told Fox News Digital. "I feel like he was kind of committed to it. And then he's kind of an absentee owner, and he shouldn't be because it's, you know, one of the prime assets of American journalism." Kessler left the Post in July after more than 27 years at the paper — and his final years there were not the best. "What's so saddening is that five years ago, I would not have imagined The Washington Post would be in this state," Kessler said. WASHINGTON POST'S EFFORTS TO COURT CONSERVATIVES COULD DRIVE AWAY ITS LIBERAL READERS, EX-FACT CHECKER WARNS Former Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler says billionaire Jeff Bezos "has to be committed" to saving the paper he owns or "find someone else to own it." (Getty images / Singerhmk - wiki commons) Kessler never considered leaving the Post until he was presented with the buyout offer, which he accepted. The Post has been financially bleeding, so much so that it reportedly was on pace to lose at least $77 million in 2024. The buyouts had targeted the most veteran staffers, aiming to cut costs and ward off layoffs for the time being. The famed fact-checker was among several high-profile journalists and columnists who have left the paper in recent months, many of whom took issue with decisions and editorial changes Bezos himself had ordered. Kessler compared the Post to "being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone" in a piece he wrote on his newly-launched Substack account. "They have to have a vision of where they want to go. And I've not seen that vision yet. Or if there is a vision, it's not been clearly articulated," Kessler said. "It's gonna be a really rocky period in the news business in the next five to ten years. And the Post needs to be prepared for that. And I kind of feel like they've lost a lot of, you know, important sailors and captains to keep the ship going. So they're gonna have to make do with less." Bezos has been the target of intense blowback by liberals, who've accused him of bending the knee to President Donald Trump based on actions that have rocked the paper. First was his decision in October to halt the planned endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. Then, in February, he launched a new mission for the editorial pages to promote "personal liberties and free markets," vowing to not publish any pieces that go against those principles. Both instances sparked rebellion among the paper's liberal readers, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of subscriptions. Several staffers also resigned in protest. But Kessler wasn't always a Bezos critic. He credited the Amazon founder for saving the Post when he bought it in 2013. "Before Bezos bought the newspaper, it was in really bad shape," he told Fox News Digital. "People forget how, you know, because the Graham family didn't really have the resources to keep it going in the new era. And there had been a bunch of buyouts and people were asked to leave. So it had been a pretty grim period then." WASHINGTON POST BOMBARDED WITH ‘CAKE’ PARTIES FOR DEPARTING STAFFERS Kessler called Jeff Bezos an "absentee owner" of The Washington Post. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Things at the Post were souring so much so that Kessler himself had been interviewing for a different job outside the paper. That was until he was offered The Fact Checker stint in 2011, which he accepted, thinking that if the ship went down, he himself could stay afloat with his own "brand." "But then Bezos bought the paper, and he invested a lot of money in the paper," Kessler said. "So the size of the staff doubled. The number of foreign bureaus probably went up [by] at least a third. The resources devoted to engineering support surged, so the web pages started loading faster, and we could do fantastic graphics. There was investment in video… And you really felt like the Post was going places, and it was actually producing better journalism at any point in the time I had worked at the Post." "And now it is just… it's like it hit an iceberg, and it's kind of drifting there, and I don't think there's a plan to rescue it. Or at least a plan to, you know, turn the ship around and get it moving in the direction it was." Kessler blamed management for being "a little dazzled" by the traffic spike that came during the first Trump administration, reaching levels "almost equal" to the Post's top rival, The New York Times. But then, unlike the Times, the Post failed to capitalize on its new readers by not expanding its portfolio. "I've sat in many meetings and had many discussions and heard lots of speeches. I still have no idea what they're trying to do," Kessler said of his former bosses. "It vaguely seems to say we're gonna appeal [to] the people… who don't really care about the news. And we're gonna provide products that would allow them to read The Washington Post and find out information they need to know," he said. "And the problem, as I wrote in my piece, is that that's what The New York Times has been doing for ten years. They have 10 million subscribers, but a large chunk of that are people that don't get the core news product," Kessler continued. "They get the recipes, they get The Athletic — the sports section, they get product recommendations, they get the games, they play Wordle." WASHINGTON POST REELING FROM BUYOUT EXODUS AS BOSSES HOPE TO TURN THE PAGE AT EMBATTLED PAPER He said the Post is stuck with "the Avis problem," citing the car rental company's old ads that claimed "We try harder," alluding to the reality it was always in the shadow of Hertz, a dynamic similar to the Gray Lady. "The Washington Post has always been No. 2. It's never had the same size circulation as the Times. I would argue news coverage was better, but maybe I was biased about that," Kessler conceded to Fox News Digital. "But now in this fragmented marketplace, people have to make a choice. What Substacks am I going to subscribe to? What newsletters am I gonna get? What networks am I going to watch? ‘Oh, I need one newspaper. I'll be willing to spend money on one newspaper,' and the default is always going to be, unfortunately, The New York Times." He continued, "It's a broader product. It has better arts coverage, theater coverage. I've never gotten an understanding of how the Post was going to combat that problem. And it sounded like the solution was, 'Oh, we're going to be like a mini-me New York Times with things to appeal to people that don't follow news.' Well, they already get that in The New York Times." The Post has scrapped an initiative launched last year dubbed "WP Ventures," meant to attract social media users. However, the paper appears to already be pivoting with Tuesday's announcement of former Axios executive editor and former Post reporter, Sara Kehaulani Goo, returning as its president of Creator Network — a new position Goo says will be "creating personality-driven content" and help provide advertisers "access" to a new audience driven by creators. The Washington Post had just implemented a round of buyouts targeting the most veteran of staffers. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) The Times and the rise of new media weren't the only obstacles facing the Post. "Midway through my journalism career, I started saying, 'I'm working for a dinosaur.' And AI is quite possibly the meteorite that will kill off the last of the dinosaurs," Kessler said to Fox News Digital. "I'm greatly concerned about what AI is gonna do, because AI is gonna kill search. And search was how people often found our news articles." "The statistics I had seen was that four or five years ago, every 100 searches on Google yielded six clicks on a news site. Now it's about every 100 searches yields two clicks on the news site. When people use AI, a thousand searches result in one click," he continued. "So it's a dramatic difference. And if I were running a news organization, at this point, I don't know quite what I would do about that. So it's a bad time to be running a new organization. I do have sympathy for the situation that [Washington Post publisher and CEO] Will Lewis and [Washington Post executive editor] Matt Murray find themselves in right now. I just question whether or not they really have figured out what to do." Goo said in her announcement that "we're going to be infusing AI with everything that we do to help us maximize efficiency and scale." But the buck ultimately stops with Bezos, according to Kessler. "The Post was really at its high point [after Bezos' purchase]— the amount of stories we're producing, the quality of the stories was really significant. And then, traffic surged when Trump got elected and there was so much hunger and interest in the news we were producing. We kind of lost our way after that," Kessler said. "And not only lost our way, we started losing oodles of money. A hundred million dollars one year, I think the last number I saw [in] 2023 was $77 million… I think even for a person as rich as Jeff Bezos, that counts as real money." "And I have gotten the sense that he's a bit of an absentee owner. He's had other distractions, and he's committed more to some of his other enterprises, such as a space company, than he is to The Washington Post, which is really just a tiny part of his business investments. And maybe, I don't know, I hate to speculate, maybe you thought he gave us his best shot, and we blew it, and now we've got it muddled through," he added. A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, "The Washington Post is reinventing itself to be a trusted news source for all Americans. That means working hard each day to publish the most accurate news, alongside opinions that resonate across the nation."

August 17, 2025 09:49 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: These Dirt Cheap Dividends Pay 4x-9x The Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/17/these-dirt-cheap-dividends-pay-4x-9x-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-08-17T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The market-at-large is expensive by historical metrics. So let’s look past the pricey, low-yielding ETFs in favor of cheap dividends. That’s right, good ol’ value investing bargains. With high yields too! We’re talking about divvies of 5%, 8% and even 11% that we’ll discuss in a moment. The spring market dip sure was brief, wasn’t it? The S&P 500 sank into near-bear territory in roughly a month, then snapped back just as quick. In doing so, Mr. and Ms. Market took valuations to high levels. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We’ll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two “cash is king” metrics: Let’s start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don’t have. It’s also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it’s also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company—this one more typical of the sector. It’s the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business—Trio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more “exciting.” It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had “violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.” SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there’s a lot to like about Edison. It’s expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX’s yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can’t ignore the fire liabilities—they’re why EIX’s valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That’s because, as a packaging specialist, it’s in the business of—well, other business’s business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor’s products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it’s able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There’s nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That’s in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry’s largest compression fleet. Kodiak’s fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There’s not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy’s weakness this year—and left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It’s not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven’t had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there’s any silver lining to that, it’s that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator—crucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It’s unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it’s also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that—in hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes—it would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn’t bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That’s 99%!) CEO Carol Tomé continued to signal commitment to the dividend in the earnings call—“UPS is rock-solid strong and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet,” she said—but if the delivery giant continues to struggle, simple numbers might force management’s hand. Western Union (WU, 11.3% yield), somehow, is still in business. Payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle have been taking business from the “OG” of money transfer. WU boasts a big yield but for the wrong reason—its divvie looks big because shares are (deservedly) way down! WU, to its credit, has launched an initiative called “Evolve 2025” in which it’s rolling out new products, improvements and an operational efficiency program. It’s also expanding its digital wallet offerings in Mexico and Singapore. And its latest move, announced just a couple days ago, is the $500 million acquisition of Miami-based International Money Express (IMXI), aka Intermex, which serves some 6 million customers who send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany to more than 60 countries.

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The market-at-large is expensive by historical metrics. So let’s look past the pricey, low-yielding ETFs in favor of cheap dividends. That’s right, good ol’ value investing bargains. With high yields too! We’re talking about divvies of 5%, 8% and even 11% that we’ll discuss in a moment. The spring market dip sure was brief, wasn’t it? The S&P 500 sank into near-bear territory in roughly a month, then snapped back just as quick. In doing so, Mr. and Ms. Market took valuations to high levels. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We’ll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two “cash is king” metrics: Let’s start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don’t have. It’s also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it’s also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company—this one more typical of the sector. It’s the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business—Trio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more “exciting.” It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had “violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.” SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there’s a lot to like about Edison. It’s expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX’s yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can’t ignore the fire liabilities—they’re why EIX’s valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That’s because, as a packaging specialist, it’s in the business of—well, other business’s business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor’s products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it’s able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There’s nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That’s in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry’s largest compression fleet. Kodiak’s fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There’s not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy’s weakness this year—and left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It’s not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven’t had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there’s any silver lining to that, it’s that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator—crucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It’s unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it’s also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that—in hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes—it would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn’t bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That’s 99%!)
