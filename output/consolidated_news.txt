Title: Nasdaq applies to include staking in BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF as SEC weighs broader industry requests

BlackRock now joins a list of similar requests from issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21shares. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The rule change would add a detailed “staking” section permitting BlackRock to stake Ethereum (ETH) directly or through one or more trusted staking providers. BlackRock would treat received rewards as income, and the firm must hold the staked coins in arrangements consistent with a May statement by the SEC Division of Corporation Finance on certain protocol staking activities. Notably, the asset manager must also obtain either a counsel opinion or US government guidance on federal tax treatment before it starts. Furthermore, in the event of slashing or forking, BlackRock will not subsidize or absorb incoming losses. Nasdaq stated that its proposal would enable ETHA to capture returns while operating under defined constraints intended to protect shareholders and the market. BlackRock joins a queue of issuers that have asked regulators to let their US-based spot Ethereum products earn protocol rewards. Cboe seeks authority for Fidelity’s FETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, Invesco Galaxy’s QETH, and 21shares’ CETH. On NYSE Arca, Bitwise seeks approval to stake the ETH held in its ETHW. At the same time, Grayscale seeks the same approval for its ETHE and mini trust. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reacted to the Nasdaq submission on X, saying it was “about time.” The first final deadline for prior filings is in October, while the deadline for Nasdaq’s filing on BlackRock’s ETF is in early April. However, Seyffart believes it is unlikely for the SEC approval to take that long. US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $726 million in net inflows across nine funds on July 16, marking a daily record. ETHA led allocations with $499.2 million, marking a record for daily inflows into the fund, representing nearly 69% of the total. The heavy inflows may indicate that institutional investors are betting on Ethereum’s fundamentals, such as its infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenized assets.

Title: Amazon trims workforce in Cloud Division AWS citing rising AI-driven costs: Report

Amazon.com Inc. has begun cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as the tech giant recalibrates its priorities in the face of growing artificial intelligence-related expenses, as per a report. According to a statement provided to Bloomberg by company spokesperson Brad Glasser on Thursday, the layoffs are affecting several teams within AWS, the world's largest cloud services provider. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” Glasser said via email, as per the news outlet. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition.” The job cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations while continuing to invest in innovation. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Glasser added, as per the news publication. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had signaled this direction earlier. In June, he stated that the company expects a reduction in its workforce over the coming years as it leverages artificial intelligence to automate a growing number of internal tasks. Amazon is the latest among major tech companies to trim headcount in response to the shifting cost dynamics of AI development and deployment, underscoring the complex tradeoffs between automation, innovation, and human capital. As of the end of March, Amazon reportedly was the second-largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with a total workforce of 1.56 million. While the majority are warehouse employees handling packing and shipping, over 350,000 hold corporate positions. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp. — another tech giant heavily investing in AI — initiated a new round of layoffs affecting approximately 9,000 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction this year.

Title: Amazon slashing hundreds of jobs at AWS cloud unit — month after CEO says AI will spur layoffs: report

Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday, two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” AWS sales rose 17% in the first quarter to $29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23% to $11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers.

Amazon.com Inc. is cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, the latest big tech company to pare its headcount amid rising costs for artificial intelligence. The firings affected various teams at Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing service, company spokesperson Brad Glasser said Thursday. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS” he said in an emailed statement. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in June that he expected Amazon’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the company uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp., which has also been spending lavishly on AI, began job cuts that will impact about 9,000 workers, its second major wave of layoffs this year. Reuters, citing people familiar with the situation, earlier reported that the Amazon job cuts will affect hundreds of people. The company declined to say how many positions are being eliminated. Amazon is the largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most of those people work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but more than 350,000 of them worked in corporate jobs.

Title: BlackRock, Nasdaq seek SEC approval to add staking to BlackRock’s spot Ether ETF

Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:45:26Z
Full Content:
Share this article Nasdaq has proposed a rule change with the SEC to enable staking capabilities for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, also known as ETHA. According to a new 19b-4 filing, the fund would be able to stake all or a portion of ETHA’s Ether through one or more trusted staking providers if granted approval by the securities regulator. The proposal also indicates that staking rewards would be treated as income. With this move, BlackRock officially joins a number of fund managers pursuing permission to incorporate staking into their Ethereum funds. These include 21Shares, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Cboe BZX Exchange filed, on behalf of 21Shares, to seek comments regarding permitting the staking of Ether held by the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the filing in February. In March, the exchange filed a proposal to enable staking for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET). NYSE Arca submitted a proposal on behalf of Grayscale to enable Ethereum staking within its ETFs, specifically the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Before the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, industry leaders such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco/Galaxy had sought to offer staking as part of their Ethereum ETFs. This feature would have allowed fund managers to stake the underlying Ethereum holdings, generating additional yields for investors through the Ethereum network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. However, the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, raised concerns that staking-as-a-service offerings could be classified as unregistered securities. The regulator previously targeted firms offering staking services, like Coinbase and Kraken. In response to the SEC’s position, these firms amended their Ethereum ETF applications and removed the staking provisions. The removal of staking capabilities was speculated to influence ARK Invest’s decision to withdraw its Ethereum ETF plans. Without staking, the ETFs would only track Ether’s price, excluding the approximately 3% yield available through staking rewards. This makes the product less attractive to investors seeking growth in their holdings through staking rewards. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Amazon workers are piecing together cloud division layoffs in internal messages

Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut. Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic. Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment. The company has yet to respond to a request about what makes an employee eligible. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Title: Shark Tank star Daniel Lubetzky says college is not the ‘end all, be all’—he tells Gen Z to learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic instead
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/shark-tank-star-billionaire-daniel-lubetzsky-college-not-end-all-be-all-skilled-trade-industry-lucrative-carpenter-mechanic-gen-z/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:01:29Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z is having a career nightmare. Business leaders have all but predicted a demise of entry-level, white-collar work. Already, many young people are being left with mounds of student loan debt and a ritzy qualification but no job to their name. Luckily, according to billionaire Daniel Lubetzky, there remains plenty of opportunity for Gen Z—if they look in the right places. “For those people that have great ideas or great opportunities and don’t want to go to college, I don’t think college is an end all, be all or required thing,” Lubetzky the newest judge on Shark Tank, tells Fortune. Despite making a name for himself in entrepreneurship by selling his snack company KIND to Mars in 2020 for $5 billion, Lubetzky says young people could make a killing going down the skilled trade route. “Vocational training and learning how to be a carpenter or a mechanic or any of those jobs is a huge field with huge opportunities that pays really, really well,” he adds. Lubetzky is on the money: While jobs like software engineer or graphic designer may be harder to come by in the coming years thanks to AI job replacements, fields in the skilled trade space are thriving in part off an increased demand for data centers. Plus, with often only an apprenticeship or on-the-job training required, it could be an accessible way for professionals to transition their careers and gain six-figure salaries. While the skilled trade industry isn’t foolproof—and is still plagued with seasonality and safety hazards—job openings remain high. The U.S. construction industry alone had 245,000 job openings in May 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The manufacturing sector had over 414,000 jobs. While Gen Z may have grown up with aspirations to attend an Ivy League and then land a top Silicon Valley job, that reality may have been a disservice to young people—and many have felt this the hard way. So far this year, over 80,000 tech workers have experienced layoffs. To rub salt in the wound, leaders such as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have been transparent that AI is making it easier than ever to reduce corporate ranks. “We’ve made a mistake in society in not sufficiently celebrating builders, not just builders of schools and of KIND bars, but builders of physical bridges and builders of gears,” Lubetzky says. “We in society need to start celebrating those professionals more.” The 56-year-old adds that universities have “failed us” over the last 20 to 30 years by neglecting to teach young people how to be critical thinkers and listeners—or in his words, a “builder’s mindset,” meaning prioritizing curiosity, creativity, compassion and courage. “Having a builder’s mindset is so essential to our society and under curiosity fits critical thinking, critical listening, all of those things,” Lubetzky stresses. The skilled trade industry has the potential to be a safe haven from AI’s revolution on white-collar work. In fact, many young people have already seen the writing on the wall, with enrollment at trade-focused institutions increasing almost 20% since the spring of 2020, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. However, the career path may not be as lucrative as some promise it to be. Trade roles are among the worst entry-level U.S. jobs, according to a new WalletHub study. Welders, automotive mechanics, boilermakers bottomed out on the list, thanks in part to their lack of growth potential and high job hazard. Trade industries also have high unemployment levels due to their seasonal nature, as well as reportedly lower levels of happiness. But either way, Lubetzky says trying something out and deciding you don’t like it—or failing—can be critical to advancing through your career. “Sometimes a failure is more valuable than a success,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo July 17 (Reuters) – China is threatening to block the sale of more than 40 ports, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) if Chinese shipping company Cosco does not get a stake, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. Reuters could not immediately verify the WSJ report. CK Hutchison, MSC, BlackRock and Cosco did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment, while the Chinese government could not be immediately reached outside office hours. Chinese officials have told BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison that if Cosco is left out of the deal, Beijing would take steps to block Hutchison’s proposed sale of the ports, the newspaper said. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison in March announced it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value of $22.8 billion, including debt. After much scrutiny and criticism in China, Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison confirmed in May Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC, one of the world’s top container shipping groups, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy the ports. BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison all are open to Cosco taking a stake, WSJ said. However, the parties would likely not reach a deal before a previously agreed upon July 27 deadline for exclusive talks between BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison, the report added. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced.

Business A logo for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France on Jun 12, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Benoit Tessier) SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday (Jul 17), two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people.

Loading “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable". "Wherever possible, we’ve worked hard to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are impacted," it added. AWS sales rose 17 per cent in the first quarter to US$29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23 per cent to US$11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable".

Title: China threatens to squash Panama ports deal unless its shipping giant gets an equal stake: report

Full Content:
China has threatened to block a deal for dozens of global ports – including two near the Panama canal – if its own shipping giant doesn’t get a sizable stake, according to a report Thursday. The deal, valued at around $20 billion, hands over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to US asset manager BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. China is demanding that Cosco, its largest shipping firm, be an equal partner to BlackRock and MSC in the deal, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. BlackRock, MSC and Li’s firm, CK Hutchison, are all open to that idea, sources said. “As far as I know, Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation once stated that it would review in accordance with the law the plan of CK Hutchison Holdings to sell assets such as the Panama Canal Port, to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, told The Post in a statement. “As principle, I would like to stress that China has always firmly opposed economic coercion and domineering and bullying practices.” MSC and Cosco did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. The firms are currently staring down a July 27 deadline, when exclusive talks between the three partners will end and Cosco can be added to the deal. But that change will likely anger President Trump, who has viewed the deal as a national security win as he argues that the US needs to “take back” the waterway. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have told Chinese state-owned companies to freeze any incoming deals with Hutchison or other businesses linked to Li, sources told the Journal. The inclusion of Cosco emerged as a way to nudge the deal forward following intense US-China trade talks in Switzerland, Bloomberg reported last month. Chinese authorities have told BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison that without Cosco’s inclusion in the deal, Beijing will take steps to block the sale, sources said. And the firms involved in the deal can’t afford to burn bridges with China. BlackRock and Hutchison both have interests in the nation, and MSC is one of the largest shippers of Chinese exports in the world. Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business, MSC, has emerged as the lead investor in the deal, though BlackRock is notably expected to take over the two key Panama ports included in the sale. The deal is expected to position MSC as the world’s largest terminal operator. It wouldn’t be the first time China has squashed such a deal. In 2014, it blocked a major shipping alliance between MSC, Denmark’s AP Moeller-Maersk and France’s CMA CGM.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/11: In this photo illustration, the Rigetti Computing logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Microsoft is on track to become the second $4 trillion company by market cap, following NVIDIA — and mass layoffs

Microsoft's share price rose over 19% this year so far, vastly outperforming the overall market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA might have clinched the world-first $4 trillion crown, but Microsoft could be hot on its heels. As stock performance goes, Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella has been a shining star, for better or worse. Microsoft's market capitalization as of writing is $3.758 trillion, putting it just shy of NVIDIA's $4.179 trillion. Microsoft has comfortably began to outpace Apple, at $3.1 trillion, as investors get nervous about Apple's position (or lack thereof) in a world increasingly dominated by AI. Indeed, NVIDIA and Microsoft's market position in recent times has been driven by cloud services. NVIDIA providing the hardware, and Microsoft providing the software, in essence. NVIDIA's server technology is powering the global artificial intelligence goldrush. Microsoft's Azure data center operations, in combination with its OpenAI partnership, is powering the back end for hundreds of thousands of Azure customer — and millions of their customers by extension. Indeed, Apple itself is reportedly leveraging Azure and OpenAI's models to power some of its platform features, showing the virtue of Satya Nadella's big cloud investment strategy. Microsoft's share price has risen by over 15% this year as of writing, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by a comfortable amount. Microsoft's stock has become a hot ticket in recent years owing to big dividend payouts and stock buyback programs. Those who invested back at the start of the cloud goldrush have made mountains of profits with Microsoft stock, and that looks set to continue as cloud underpins practically every new technological leap. Without cloud, there's no AI, there's no Netflix, no Amazon, no web services, apps, online games, and so on — and its this that has driven Microsoft to market capitalization dominance in recent years. Microsoft has also invested heavily in subscription-based services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure platforms, and even Xbox Game Pass — giving it reliable and steady revenue that outperforms retail trends and provides resilience against consumer confidence, to a degree. But there's still risk factors involved. Some analysts regard Microsoft stock as overly expensive right now, which is probably partially why Microsoft has had so many layoffs this past year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Boosting margins and increasing profits-per-employee is a short-term way to grow into its valuation, but as I wrote last week, the chilling effect its layoffs has on employee morale and product quality could do long-term harm. Windows, Xbox, Surface, and other consumer-facing Microsoft products have stagnated in some ways, some more than others — leaving the diversification of Microsoft's business vulnerable. One has to wonder just how much of Microsoft's current strategy revolves around boosting the stock price, given exec pay packets are often tied to stock, rather than actually providing high-quality products. You'd think the stock price would go hand in hand with high-quality products, but many of Microsoft's existing offerings, particularly in the consumer segment, leave a lot to be desired. Its enviable second place position in cloud isn't guaranteed either, as Google and others rapidly invest in catching up. Google also doesn't need to rely on OpenAI for its AI models either, potentially giving it an advantage when it comes to innovating new products. There's also been jitters that agentic AI, that is, AI that can basically fully replace humans, might paradoxically impact some of Microsoft's enterprise software businesses. Microsoft has shown itself to be adaptable and versatile when navigating new technological paradigms, but this rapid shifting of priorities has often been viewed as presenting inconsistent and unreliable to consumers. Microsoft's business to business operations remain its core strength, regardless, and it's likely this fact that will drive its market capitalization above $4 trillion in the coming weeks or months ahead. But things can change rapidly in tech, even for big players like Microsoft. Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Title: A second-generation molecular clamp stabilised bivalent candidate vaccine for protection against diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312

Full Content:
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two medically important causes of respiratory tract infections and diseases. After more than five decades of research and development, vaccines have recently been approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, vaccines for hMPV remain in early-stage development. Here we describe the design and characterisation as well as pre-clinical development of a bivalent vaccine, VXB-241, comprised of the recombinantly expressed viral fusion proteins from both RSV and hMPV, stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the second-generation molecular clamp (MC2S) and key pre-fusion stabilizing mutations. Each of the two antigens were produced at high yield in a mammalian expression system and purified by an affinity capture resin specific to MC2S. Each antigen was demonstrated to adopt the pre-fusion conformation, which was stable for at least twelve months in liquid formulation at 2–8°C. Head-to-head evaluation in mouse immunogenicity studies showed that the VXB-241 candidate vaccine induced a neutralising immune response that was superior or equivalent to the pre-fusion stabilised comparator antigens for either RSV or hMPV, including the RSVPreF3 antigen of the licensed RSV vaccine, Arexvy (GSK). The results presented here have supported progression of VXB-241 into a Phase 1 clinical trial which commenced enrolment in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06556147). A second-generation molecular clamp was used to help lock viral glycoproteins in a stabilised native prefusion conformation to elicit highly protective immunity and to enable consistent manufacture of highly stable, ready-to-use, fully liquid vaccines. The first- and second-generation molecular clamp platforms were previously validated in two successful Phase 1 clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (NCT04495933 and NCT05775887). This work is the first presentation of the pre-clinical development of a multi-pathogen vaccine, VXB-241 targeting both RSV and hMPV. The two antigens (VXB-213 and VXB-221) were shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 2–8°C and are able to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV in mouse immunogenicity study. VXB-241 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06556147). Citation: Young A, Kolekar S, Mendoza CA, Jaberolansar N, Modhiran N, Webb T, et al.

RSV was discovered in 1956 and causes infections at all ages and is a major cause of severe illness, especially for infants and older adults. There are 2 major antigenic subtypes of human RSV (A and B). By 2 years of age, virtually all children will have been infected with RSV. RSV is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, the epidemiology of RSV shows high incidence of RSV hospitalisation among older patients as well as high risk for severe disease in immunocompromised adults [1]. Long-term care facility residents are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks and serious illness [2]. RSV burden of severe disease may be comparable to influenza [1]. Since the discovery of hMPV in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. Through genetic analysis hMPV has been characterised into 2 groups A and B which are further divided into 4 sub-lineages [3]. hMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. hMPV is associated with acute lower respiratory infections and can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Overall, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are like those in RSV infection [4]. Although nearly all populations will experience primary hMPV infection by age 5, hMPV re-infection occurs throughout adult life. Rates of hospitalisation of children for hMPV infection are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Pre-existing conditions, particularly asthma, play a role in disease severity and hospitalisation [5]. It has been documented that both RSV and hMPV have a high incidence rate and burden of illness, especially amongst susceptible populations including newborns, young children under 5 years of age, older adults, elderly and immunocompromised host. In children under five years of age, RSV infections were estimated to cause per year 33 million acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and to be associated to 3.6 million hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths worldwide [6]. Within the paediatric population globally in 2018, hMPV infection was estimated to be the cause per year of 11 million ALRI cases, 502,000 hospitalisations and 11,300 deaths [7]. In older adults over the age of 60, RSV infection is estimated to account for 5.2 million ALRIs, 470,000 hospitalisations and 33,000 deaths in high-income countries alone [8]. Within the older adult population, the burden of disease caused by hMPV has been less intensely studied, however there is an increased availability and implementation of molecular assays in clinical practice to analyse the virus causing lower respiratory tract disease [9]. Recent studies, conducted in the US and several countries worldwide, have shown that RSV and hMPV are similarly related to acute respiratory diseases, with similar reported percentage of virus detection, hospitalisations and deaths in susceptible populations [10]. After more than 5 decades of research and development [11,12], three vaccines have recently been approved in Europe, the USA and elsewhere for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults: two subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13] and Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14], and a mRNA vaccine, MRESVIA (Moderna) [15]. Abrysvo has also received approval for vaccination during pregnancy for the protection of infants against RSV throughout the first six months following birth [16]. Each vaccine has demonstrated high levels of protective efficacy and favourable safety in their respective target populations [13–16]. The transformational discovery at the heart of these advances has been the recognition that during the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, glycoprotein F transitions irreversibly from a pre-fusion (RSV preF) to a post-fusion (RSV postF) conformation. RSV preF is an unstable conformation that is able to elicit strong neutralising antibody (nAb) activity while the conformationally more stable RSV postF elicits poor nAb activity [17,18]. While there are no vaccines currently available for hMPV, a bivalent mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna targeting hMPV and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) has demonstrated potential to boost neutralisation responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial [19]. Moderna is currently conducting further clinical trials of a bivalent mRNA vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV. Icosavax, now part of AstraZeneca, is also developing a bivalent RSV-hMPV vaccine (IVX-A12), based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which has been demonstrated to boost neutralsing antibody titres against both RSV and hMPV by 3–5 fold [20]. As with RSV, the hMPV preF has been demonstrated to elicit a higher neutralising immune response than hMPV postF [21–24], however there are also some differences between the two viruses. For RSV most neutralising immune responses are specific to RSV preF [17,18], however for hMPV neutralising immune responses overlap between hMPV preF and postF [25–27], with some neutralising antibodies (nAbs) recognising epitopes on the internal trimer interface [25,28]. While the newly approved RSV vaccines have great potential to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce the burden on hospitals during peak RSV seasons, equitable distribution of ready-to-use vaccine formulations remains a significant barrier to access these important vaccines, especially within LMICs. Both approved subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and MRESVIA, like other mRNA vaccines, is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration, cannot be refrozen and must be discarded if not used within 24 hours of thawing [14]. Such requirements complicate real world use. Costly manufacturing and distribution requirements also likely add to the price per dose for these vaccines, impacting global supply and equitable access. A further challenge exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) as vaccination compliance becomes more challenging. The prospect of adding further vaccines to cover and protect against high burden respiratory diseases caused by other viruses such as hMPV and PIV into the current schedule will increase compliance challenges. To address this medical need, multivalent vaccines will be of increased importance and will require developing stable antigens that can be combined in one vaccine. In this work, we describe the development and pre-clinical evaluation of a bivalent candidate vaccine (VXB-241) to provide protection against RSV and hMPV ALRIs. VXB-241 is composed of two antigens: RSV preF (VXB-213) and hMPV preF (VXB-221). The two antigens are stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the proprietary second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp (MC2S) platform, which enables trimerisation and purification, and key pre-fusion stabilising mutations. The two candidate vaccine antigens show high production yield, liquid stability and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway with the key objective being the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). Following the finding in late 2020 that the immune response induced by a first-generation molecular clamp (MC)-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sclamp, interfered with some HIV diagnostic tests [29], the original MC platform was re-engineered to avoid the use of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41. A panel of candidate heptad repeat sequences was screened to identify those that form highly stable 6HB structures. Subsequent rounds of optimisation and testing led to the identification of molecular clamp 2 (MC2); details available WO2023187743. As HIV-1 gp41 derived sequences are not included in MC2, cross-reactivity to HIV diagnostics was not anticipated. However, given the similarities in quaternary structure, to rule this out an ELISA was conducted using two different reference serum samples readily available for HIV diagnostic testing. Testing via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both NIBSC HIV reference serum and BioRad Geenius HIV+ control serum revealed reactivity to MC but no detectable reactivity to MC2 (S1 Fig). Both MC and MC2 were compared, and tested with three different viral antigens that had been validated on the first-generation platform (antigen from SARS-CoV-2 [29], Nipah virus [30], influenza A virus [31]), as well as an early iteration of the RSV preF antigen that was in development. For the four antigens; comparable antigen homogeneity and oligomeric characteristics were conferred by MC and MC2, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (S2 Fig). Immunogenicity in mice was also compared, with sera from mice vaccinated with MC2 and MC2S stabilised antigens shown to elicit equivalent or superior levels of neutralising immune responses compared to MC (S3 Fig). The second-generation clamp was further developed to incorporate additional N-linked glycosylation sites to dampen immunogenicity, referred to as Molecular Clamp 2 Silenced (MC2S). RSV preF incorporating MC2S was compared to MC and MC2, with antigen homogeneity again shown to be comparable and superior neutralising immune responses elicited in mice compared to MC (S2 and S3 Figs). The effect of silencing was demonstrated by comparing the immune response in mice after vaccination with RSV F antigen containing either MC, MC2 or MC2S. The relative percentage of elicited IgG binding to MC2S was reduced by >2-fold from a geometric mean of 34.3% for MC2 to 15.8% for MC2S (S4 Fig). To further determine whether there was any cross-reactivity to HIV gp41, sera from mouse vaccinated with either MC or MC2 stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analysed by ELISA against HIV gp41. The MC2 stabilised spike elicited approximately 38-fold lower cross-reactivity compared to MC, essentially at, or near the LoD of the assay (S5 Fig). The RSV and hMPV candidate vaccine antigens including MC2S were generated and analysed side by side with well characterised recombinant protein controls for comparison. Briefly, there were two categories of controls, controls that were classed as non-stabilised soluble controls (RSV Fsol and hMPV Fsol), and controls that were preF stabilised benchmark comparators with a foldon trimerisation domain (RSV DsCav1 [32], hMPV DsCavEs2 [21] and hMPV v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23]). From the new candidate vaccine antigens containing MC2S, one antigen has been selected for RSV, RSV preF, called VXB-213 and another for hMPV, hMPV preF, called VXB-221. VXB-213 was engineered to include the optimal disulfide bridge linkages and furin cleavage site deletion identified by McLellan et al., [32] and Joyce et al., [33], whereas VXB-221 included an unmodified TMPRSS2 cleavage site, a proline substitution and a single disulfide bridge [21,34]. The nomenclature with brief description of each antigen is summarised in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312.t001 At a research laboratory scale for antigen discovery purposes, the recombinant antigens were expressed as secretable proteins in mammalian suspension culture (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ExpiCHO-S, Thermofisher) and purified from clarified supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using either a ligand-resin with affinity for MC2S (AVI-8740) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral ectodomain. They were buffer exchanged into PBS and characterised by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex Increase 10 300 GL (Cytiva) SEC column (Fig 1). Both the RSV and hMPV antigen panels showed similar trends for their oligomerisation profiles, with the non-stabilised Fsol proteins producing the greatest proportion of aggregate (RSV Fsol, 94% aggregate, 0% trimer; hMPV Fsol, 25% aggregate, 19% trimer, 56% monomer), the MC2S-incorporating antigens showing high degrees of trimer homogeneity (>89% trimer for both VXB-213 and VXB-221) with the comparator antigens being intermediate to these two (RSV DSCav1, 69% trimer; hMPV DSCavEs2, 54% trimer). hMPV DsCavEs2 produced two overlapping peaks within the trimeric fractions, suggesting that the trimer may adopt distinct conformational or oligomeric states. This observation differs from the results reported by Hsieh et al., [22], where hMPV DSCavEs2 was expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells, in the presence of co-transfected Furin and an additional SEC purification step. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that RSV DSCav1 produced here in expiCHO-S (Thermofisher), may be conformationally different to that produced by McLellan et al., in HEK293K cells [32].

For the RSV antigens, ELISAs were performed in a sandwich format with antigens captured using a reformatted murine IgG2 isotype of Motavizumab [35] and probed with preF-specific human-type mAbs D25 [36], MPE8 [37] and AM14 [38]. For VXB-213 (Vicebio RSV preF) and the DsCav1 comparator, sub-nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) for all three mAbs were observed (Fig 1G). AM14 binds a preF, quaternary epitope and its binding to vaccine antigens has been correlated with protective immunity [38]. This mAb showed poor reactivity to the non-stabilised Fsol antigen, while binding VXB-213 with 8 picomolar KD; a 6-fold higher avidity relative to DsCav1. For the hMPV antigens, a broader panel of mAbs targeting diverse epitopes across the topology of preF was tested against the antigen series in an indirect ELISA format (Fig 1H). VXB-221 (Vicebio hMPV preF) was shown to be recognised with sub-nanomolar binding to five of the six mAbs tested. Only DS7 [39], which binds to the post-fusion conformation or a pre/post intermediate, showed low affinity for VXB-221. Neutralising antibodies with moderate or strong pre-fusion preference (MPV467, MPV-487 and MPE8) [37,40], showed similar sub-nanomolar affinities for VXB-221 and comparator antigens DSCavEs2 and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, but poor reactivity for hMPV Fsol. Neutralising antibodies known to recognise the internal trimer interface (MPV-458 and M8C10) [25,40], were able to bind with sub-nanomolar affinity to MPV-Fsol, DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 but showed poor affinity for v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, which contains an interprotomer disulphide bridge and has been optimised to adopt a closed, pre-fusion conformation [23]. Further analysis of the antigens by SDS-PAGE showed that the VXB-213 and VXB-221 were both highly pure and homogenous bands of predicted size for the non-cleaved products (S6 Fig). RSV Fsol and DsCav1 controls both showed a major band at the appropriate size for the furin cleaved product. hMPV Fsol showed a major band consistent with the non-cleaved product, DsCavEs2 also showed the presence of two major bands consistent with partial furin cleavage. All four controls exhibited some smearing that could be due to either impurities or proteolytic degradation. The ability of each antigen to deplete neutralising antibodies from a pooled human plasma sample was compared either by directly pre-incubating plasma with antigens in solution or with immobilised antigens coupled to CNBR Activated Sepharose (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous reports [17,18], RSV Fsol performed poorly at removing neutralising antibodies from human plasma, whereas both DSCav1 and VXB-213, were highly efficient at depleting neutralising antibodies (S7A Fig). DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 were also both able to efficiently deplete hMPV neutralising antibodies, although hMPV Fsol was not tested (S7B Fig). BALB/c mice were immunised with 2 µg of the recombinant antigens by intramuscular injection (IM) in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). To ensure RSV and hMPV Fsol antigens were fully in the post-fusion state they were first heated to 70°C for 2 hrs. At completion, analysis of mouse sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the immunisations had been effective in inducing IgG against each respective antigen. The bivalent candidate vaccine, VXB-241 (a combination of VXB-213 and VXB-221), elicited a response to both the RSV preF and hMPV preF antigens (Fig 2A). Each antigen also elicited a response to the trimer stabilising domain that was detectable via ELISA with a non-homologous antigen (Nipah F) stabilised with either foldon or MC2S. By comparing EC50 values for total antigen-specific IgG and tag-specific IgG for each mouse we were able to estimate the proportion of tag-specific response. This response was considered undesirable as it will not contribute to protection. For VXB-213 and VXB-221 the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S was found to be 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, while with the bivalent VXB-241 the relative response to MC2S was found to be 4.7% (Fig 2B). In comparison, for the RSV F DSCav1 the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was found to be 19.9%. For the hMPV F DSCavEs2 comparator, which also contains foldon, the geometric mean (GM) of the relative response to foldon was 3.1%. This response was somewhat variable with very low titres for 5 individual mice and relatively high titres for the remaining 3 mice.

This analysis demonstrates that VXB-213, at a dose of 2 µg delivered twice, 3 weeks apart, induces a neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 489; 95%CI = 222–1208). The response to VXB-213 is equivalent to comparator antigen RSV F DSCav1 (GM = 475; 95%CI = 255–946), and approximately 10-fold higher to heat-treated RSV Fsol (GM = 59; 95%CI = 32–125). The analysis of neutralisation against hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) demonstrates that VXB-221 induces a neutralising immune response to hMPV (GM = 1384; 95%CI = 1094–1762). The neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 was 2.5-fold higher than comparator antigen hMPV F DSCavEs2 (GM = 558; 95%CI = 336–971) and approximately 5.5-fold higher to heat-treated hMPV Fsol (GM = 252; 95%CI = 99–778). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 to comparator hMPV F DSCavEs2 showed a highly significant difference (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.0003). The combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 (the selected RSV preF and hMPV preF) antigens mixed prior to injection in mouse, elicited a strong neutralising immune response against both RSV A2 (GM = 329; 95%CI = 171–687) and hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) (GM = 755; 95%CI = 543–1069). A larger scale 50L manufacturing scale production run was performed with the resulting antigens analysed and data compared. For this 50L scale production, stably transfected pools were generated for each antigen. High expression clonal cell lines for VXB-213 and VXB-221 were isolated from CHO K1 stable cell pools and a top clone was selected for production of two specific clonal cell banks. For each antigen an initial production batch was completed at 50L scale to generate material for use in the currently described mouse immunogenicity studies. Production of VXB-213 yielded 1.7 g/L and production of VXB-221 yielded 5.5g/L respectively compared to laboratory scale transient production using the ExpiCHO-S (Thermofisher). This corresponds to production level increases of 70- and 300-fold for VXB-213 and VXB-221, respectively. To assess antigen stability in a liquid formulation over time, a panel of assays was developed. This panel included monitoring for proteolytic degradation by Capillary Electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (CE-SDS), monitoring for the stability of the soluble trimer by Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and use of a capture ELISA based potency test for each antigen. For VXB-213 (RSV preF), the ELISA included the mAbs Motavizumab [41] to capture and AM14 [38] to probe and for VXB-221 (hMPV preF), DS7 [39] to capture and MPE8 [37] to probe. Stability assessment conducted over twelve months with VXB-213 and VXB-221, showed that both antigens retain >99% single product by CE-SDS, > 90% soluble trimer by SE-HPLC and no decrease in reactivity by Potency ELISA (S8 Fig). Material from the RSV preF (VXB-213) 50L batch was biochemically tested by SDS-PAGE alongside the current Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens. As these comparator antigens are distributed as a lyophilised powder, they were first reconstituted in PBS containing 0.05% PS80. Under reducing conditions, the VXB-213 and VXB-241 samples were highly pure with >95% product forming a single band at 60–70 kDa (S7 Fig). Both the Arexvy and Abrysvo antigens produced a major band between the 37 and 50 kDa markers with faint smearing of larger molecular weight products, and a secondary band slightly larger than 20 kDa. This appears to be consistent with near complete furin cleavage of the antigens. In addition to the above, the antigens manufactured at the 50L bioreactor scale were similarly tested for the induction of immunogenicity and neutralisation responses using BALB/c mice. This study involved two immunisations of either 0.5 µg or 3 µg of each antigen (RSVpreF3 from GSK’s RSV vaccine Arexvy, VXB-213, and VXB-221), or with either 1 µg or 6 µg of the combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 mixed prior mouse injection, called here VXB-241. Two doses were given, 3 weeks apart, all adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invitrogen). Three weeks after the second dose, serum was collected and assayed by ELISA to determine total IgG against each antigen, and the ‘tag-specific’ reactivity using an antigen containing either the MC2S domain or the foldon domain with a heterologous ectodomain (Fig 3A). For VXB-213, VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241, the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S for each group ranged between 3.7 and 11.2% (Fig 3B). In comparison, for the Arexvy RSVPreF3 antigen the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was around twice as high at 15.5 and 15.4%.

At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 both stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 5,272; 95%CI = 2,884–10,046 and geomean = 8,453; 95%CI = 4,966–14,894, respectively), which was approximately 6- and 10-fold higher relative to the dose-matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 817; 95%CI = 420–1,710). At the higher dose level of 3 µg of the RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 also stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 6,124; 95%CI = 4,375–8,690 and geomean = 7,534; 95%CI = 5,082–8,690, respectively), which was approximately 2- and 2.5-fold higher relative to the dose matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 2,958; 95%CI = 1,361–6,982). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-213 to the response elicited by the Arexvy antigen showed a significant difference at the 0.5 µg dose level (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.003) but not at the higher dose level of 3 µg (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.13). The equivalent analysis of neutralisation against hMPV preF (Strain CAN97–83) is shown in Fig 3D. At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of hMPV preF antigen, monovalent VXB-221 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (GM = 1,074; 95%CI = 818 - 1,426), however the neutralising immune response was approximately 5-fold lower for the bivalent VXB-241 (GM = 185; 95%CI = 98–380), potentially indicating some interference due to immunodominance of the RSV preF antigen. At the higher dose level of 3 µg of hMPV antigen, both monovalent VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (geomean = 721; 95%CI = 339 - 1,694 and geomean = 519; 95%CI = 235 - 1,288, respectively). Historically, broadly applicable platform technologies for vaccines have saved countless lives. Such platform technologies have included bacterial polysaccharide vaccines (Meningococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus) [42], chemical inactivation of viruses (polio, influenza, rabies, Hepatitis A) and viral attenuation (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Yellow Fever, Varicella) [43]. While successful, the application of these technologies to new targets often took upwards of 5- > 20 years. In recent years, a variety of platform technologies have been established that have significantly streamlined vaccine development and manufacturing. This is most clear in the mRNA vaccine revolution that has been brought forward in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. As there are still several challenges linked to the mRNA vaccines field (high reactogenicity, poor longevity, requirement for frozen storage) [44], having a broader variety of established vaccine platforms that are based on different approaches remains valuable. Here, we have demonstrated that vaccine antigens produced with the Molecular Clamp (MC) platform offer key advantages such as liquid stability and improved immune responses. The MC platform provides the versatility to target diverse viral pathogens. The MC platform is essentially a high stability trimerization domain, similar to previously utilised alternatives GCN4 and Foldon [45,46]. The broadly applicable potential of a first-generation Molecular Clamp based on the HIV-1 gp41 6HB domain was demonstrated in preclinical studies for several viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, and MERS coronavirus [30,31]. In 2020 a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine progressed through Phase 1 clinical trial, with demonstrated safety and good immunogenicity profiles, but was not progressed due to interference with some HIV diagnostic tests, generating false positives [29]. A re-engineered, non-HIV antigen based MC2S sequence, provides the same candidate vaccine attributes, but overcomes the hurdle that prevented progression of MC. The MC2S platform provides high production yield and purity with a universal purification system (AVI-8740 affinity resin), which facilitates rapid advancement through pre-clinical development. For two viral targets (RSV preF and hMPV preF) transient expression yields of 10 – 30 mg/L were achieved with purity above 95% by SDS-PAGE and approximately 90% homogenous trimer by SEC. This level of production comfortably accommodates pre-clinical testing, including in vitro assessment and animal immunisation studies. Furthermore, transition to 50L scale manufacture uses a comparable process regardless of antigen and was able to increase yields to >1 g/L. Production yields such as this with a consistent manufacturing process have the potential to dramatically reduce investment required to achieve commercial scale vaccine production. Following the approval of a first generation of RSV vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13], Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14,16], MRESVIA (Moderna) [15], a large unmet medical need remains with the combined burden of other severe respiratory tract infections amongst highly susceptible populations including newborns, children under 5 years of age, older adult elderly and the immunocompromised. Moreover, there are areas in which the currently approved RSV vaccines can be improved. The two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and the LNP/mRNA vaccine (MRESVIA) is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration [14]. All three current RSV vaccines must be discarded if not used within a defined short period of time. In comparison, our current data show that the MC2S incorporating RSV antigen VXB-213, as well as VXB221 (hMPV preF), are both stable in liquid form at 2–8 °C for > 12 months. This finding supports compatibility with prefilled syringes at 2–8°C. The approved RSV vaccines have been demonstrated to have good protective efficacy, which extends over seasons, however the dose level administered to achieve this protective efficacy is relatively high at 120 µg per dose. This is substantially higher than the 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain included in standard dose influenza vaccines, and higher even than the 60 µg HA per strain included in high dose formulations [47]. We have shown in a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study that VXB-213 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response than the Arexvy RSVpreF3 antigen at the lowest dose levels tested (p = 0.003), likely indicating better presentation of neutralising epitopes to naïve memory B-cells. This result is consistent with previous findings where a fully optimised RSV preF antigen which included the same pair of disulfide bridge stabilisations and optimal deletion within the furin cleavage site was shown to elicit strong neutralisating antibody responses relative to the original RSV preF DsCav1 antigen [33]. VXB-213 incorporates the same ectodomain modifications that are present in this optimised RSV preF antigen. A further complexity exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (for seasonal influenza virus, COVID-19 and RSV). hMPV is another high burden respiratory virus with a comparable incidence rate and severity to RSV in the older adult population [10]. The prospect of adding further vaccines into the annual schedule is a challenge and would likely impact coverage. We have focused on developing liquid stable antigens for both RSV and hMPV to be combined in a bivalent vaccine to reduce burden on healthcare providers and individuals. While there are currently no approved vaccines for hMPV, there have been a wealth of pre-fusion stabilised antigens produced based on the learnings from RSV [21–24]. We chose two of these, DSCavEs2 [21] and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23], to include as comparators for in vitro analysis. Consistent with expectations, prefusion specific nAbs were able to bind with similar affinity to VXB-221 and comparator antigens, while nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 but not the closed pre-fusion stabilised antigen v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C. DSCavEs2 was then included as a positive control within a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study. Here, VXB-221 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response relative to HMPV preF DSCavEs2 (p = 0.0003), however it should be noted that differences in purification methodologies used here and those used by Hseih et al., [22] may have contributed to this difference. The 2.5-fold improvement in elicited neutralising immune response was unexpected given that DSCavEs2 has been highly optimised for stability of the pre-fusion conformation. Monoclonal antibody avidity to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 also appeared to be relatively similar, except for neutralising mAb DS7 which recognises an epitope shared between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. A potential explanation for the improved neutralising immune response may relate to DSCavEs2 being optimised for efficient cleavage at the F1/F2 cleavage site [21], whereas VXB-221 is non-cleaved. It has previously been suggested that F1/F2 cleavage assists in the formation of a stable closed trimer, which was assumed, based on the earlier results for RSV preF would be the optimal antigen for stimulating a neutralizing immune response [23,24]. While nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound with similar affinity to both VXB-221 and DSCavEs2, accessibility to the trimer interface may be different in the context of vaccination. Alternatively, there may be additional neutralising epitopes that are specific to the non-cleaved hMPV preF. Of note, proteolytic cleavage of hMPV preF is inefficient relative to RSV preF [48,49], and timing of cleavage within the viral life cycle has not been well characterised. Contrary to structure-based antigen design focusing on the closed and/or fully cleaved hMPV preF which have included multiple structure stabilising mutations [21–24], VXB-221 is expected to adopt an open and non-cleaved preF conformation. This conformation allows for broad display of neutralising epitopes with minimal modification away from the native sequence. However, we note that monoclonal antibodies targeting the internal interface of the hMPV F protein exhibit varying levels of neutralizing potency. While some, such as M8C10 and MPV465, show modest neutralizing activity, others like MPV-458 demonstrate both high neutralizing potency and cross-reactivity across hMPV strains, highlighting the potential importance of this conserved epitope for vaccine design [28,50]. In mice that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine VXB-241, we observed some reduction in the neutralising immune response to both RSV and hMPV relative to the monovalent vaccines. This effect was particularly evident at the lowest dosage tested, where the neutralising response to hMPV was reduced by 5-fold; this was not seen for RSV. This finding is consistent with the immunodominance of RSV F relative to hMPV F, however it is unknown whether this same phenomenon will be observed in human clinical trials. As with the MC2S platform, approved RSV subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) both include a preF stabilising trimerisation domain [13,14]. The trimer stabilising domain present in Arexvy and Abrysvo RSV preF antigen, is the T4 fibritin sequence-foldon based and the same foldon is also included in RSV preF DSCav1 and hMPV preF DSCavEs2 antigens [21,32]. It has recently been reported that foldon can stimulate an ‘off-target response’ in human vaccine recipients that may negatively impact vaccine potency after repeated administrations [51]. It was recently demonstrated that further stabilisation of the RSV preF ectodomain can facilitate the omission of a trimerization domain thereby eliminating any off-target immune response from this domain [51]. We also recognized the importance of reducing the off-target immune response and achieved this through the incorporation of multiple N-linked glycosylation sites into MC2S. This strategy provides the benefit of easy purification process without drawback of off target response. For each naive mouse immunogenicity study, we calculated the fraction of vaccine elicited IgG that was directed to the T4 fibritin based-foldon or the MC2S trimer stabilising domain, by directly coating antigen to ELISA plates. It should however be noted that direct coating can cause antigen denaturation and so such results may underestimate antigen specific or domain specific IgG responses. Nevertheless we found that typically 10–30% of IgG elicited to foldon containing antigens was specific to the foldon sequence, and therefore unable to contribute to virus neutralisation. This was highly variable and sometimes constituted 40–50% of the elicited IgG response. In comparison, the fraction of IgG directed to the MC2S domain was typically below 10% of the elicited IgG response. Even when mice were immunised with the bivalent VXB-241, in which both antigens contained an identical MC2S domain (with different ectodomains), there was very little overall IgG directed to MC2S. In an ongoing clinical trial by Vicebio, we are exploring the comparative immune responses against the trimerisation domains of both the MC2S containing candidate antigens, and Arexvy as an active comparator (NCT0655614). In summary, the candidate vaccine antigens developed for RSV and hMPV using the second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp platform show high production yield, high liquid stability, and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway to assess safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). The molecular clamp platform technology contributes to the stabilisation of the antigens and offers the potential to advance the development of safe and effective vaccines for prevention of multiple medically important viral diseases. A subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 generated with the non-immunosilenced, MC2 sequence, recently completed Phase 1 trial testing (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05775887) further demonstrating the broad applicability of the proprietary platform. The high yield and consistent production process of MC2S containing candidate vaccine antigens together with the focus on creating liquid stable, multivalent formulations, has the potential to maximise global distribution, improve vaccine compliance, and protect vulnerable populations from medically important respiratory viral diseases. All animal work related to this study was performed in accordance with policies for the proper use and care of animals set by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (AEC numbers: 2021/AE000123, 2021/AE000183, 2021/AE000571, 2023/AE000539). Experiments were designed to minimise animal numbers, and all animals were housed in suitable facilities with ad libitum access to food, water and environmental enrichment. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia by isoflurane inhalation by properly trained personnel. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation. Vaccine antigen coding sequences codon optimised for Cricetulus griseus and synthetic DNA was synthesised in vitro as gblocks (IDT). Antigen coding sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vector pXC-17.4 (Lonza Group, Basel Switzerland) by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stellar Competent Cells (Takara Bio) and screened for correct insertions by colony PCR. Plasmids from selected colonies were isolated and DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence fidelity. Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO-S culture (ThermoFisher) using manufacturer’s instructions. RSV and hMPV antigens were purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using either an affinity column coupled with monoclonal antibody 101F [52] or resin specific to the clamp domain (AVI8740, Avitide, Repligen). Additional antigens were purified by affinity chromatography with either MC (HIV-1 gp41) specific antibody, HIV1281 [53], SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody CR3022 [54], Nipah F virus specific antibody mab66 [55], or influenza H1 virus specific antibody 5J8 [56]. Immunoaffinity columns were prepared by chemical coupling of mAbs to NHS-Activated Sepharose Resing (Cytiva) using manufacturer’s instructions. Antigens were purified using high pH elution from immunoaffinity resin as previously described [30,31]. Affinity purification of MC2S containing antigens was conducted by pre-equilibrating resin with 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 50mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and eluted in 50mM Tris, 1M MgCl2, pH7.4, before then being buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4. Homogeneity of purified proteins was analysed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. Panels of antibodies specific to RSV and MPV F proteins were generated by cloning the antibody variable domains into mab-xpress vectors by previously described methods [57]. The genetic constructs were expressed in CHO-S mammalian culture and purified using a MabSelect Sure affinity column (Cytiva). The variable domain sequences for 101F [52], D25 [36], MPE8 [37], AM14 [38], DS7 [39], MPV458, MPV483, MPV467, MPV487 [40], M8C10 [25], CR3022 [54], mab66 [55], and 5J8 [56] were obtained from public databases. Purified proteins were characterised by standard ELISA using a panel of mAbs described above. Briefly, for RSV antigens ELISA 96-well Maxisorp plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 2 µg/mL of mouse isotype Motavizumab (ref). Plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk diluent (KPL, SeraCare)). Commercially acquired Arexvy (GSK) or Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens were resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and gently mixed to dissolve. Antigens were added to plates coated with capture antibody at 2 µg/mL in blocking buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T, these plates were then probed with a serial dilution of the stated monoclonal antibody, starting at 33.33 nM and serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. After incubating for another hour at 37°C plates were washed as above and bound mAb was detected using goat anti human HRP (ThermoFisher) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. TMB substrate was added and incubated at RT for 3 minutes 30 seconds before the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances were then read at 450 nm. Background absorbances of the full reaction without primary mAb were averaged and subtracted from the respective test absorbance readings. Antigen oligomerisation profiles in solution were assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL resin filtration column (Cytiva). Antigens (40 ug) were applied using a 500 ul sample loop. 50L batches of VXB-213 and VXB-221 were produced using each of the CHO K1 clonal cell lines to produce material for use in a human Phase 1 clinical trial. Briefly, cells were expanded in shake flasks and then a Rocking Motion Bioreactor (Sartorius), before inoculation into 50L HyPerforma Single-Use Bioreactors (ThermoScientific). Production batches were maintained for 14 days with an optimised feed strategy and standard monitoring for growth rate, viable cell density, pH, osmolarity, glucose level, lactate level, ammonia level and carbon dioxide level After the 14-day production run, cell culture supernatant was harvested by two-stage depth filtration and purified by AVI-8740 resin affinity capture, two ion exchange/mix mode column purification steps, viral inactivation with TNBP/PS80, viral nanofiltration and tangential flow filtration (TFF) into the final formulation buffer. Mouse immunisation studies were conducted using female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks of age, housed at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) Animal Facility in the University of Queensland, Australia. Mice were immunised with 0.5 µg, 2 µg or 3 µg per recombinant protein antigen stated (maximum dose 6 µg for bivalent group) with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). Immediately prior to mouse vaccination, the Arexvy antigen vial was resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and then mixed with AddaVax (InvivoGen). Each group (n = 8) was bled via the caudal vein 1 day prior to receiving the first dose (day -1). They were then immunised IM on day 0 and again on day 21 (3 weeks). On day 42 (6 weeks), animals were euthanised and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. The blood was allowed to coagulate overnight at 4°C before centrifugation to isolate the serum. Serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes for use in immunological assays. Mouse IgG titres were determined by standard ELISA as described above with the following deviations. Antigens were coated directly on the ELISA plates at 2 µg/mL and probed with a 1/20 initial dilution of mouse serum that was serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. Following incubation and washing, the bound serum was detected using goat anti mouse HRP (ThermoFisher) at 1:2,000 dilution, before detection and reading as stated above. To determine the total IgG, the serum was tested against the vaccine antigens. To identify ‘tag-specific’ reactivity (i.e., reactivity to either the MC2S domain or foldon domain), the serum was assayed against a Nipah F containing the respective tag. RSV A2 and MPV-GFP1 virus (strain CAN97–83) were propagated on Vero cells and stocks prepared were stored at -80°C. Viral titres were determined using plaque assay [58]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 5 × 104 cells/well in Opti-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After overnight growth to allow a confluent monolayer, serial dilutions of virus stock were prepared in Serum-free Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-Trypsin and 1X Glutamax in the case of MPV. Cell monolayers were inoculated with 50μL of virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After 1 hour incubation, in the case of RSV, the inoculum was topped up with overlay medium (Medium 199 with 1.5% methylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and in the case of MPV, the viral inoculum was removed before topping up with 1.5% CMC media. The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, overlay medium was removed, the cells were fixed (80% acetone) and plaques were immunostained with either RSV specific human IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific human IgG MPV483. The primary antibody staining was followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-human IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2,500). Plaques were read using an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) and titre was recorded as PFU/mL. PRNT assays were performed as previously described [58]. Briefly, mouse sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted 1:10–1:21870. Equal volumes of viral suspension made in inoculum media by addition of virus stock to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL were added to the serum dilution to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:20–1:43,740 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for the virus to be neutralised by serum antibodies. The inoculum media used for RSV was Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while the media used for hMPV was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK and 1X Glutamax. The residual viral infectivity in the sera/virus mixture was assayed by adding the mixture in duplicated to Vero cells monolayer cultivated in 96-well flat bottom plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for virus adsorption to take place. This was directly followed by addition of overlay media in the case of RSV while the viral inoculum was removed before adding 1.5% CMC media in the case of hMPV. The plates were further incubated for 72 hours before fixing the cells with 80% acetone and plaque visualisation by immunostaining as above. PRNT assays for SARS-CoV-2 strain 614G and Influenza virus H1N1pdm A/California09 were conducted with similar methodologies as previously described [31,59]. Nipah virus neutralisation titre was assessed by lentivirus-based pseudo particle assay, as per a method previously described [60]. Human plasma depletion PRNT assays were performed as above. In the case of RSV, human plasma was serially diluted then first incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour either alone or with RSV Fsol, DSCav1 or VXB-213 diluted to 0.5 µg/mL. RSV A2 was then added to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL and again incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixture of virus, human plasma and depletion antigen was then added directly to cells and the PRNT assay performed as above. In the case of hMPV, the presence of antigen within the human plasma depletion PRNT assay had a non-desirable effect of directly blocking viral entry, presumably by receptor binding. Instead, 1.4 mg of VXB-221 or DsCavEs2 were each coupled to 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin (Cytiva), as per manufacturer’s instructions. A control 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin was produced with coupling buffer alone in parallel. The three Sepharose resins (control, VXB-221 and DSCavEs2) were inactivated and washed as per manufacturer’s instructions and then equilibrated with PBS. 1 mL of heat inactivated (HI) human plasma was added to each Sepharose resin and incubated on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature. Antigen depleted and control depleted human plasma were then collected into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and passed through a 0.22 µM filter syringe to ensure sterility and removal of Sepharose beads. Antigen depleted and mock depleted human plasma were then used directly in the hMPV PRNT assay as per mouse sera. Plaque visualisation for human plasma depletion PRNT was completed as above, however with RSV specific mouse IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific mouse IgG MPV483 followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2500). Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.2 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com. Mann Whitney Test was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between treatment groups in neutralising immune response.

Title: Retail sales rebound in June after 2 straight months of declines
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/retail-sales-june-increase-0-6-percent-tariffs-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T13:44:42Z
Full Content:
Consumers picked up their spending in June after an earlier pullback, despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after two consecutive months of spending declines, a 0.1% pullback in April and a 0.9% slowdown in May. Retail was buoyed earlier in the year by car sales as Americans attempted to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. The erratic consumer spending is taking place during a period of mixed signals about the economy as well. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, but the U.S. job market is proving to be very resilient, and major tariffs keep getting postponed. Healthy spending continues, with a heavy focus on necessities, rather than electronics or new appliances. Yet consumers haven’t completely cut out spending on nonessential goods. Sales at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, rose moderately. “Consumers are only feeling a modest amount of pressure from tariffs, and any weakness here is not having much of an effect in forcing them to pull back on more discretionary areas of spending such as restaurants and bars,” wrote William Blair’s macro analyst Richard de Chazal. Yet Chazal fears that the administration may be picking up false assurances from strong consumer spending. Consumer sentiment and markets have tumbled after aggressive tariff announcements, and many economist expect rising prices will have a greater impact on consumers before the year is over. Retail sales in June included a 1.2% gain in sales of autos and auto parts. Spending expanded across most major categories including clothing and personal care. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Electronics and appliance retailers, furniture stores and department stores all saw sales declines. The products sold in these sectors are heavily imported. A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet,” said Long in a statement. “There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. Business owners say it’s become very difficult to manage supplies and inventories. Americans, when they do shop, are generally steering clear of the things they don’t absolutely need. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation data makes it increasingly likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are for at least a bit longer. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices before reducing borrowing costs. A notable litmus test about the state of the consumer was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. And again, those who were spending prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the big retail events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June showing resilience despite anxiety high over tariffs and the U.S. economy WASHINGTON -- After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase. There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet," said Long in a statement. "There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. For businesses, that has made it harder to manage supply and inventories. Americans are focusing more on necessities, when they do shop. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs. Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes. One big litmus test was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Uber is turning to Lucid as it looks to play catch-up in the robotaxi wars. More than four and a half years after Uber sold off its autonomous vehicle division, the company is investing $300 million into Lucid as part of a new robotaxi deal. Lucid will make the vehicles for Uber's robotaxis, based on its Gravity EV. Uber is also partnering with self-driving technology company Nuro, which will power the autonomous driving capabilities. Uber expects the tech to launch "later next year in a major US city." "Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. "We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world." Lucid's stock price jumped more than 43% in pre-market trading following news of the partnership, while Uber's stock price was slightly up before the opening bell. Uber said it plans to deploy a fleet of 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. The company said its first prototype is "already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds." The robotaxi wars have been heating up over the last year, with market leader Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operating autonomous rides in multiple states. Tesla launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi program in Austin earlier this summer. While the cars drive themselves, Tesla employees still ride in the vehicles with passengers for safety reasons. Lyft also plans to launch rides with AVs in Dallas as soon as next year, TechCrunch reported in February. Uber agreed to sell its autonomous vehicle division to startup Aurora in December 2020. At the time, it was grappling with a pandemic-induced downturn in its ride-hailing business. Since then, Uber has offered rides in autonomous vehicles in Atlanta and Austin through a partnership with Waymo. Riders can request a ride in an AV through Uber's app in those cities. If adopted widely, robotaxis would present a way for Uber and other ridesharing services to bypass human drivers. In January, Khosrowshahi said that Uber doesn't expect robotaxis to replace the company's gig-worker drivers for the next decade. Do you have a story to share about gig work?

Title: Apple Inks $500M Deal With the Only US Rare Earth Miner Amid US-China Trade War

Apple is teaming up with MP Materials, the only rare earth miner in the U.S., to build a $500 million plant in Texas that will recycle and manufacture rare earth magnets—key components used in everything from iPhones to fighter jets. The move comes as the U.S. looks to bring more of its tech supply chain back home and reduce its reliance on China, which currently dominates global rare earth processing. These minerals have been making headlines lately, not just for their role in cutting-edge tech, but also as flashpoints in rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The new facility will feature neodymium magnet production lines tailored to Apple’s specific hardware needs. It’s part of Apple’s broader plan to invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over four years. MP Materials expects to begin shipping magnets to Apple as early as 2027. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. Rare earth magnets are critical for a wide range of products, from iPhones and electric vehicles to fighter jets and missile guidance systems. Yet the U.S. has historically depended on China for nearly all rare earth processing. While these minerals are not rare geologically, they are expensive and complex to process, and China currently controls about 92 percent of global output. Apple’s announcement follows a major move by the U.S. Department of Defense, which last week made a $400 million investment in MP Materials as part of a landmark public-private partnership. The Pentagon purchased a new class of convertible preferred shares along with a 10-year warrant at $30.03 per share. If fully exercised, the government could hold a roughly 15 percent stake in the company—more than major shareholders like BlackRock or co-founder James Litinsky. Funds from the Defense Department will go toward building another magnet plant, which will produce a new class of “10X” magnets. The Pentagon has committed to purchasing 100 percent of that output over the next decade. That facility is expected to open in 2028 and will boost MP Materials’ annual magnet capacity to 10,000 metric tons—enough to meet a significant share of U.S. demand. Apple, meanwhile, has already begun reducing its dependence on newly mined rare earths by prioritizing recycled materials. By 2023, the company reported that about two-thirds of the aluminum, three-fourths of the rare earth elements and 95 percent of the tungsten used in its products came from recycled sources. That same year, Apple also pledged to use only recycled cobalt in its batteries going forward. The moves by Apple and the Pentagon are part of a broader U.S. push to nearshore rare earth supply chains. Earlier this year, President Trump proposed annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory estimated to contain $4.4 trillion worth of rare earth reserves. Vice President JD Vance made a surprise visit in support of the plan. Meanwhile, rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have underscored the strategic importance of rare earth independence. In April, China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals bound for the U.S. The controls were lifted on May 11 as part of a 90-day trade truce, but the episode highlighted the risks of continued reliance on China for such critical materials.

Title: Wall Street’s AI Bubble Is Worse Than the 1999 Dot-com Bubble, Warns a Top Economist
URL: https://gizmodo.com/wall-streets-ai-bubble-is-worse-than-the-1999-dot-com-bubble-warns-a-top-economist-2000630487

Back in 1999, Wall Street lost its collective mind over the internet. Companies with no revenue were suddenly worth billions, “eyeballs” were treated as currency, and market analysts predicted a frictionless future where everything would be digital. Then the bubble burst. Between March 2000 and October 2002, an estimated five trillion dollars in market value vanished into thin air. Today, it is happening again. This time, the magic word is not â.com.â It is âAI.â According to Torsten Slok, the influential chief economist at Apollo Global Management, a major global investment firm, the current AI driven market bubble is even more stretched than the dot com frenzy of the late 1990s. And he has the data to prove it. âThe difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,â Slok wrote in a recent research note that was widely shared across social media and financial circles. The chart from Apollo compares the 12 month forward price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. In plain English, a P/E ratio measures how expensive a stock is by comparing its price to its profits. A high P/E ratio means investors are paying a premium and are betting on strong future growth. Slok’s chart reveals something stunning: in 2025, the P/E ratios of the top ten companies are even higher than they were at the absolute peak of the dot com bubble in 2000. Torsten Slok: "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s" pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 16, 2025 This means investors are betting so aggressively on AI giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Google that their stock prices have become detached from their actual earnings, even more so than tech darlings like Cisco and AOL were in the nineties. The top 10 companies driving this frenzy, which hold the most significant market value on Wall Street, include tech titans like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta. It is a super concentrated AI frenzy that is pushing a handful of mega cap stocks into nosebleed territory. You have probably heard that the S&P 500 is performing well this year. Here is the uncomfortable truth: most of those gains are coming from just those ten companies. The other 490 companies in the index are barely moving. This kind of narrow rally is incredibly risky. It means the health of the entire stock market is dependent on the performance of a very small number of firms. If Nvidia sneezes, the entire market could catch a cold. The problem is that Wall Street is treating AI as if it has already fulfilled every promise, from a productivity revolution to trillion dollar cost savings. The potential is being priced as a certainty, even though most of those gains have not yet materialized. In 1999, the internet was real. It did change everything. But that fact did not stop investors from wildly overpaying for companies that could not deliver on the hype. The parallels with todayâs AI excitement are chilling. Every corporate earnings call now dutifully mentions an “AI strategy,” just like every company in 1999 slapped on a â.comâ to its name. Stocks are surging on the vague potential of AI, not necessarily on real, current revenue. Wall Street is pricing in a perfect AI future without acknowledging the enormous risks: regulatory crackdowns, staggering compute costs, model hallucinations, or simply a slower than expected adoption rate. As Slokâs chart shows, the market is pricing these top ten AI heavy firms as if they are invincible. That is never a good sign. This is not a question of whether AI will change the world. It will, just as the internet did. The real question is how much investors are willing to pay today for profits that might not arrive for years, if ever. If history teaches us anything, it is that bubbles do not pop because the technology is fake. They pop when investor expectations dramatically outpace reality and the flow of easy money dries up. The more Wall Street bets on AI perfection, the more fragile this market rally becomes. If corporate earnings do not catch up to these sky high valuations, and soon, the market may not even need a specific trigger to deflate. The valuations alone could do the job. And when bubbles pop, they do not do so politely. They implode, wiping out trillions in value and shattering investor trust in the process. The technology called AI will certainly survive. The top ten companies likely will too. But the portfolios chasing this dream without a parachute might not. Just like in 2000, when it seemed the internet had made financial gravity obsolete, the AI hype train is speeding toward a cliff it thinks it can fly over.

Environmental and Native American activists rally to shut down the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline, which runs under the Straits of Mackinac, in Detroit, Michigan. The deep connections between Line 5 and Gaza serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for united, organized resistance to defend justice, the land, and human and nonhuman life. In the United States, we are fighting a rapid descent into authoritarianism that is already having disastrous consequences for people, communities, and the environment. At the same time, grassroots movements across the globe are fighting to defend life, water, and land. These fights may seem worlds apart, but they are in fact intertwined at their roots. Here we will explore two examples that are not unique, but have been chosen because they make visible the underlying structural and political forces that link seemingly disparate struggles across the world. We believe that recognizing these links is necessary for building the powerful coalitions we need to resist in these critical times. In Wisconsin, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa—a sovereign Indigenous nation—is leading a battle that resonates far beyond its borders. In coalition with local, national, and international organizations and activists, the Band is saying no to the exploitation of its land and people by fossil fuel giants; saying no to pipelines that endanger waterways, wetlands, and wild rice beds essential to their culture and survival; and saying no to fossil fuel extraction that accelerates the climate crisis. At the heart of this struggle lies Enbridge’s Line 5—a 645-mile pipeline transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids from Wisconsin to Ontario. Line 5 does not stand alone but is linked to a much larger network of pipelines that begin in the tar sands fields of Canada and transport one of the dirtiest forms of fossil fuel. The aging Line 5 cuts directly through the Bad River Band’s reservation, but easements for this pipeline expired in 2013. Enbridge now plans to reroute the pipeline around the reservation despite years of legal battles and overwhelming public opposition. Enbridge has a well-documented history of spills and environmental destruction and, as an investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, supported the violent attacks on Indigenous activists at Standing Rock. Enbridge’s reroute of Line 5 remains a direct threat to fragile ecosystems and Indigenous sovereignty. At the same time, thousands of miles away, millions of Palestinians are being displaced and tens of thousands killed by an all-out military assault in Gaza that targets the entire population and infrastructure for life. This is accompanied by accelerating state-supported violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. The relentless bombings, mass displacement, deliberate starvation, and destruction of civilian life carried out by Israel and the U.S. against the Palestinian people amounts not to a conventional war but to genocide. The U.S. and Israel are now openly discussing a plan to permanently remove Palestinians and take over Gaza and the West Bank, completing a process of ethnic cleansing that has been ongoing for over 100 years. What links a battle over a pipeline in Wisconsin to the crisis in Gaza and the West Bank? Everything. The fight against Line 5 isn’t merely about fossil fuels—it’s a stand against a global system of colonialism, militarism, and capitalism that drives the climate crisis. The ethnic cleansing and genocide directed at Palestinians represent the advancement of a long-term colonial project that uses violence and militarism to secure access to land and resources. In a critical moment when we face a rising tide of fascism in the U.S. and abroad, the deep connections between Line 5 and Gaza serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for united, organized resistance to defend justice, the land, and human and nonhuman life. Colonialism is about dominance and control. Whether imposed on Indigenous nations in the United States or on Palestinians abroad, its purpose is to grant powerful states and corporations unfettered access to land and resources, fueling profits and increased power for ruling elites. In Gaza—and increasingly in the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and Syria—the brutal legacy of settler colonialism is on display. Since at least 1947, Israel has pursued colonization in Palestine, displacing native inhabitants and instituting an apartheid system to control those who remain. Military force and state-sponsored violence have systematically stripped Palestinians of their land, water, property, and freedom, a process bolstered by political, financial, and military support from Western powers. In particular, Israel is critical to strategic U.S. military and political presence in the Middle East; in other words, it is central to U.S. imperialism. The current crisis in Gaza is an escalation of this long-term project. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. The systems at work in Gaza are the same as those that drive projects like Line 5. The history of the U.S. is one of colonial expansion, of violently appropriating land and resources from native inhabitants and transferring it to the U.S. government and settlers. Even now, the U.S. government and powerful corporate interests ignore the rights of Indigenous sovereign nations and ram through pipelines, mines, and other projects despite their environmental and social dangers and opposition from tribes. Projects like Line 5 are a continuation of a multi-century colonial project that stretches from from the Indian Wars in the 19th century to the militarized response to the Indigenous-led resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. Whether it manifests through violent repression of protest or the displacement of entire ethnic groups, the same colonial logic is at work. Israel’s occupation and blockade of Gaza aims to secure access to land, water, and offshore natural gas reserves for themselves and their corporate and political allies. The same drive for control and access to resources underpins Line 5, linking these two struggles in a broader fight against colonialism, exploitation, and global corporate power. Militarism fuels colonialism. It is also essential to the fossil fuel industry, the core driver of the climate crisis. The U.S. military extends across an estimated 750 overseas bases in 80 countries. This web of influence props up transnational fossil fuel networks that depend on protection and the threat of force to extract and transport oil and gas around the globe. The paramilitary response to activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline and Line 3 in Minnesota are local examples that illustrate this relationship. The U.S. invests $800 billion into the military each year, money that could be spent on the public good but is instead used to underwrite a global system of extraction and exploitation. The U.S. military also contributes to the climate crisis in more direct ways. The U.S. Department of Defense is the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels and is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than many nations. Wars and conflict contribute significantly to carbon emissions and also drive widespread environmental devastation that destroys local livelihoods. U.S. military bases are ranked as among the most polluted in the world, damaging land and water in surrounding areas with past nuclear testing and toxic chemicals. Militarism is also deeply intertwined with corporate interests. Big defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Oshkosh Defense, and Raytheon profit from the devastation in Gaza. Such contractors are also deeply intertwined with private security firms like Blackrock. These security firms are deployed by fossil fuel companies to protect fossil fuel infrastructure projects like Line 5, harming Indigenous communities and intensifying climate collapse. In short, the U.S. military reinforces a system that prizes profit over human life. The struggles in Gaza and against Line 5 are two sides of the same coin. Palestinians resisting occupation and Indigenous nations opposing pipelines face the same force: militarized, transnational government-corporate alliances. Their fight is not solely for their own physical and cultural survival—it is a battle for justice and freedom for all people and the planet. The climate crisis is inseparable from the forces of militarism, colonialism, and capitalism. Climate change is also contributing to a related crisis—the rise of fascism and the demonization of immigrants. As global temperatures climb, environmental disasters and unpredictability increase, contributing to economic destabilization and a general sense of uncertainty and fear. This creates an ideal breeding ground for fascist ideologies that promise greater security (for some) through the exercise of state control, brute strength, and the scapegoating of the vulnerable—all while siphoning money and power to corporations. Climate change also drives the displacement of people, as extreme heat, flooding, drought, and other environmental disasters force entire regions into unlivable conditions. In 2022 alone, over 43 million people were displaced by climate-related events, from hurricanes and floods to shifts in agricultural viability. This number is set to grow, creating an ever-growing wave of climate refugees. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. Rather than addressing the root causes of climate change, developing plans for adaptation that serve the public good, or offering refuge to those forced to migrate, many governments worldwide are responding with authoritarian measures. Fascist leaders paint climate refugees as threats, blaming migrants and marginalized communities for crises they did not create. In the U.S., we see this in the criminalization of immigration, mass deportation, the expansion of border walls, and the deployment of surveillance technologies—many of which were first developed in Israel and tested on Palestinians. These policies only worsen human suffering while deflecting attention from the real culprits: fossil fuel corporations, militarism, and capitalist greed. These rising authoritarian impulses are deeply linked to the fight against Line 5 and resistance to Israel’s expansion. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. The November 2024 election and turn toward fascism in the U.S. have underscored the urgency of grassroots resistance. Corporate and right-wing forces are aligning in unprecedented ways, fueled by economic inequality, xenophobia, fear, and disinformation. Authoritarian regimes in the U.S. and abroad, including Israel, are poised to further expand corporate power, fossil fuel extraction, militarism, and state oppression in frightening ways. This convergence poses an escalating threat to human communities and the natural world. The fight against Line 5, led by the Bad River Band, and the global solidarity movement for Palestine both stand at the forefront of grassroots resistance to these converging forces. Broadening our lens, we can see such resistance taking place all over the world: in the anti-pipeline struggles in East Africa, the efforts of Indigenous communities in the Amazon to protect their land and way of life, and the bravery of anti-mining activists in El Salvador, to name just a few examples. These movements remind us that these battles in specific places are part of a broader struggle against interconnected systems of oppression—something that has long been recognized by local communities and Indigenous-led organizations worldwide. Our organizing must be both intersectional and international. We must connect struggles that have too often been treated in isolation. The same forces that drive the expansion of Line 5 and the attacks on Palestinian life are at work in militarized occupations and conflicts abroad, the construction of border walls and the criminalization of migrants, and the climate crisis itself. By challenging these forces at home, and acting in solidarity with those abroad, we strike at the roots of a global system of exploitation and oppression. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. We must forge alliances with diverse movements from Wisconsin to East Africa to the Philippines, recognizing that we succeed or fail together. Despite these dangerous and difficult times, a different world is possible when we unite and act as one. In the United States, we are fighting a rapid descent into authoritarianism that is already having disastrous consequences for people, communities, and the environment.

Bitcoin price is once again heading toward the $120,000 mark, but the big question traders are asking is—what will it take for Bitcoin to reach $150,000? Driven by a $1 billion futures short squeeze, strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, and growing institutional interest, BTC’s momentum is building. Support from Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, potential passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a $143K target all fuel the rally. With Cantor Fitzgerald eyeing a 30,000 BTC acquisition and inflation data stabilizing, Bitcoin could be ready for its next breakout toward $130K and ultimately $150K. Bitcoin is heating up again — and this time, analysts are setting their sights on a massive $150,000 target. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has surged past $120,000, gaining over 28% in just the past 30 days and reigniting hopes of a new all-time high. According to data from CoinShares, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $14.8 billion in net inflows since May, marking one of the strongest periods of institutional adoption in crypto history. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence and ARK Invest now forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000–$200,000 by early 2026, with some more aggressive models predicting a run to $250K if market conditions remain favorable.

Δ The goal, as The New York Times (NYT) reported Thursday (July 17), is to benefit from the rising demand for electricity from data centers. Among the investment groups engaged in this effort is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which wants to acquire Minnesota Power. That utility owns several power plants and thousands of miles of power lines that could help artificial intelligence (AI) companies secure energy for their data centers. However, this deal is facing pushback, with a state administrative law judge recommending this week late Tuesday that Minnesota utility regulators deny the proposed acquisition. Another investment group, private equity firm Blackstone, announced an agreement in May to purchase Albuquerque-based TXNM Energy, which provides electricity to 800,000 residential and business customers in New Mexico and Texas. These efforts have drawn criticism from consumer and progressive groups, who argue investment firms shouldn’t own electric utilities as they typically want to maximize profits, often by burdening the company’s finances with debt. This approach, the critics argue, could lead to much higher rates and worse service. “No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms,” said Nichole Heil, senior researcher and campaign director for climate at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. The report notes that electricity rates are rising around the country, in part because of upgrades to address climate change, and in part because of increased demand from AI data centers. The news comes days after the announcement that Google, Meta, Blackstone and CoreWeave were planning to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to construct new AI data centers Google told PYMNTS Tuesday (July 15) that it plans to spend $25 billion over the next two years on data centers and AI infrastructure in the PJM electric grid region, a coverage area that runs from New Jersey to North Carolina and Illinois to the nation’s capital. “Google’s investments announced today will increase energy abundance and empower Americans with the skills needed to thrive in the AI era,” Alphabet and Google President Ruth Porat said in a statement provided to PYMNTS. One day earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on a Facebook post that his company would invest “hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence.” Compute refers to computational power, covering chips, servers and connectivity in data centers.

Title: India Asset Management – Key drivers and trends (Anusha Sivaramakrishnan)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28920/india-asset-management--key-drivers-and-trends
Time Published: 2025-07-17T11:04:26Z
Full Content:
Overview The Indian asset management industry has witnessed remarkable growth over the past decade, driven by an increasing awareness of financial planning, a surge in retail participation, and robust economic expansion. This sector, which encompasses mutual funds, portfolio management services, and alternative investment funds, has become a pivotal part of India's financial landscape with a total AUM of ~₹117 or $1.3 trillion. With the asset management industry growing 6x in the last decade, the outlook also looks positive with growth in mutual fund expected at CAGR of 14%, portfolio management services and alternative investment funds at CAGR of 26% till 2028. In the last decade (from FY14 to FY25), the PMS and AIF markets have been growing at a rate of 33% per year. As India aspires to have $35 trillion economy size by 2047 and enters its next phase of rapid development, PMSes and AIFs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for HNIs and UHNIs, seeking more personalized and higher-yielding investment options. This point of view explores the emerging trends and growth trajectory of the asset management industry with a specific focus on mutual funds. Key trends in mutual funds The India Mutual Fund Industry is expected to reach USD 0.78 trillion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of greater than 18% to reach USD 1.78 trillion by 2030. Millennials and Gen Z are increasingly interested in mutual funds because they are more likely to embrace technology and digital tools for investing. There is also an increased focus on expansion into smaller towns and rural areas by offering micro- investing which is as low as INR 500. Tier 2 and tier 3 cities now account for more than 35% of new SIP registrations, demonstrating the widening geographic spread of Indian mutual funds. Women investors now represent approximately 33% of new mutual fund accounts, showing improved gender diversity in the Indian financial market. With tools like mobile apps, robo-advisors, and data analytics, investors can manage their portfolios in real time and track their investments with ease. The use of technology makes mutual funds more accessible to the average Indian investor, who can now easily invest and track their portfolio from the comfort of their home. Partnerships between AMCs, fintech companies, and technology providers help in creating digital platforms that can offer a wide range of financial services in one place and build platforms that offer superior customer service, including faster onboarding, online transaction capabilities, better customer grievance resolution, efficient and timely dashboards. At the same time, digital payment systems make it easier to transfer funds and complete transactions. DSP Asset Managers has joined hands with Cybrilla to become one of the first mutual fund companies to go live on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The Network’s open design lets more distributors, including local entrepreneurs and fintech startups—offer mutual funds to a wider audience. Because ONDC Network is decentralized, DSP and its partners can create new investment products like daily SIPs or goal-based micro-investments. Newer thematic funds have adopted increasingly focused, narrow ideas. From housing, defense and manufacturing, NFOs have moved on to target themes like tourism, electric vehicles, rural opportunities, conglomerates, among other flavours. Among the latest offerings, funds are targeting ideas like Railway PSUs and premium consumption. . In India, the ESG theme is also gaining popularity, and a few fund houses have launched ESG-thematic funds. India's passive mutual fund AUM surged 21% YoY to ₹11.13 lakh crore in March 2025, with equity ETFs and index funds dominating the landscape. Passive funds now account for 16.7% of the overall mutual fund industry AUM, reflecting a growing shift towards index-linked strategies. The growth in passive AUM over the past year underlines a shift in investor preference towards low-cost, rule-based investment vehicles. While equity ETFs and index funds dominate the landscape, the performance of debt and commodity passive funds presents a nuanced picture of evolving investor sentiment and market conditions. Recently Jio BlackRock has received approval from India's markets regulator to launch five passive index funds. Key drivers for growth Financial literacy initiatives and campaigns by industry bodies like AMFI (Sahi hai, Bharat Nivesh Yatra etc) are playing a crucial role in educating investors about the benefits of mutual funds which is a significant factor for choosing mutual funds as an investment option among retail investors. Online platforms and mobile apps (Zerodha and Groww (1+ crore total users) have simplified the investment process, making it more convenient for retail investors, especially the younger generation. These platforms simplify investment journeys with features such as goal-based investing, real-time portfolio tracking and personalized recommendations, empowering investors to make informed and independent decisions. Declining interest rates on traditional savings instruments like fixed deposits have encouraged investors to explore higher-yielding options like stock markets. India’s total demat account is expected to cross 18 crores by Nov 2024 – growing by over 4 crores in 2024 alone. NSE recorded the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in Asia for the calendar year 2024 (CY24), with a total of 268 listings across its mainboard and SME platform. The trend is expected to continue in 2025; will enhance investor options. SEBI has permitted investments in new asset classes like REITs, InVITs, Gold and silver ETFs, expanding the investment options available to mutual funds. Alternative assets market in India is expected to grow 5X to USD 2 Tn by 2034. Alternative investments outperform traditional investment options, offering higher alpha, attracting increased interest from India’s HNI and UHNI segments SEBI has been instrumental in promoting transparency and lower costs in the mutual fund industry. Some of the regulations include the recent Mutual Fund Lite Regulations (2024) to bring compliance, new regulations seeking a clear segregation of offshore derivative instruments (ODIs) and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mandated more disclosures to reduce systemic risks in India's capital market relaxations for the passively managed schemes. Key challenges for fund houses Low financial literacy in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and a preference for traditional, more straightforward and perceived-safer options, such as fixed deposits, PPFs, and gold, hindered broader adoption. Similar challenges exist in the rural areas with the added factor of linguistic hindrances and lack of digital knowledge limiting the usage of digital platforms. There is more focus on the B-30 cities to attract investments, which has resulted in growth up to 40% in those cities. Severe market corrections and inherent volatility of equity markets have been major deterrents for casual retail investors from investing in mutual funds due to uncertain market returns. High investment costs in terms of total expense ratios due to exit loads, management fees and commissions are also additional challenges. Stable alternatives like public provident fund (PPF) also reduced the investments. HDFC Mutual Fund recently announced a hike in the Total Expense Ratio (TER) for its Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund from 0.67% to 0.73%. Despite increasing awareness mutual funds has limited set of AMFI distributors concentrated mainly in metropolitan areas. This has led to smaller investors and rural investors to take a cautious approach due to lack of advisory support and lack of confidence in investing independently in equity linked investments. Apart from the regular banks, another intriguing development is the inclusion of 18 boutique Mutual Fund Distributor (MFD) firms in the list of top 100. These boutique MFD firms are notably supported by individual MFDs, indicating a growing presence of niche, independent players. Although the mutual fund industry has made considerable progress in standardizing processes, a few challenges persist. These include simplifying the KYC procedures to ensure hassle-free onboarding, allowing Aadhaar to be used interchangeably with PAN, and enabling investments based on “Bank KYC”. The data localization requirements and cost sensitivity of Indian markets also hurt foreign fund houses. Only six of the Top 20 Asset Management companies in India are foreign owned fund houses. Among these, Invesco formed a joint venture with IndusInd International Holdings Limited (IIHL) by selling off 60% stake in 2024 and notable is the Jio Blackrock joint venture. The mutual fund companies are finding it difficult to expand into different businesses due to Clause 24 of the mutual fund regulation dealing with the issues pertaining to business activities that AMCs can take. The regulation mandates AMCs not to undertake business activities that are in conflict of interest with the core business of managing mutual fund schemes. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is reviewing its mutual fund regulations, including the scheme categorization framework and restrictions on asset management company (AMC) activities to simplify compliance and reduce regulatory burden. The growth trajectory At least six new fund houses have in-principle approval to set up the mutual fund business which includes big names like Jio Blackrock, Capital mind etc. While new entrants like Jio BlackRock plan to cater to all segments of the mutual fund business — including active, passive, and smart-beta strategies — and offer products across equity, debt, and hybrid categories, others are adopting a more focused approach. Some of the fund houses plan to exclusively offer passive funds, meanwhile others plan to concentrate on factor-based and quantitative investing strategies. Therefore, identifying the right theme is crucial for success. To attract NRI/foreign investments or overseas investments from India, many foreign FIs have set up branches in GIFT City. DSP Mutual Fund’s Global equity fund is the first open ended mutual fund for retail investors under the GIFT city which allows Indian residents to invest in a diversified portfolio of global equities. US-based State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management division of State Street Corporation, has established a strategic relationship with small case, a provider of model portfolios and investment platforms in India’s capital markets. The collaboration will enable SSGA to distribute its Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) ETFs through small case’s digital investment platform, opening up avenues for Indian investors to access global markets. Thus, foreign fund houses find it beneficial to partner with Indian Financial Institutions (Fis) to launch Asset Management Products. Anticipated advancements in fintech and AI will continue to reshape the mutual fund industry, offering innovative solutions for investors. Collaboration between AMCs, fintech startups, and technology providers will drive the expansion of integrated digital platforms, providing holistic financial solutions. Moreover, the proliferation of digital payment systems and open banking initiatives will facilitate seamless fund transfers and transaction processing, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of mutual fund services. Ensuring data privacy and protection is paramount, requiring continuous investment in cybersecurity measures and regulatory compliance initiatives. RTAs (Registrar and Transfer Agents) are the operational backbone of the mutual fund industry. RTAs leverage automation, enabling AMCs to scale operations efficiently while ensuring error-free processing and reliable services. This has significantly reduced operational costs and enhanced efficiency for AMCs, allowing them to cater to the market’s growing demands. RTAs also provide centralized digital platforms, offering investors real-time access to portfolios, transaction histories and account details, enhancing transparency and convenience. Women investors are increasingly making their mark in the mutual fund space, with their share of investments growing significantly over the past five years. According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), women now hold 33% of the total individual investor assets under management (AUM) as of March 2024. Conclusion In summary, the growth trajectory remains strong with 6x increase measured by AUM over the last decade or so is attributed to the concerted efforts of all stakeholders of the ecosystem. AMCs developed innovative products and made them attractive for average investors (SIPs, FoFs, ETFs, etc.); technological interventions such as digital-first platforms by new-age players and digital tools and infrastructure were established by RTAs to streamline onboarding, settlement, record-keeping and servicing; campaigns were created to drive customer awareness and distribution reach by AMFI (MF Sahi Hai, MFD Shuru Karein); and regulatory interventions were imposed around product simplicity, affordability, democratization and sustainability.

Title: You’re Not Imagining It: AI Is Already Taking Tech Jobs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/07/17/ai-tech-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T10:30:00Z

ByRichard Nieva ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Between meetings in April, Micha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn’t mince words: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too,” he wrote. “This is a wakeup call.” The memo detailed Kaufman’s thesis for AI — that it would elevate everyone’s abilities: Easy tasks would become no-brainers. Hard tasks would become easy. Impossible tasks would become merely hard, he posited. And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. In the shuffle, people who didn’t adapt would be “doomed.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me — that they aren’t imagining stuff.” Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate; the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. It isn’t just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going forward; Chen notes too that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring,” said Chen, adding that companies are starting to focus more on employing experts in their fields. “The superstar workers are in a better position.” Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR company ADP, to examine generative AI’s impact on the workforce. The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century. Now suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers, rather than replace them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” over the next few years as the company begins to “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can’t be automated by AI. Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and automation. At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had slashed its workforce 40%, in part due to investments in AI. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring. The superstar workers are in a better position.” Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its workforce. The company didn’t explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech. Automating customer service at call centers alone, for example, saved more than half a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written by AI. “This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities,” one laid off Microsoft employee told Forbes. Microsoft didn’t respond to questions about the reasons behind its layoffs, but said in a statement: “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company. The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff plans. Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still be trying to correct for overhiring. According to one report released earlier this month by the executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, AI may be more of a scapegoat than a true culprit for layoffs: Of more than 286,000 planned layoffs this year, only 20,000 were related to automation, and of those, only 75 were explicitly attributed to artificial intelligence, the firm found. Plus, it’s challenging to measure productivity gains caused by AI, said Stanford’s Chen, because while not every employee may have AI tools officially at their disposal at work, they do have unauthorized consumer versions that they may be using for their jobs. While the technology is beginning to take a toll on developers in the tech industry, it’s actually “modestly” created more demand for engineers outside of tech, said Chen. That’s because other sectors, like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, are adopting AI tools for the first time, so they are adding engineers to their ranks in larger numbers than before, according to her research. Automating jobs has its limits, too. Last year, Klarna said that the company’s AI tools were doing the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents. But a year later, the company seemed to reverse course, announcing a recruitment drive to hire more human agents. CEO Siemiatkowski has denied the new hiring push meant the company was pulling back on AI. Instead, he said the new human agents would handle more of the higher-end conversations the company had previously outsourced. Siemiatkowski was not available for an interview, but Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom defended the strategy. “We rely on AI just as much,” she said in a statement. “However, we have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” she continued, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Klarna’s experiments show that deciphering which tasks are more suitable for humans, and which can be entrusted to machines, is an open question. Siemiatkowski has been one of the most vocal proponents of automation: to prove the point, when Klarna announced first-quarter earnings in May, he didn’t even show up. Instead, he arranged for an AI deepfake of himself to give the financial update and trumpet a profitable three months. The upside to the upheaval, Fiverr’s Kaufman said, is that people seem willing to learn. (The company hasn’t done any AI-related layoffs or hiring freezes, he told Forbes.) In his memo to employees, he said he would hold office hours to discuss the changing AI landscape with anyone who wanted to chat. He booked a conference room for 50 people. To his surprise, he showed up to find 250 employees waiting for him. “So it was just, ‘All right, let’s do this,’” Kaufman said. He told employees they needed to be proactive to learn new AI techniques, and not just wait to be taught. “I'm going to help anyone who is motivated to help themselves.”

Title: Vanguard Made a Single Acquisition. Now, It’s Getting Sued
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/advisor/industry-news/vanguard-made-a-single-acquisition-now-its-getting-sued/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T10:10:00Z
Full Content:
The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Vanguard made its first acquisition in 2021, but by the looks of it, it may just be the last. The Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm is now facing a lawsuit stemming from the purchase of JustInvest, one of a handful of direct indexing platforms that were all the rage back in the early 2020s. The complaint alleges the world’s second-largest money manager acted in bad faith post-sale by thwarting certain business deals that would have led to payouts for JustInvest founders and shareholders. Even today, Vanguard investors aren’t able to use the service, which was rebranded Vanguard Personalized Indexing Management, nor can the firm’s in-house advisors, according to Jeff DeMaso, editor of the newsletter the Independent Vanguard Advisor. So, why the acquisition in the first place? “Perhaps it was a move to defend the firm against the risk that direct indexing would replace index mutual funds and ETFs,” DeMaso said. “If that was the goal, sure, mission accomplished. But that’s a low hurdle.” The suit alleges that Vanguard blocked deals that would have led to performance payments, which represented a “large share” of compensation to JustInvest’s founders. In one instance, JustInvest was close to landing $900 million in assets but Vanguard management allegedly put the kibosh on the deal without an explanation. Before the acquisition, however, Vanguard insisted there would be “lines out the door” for their direct indexing service and that it could help bring in $1 billion in assets to JustInvest on Day 1 alone, according to the complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court. “Indeed, before the merger closed, Vanguard expressed concerns that the security-holders would earn the full performance payments under the agreement too quickly,” the suit said. The complaint also alleges the three founders — Jonathan Hudacko, Vijay Rao, and Alan Cummings — were terminated last year without cause in retaliation for raising concerns. Vanguard declined to comment. Direct Hit. Who can forget when direct indexers were hot commodities in the early 2020s as experts predicted the platforms, which help clients build their own, personalized indexes that come with significant tax advantages, could even take over the ETF industry itself? The laundry list of proud new index shop owners included BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, to name just a few. “[Acquisitions] are not easy, no matter which seat you are in,” DeMaso said. “But this has not been a win-win coming together. Said differently, Vanguard is 0 for 1 on acquisitions … at least from the viewpoint of the acquired.” ETFs targeting the sector are riding high this year due to sustained conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. Growth across the RIA industry remains robust, but AI helps top performers stand apart from the crowd, according to a new Schwab report. The firm said the funding will go toward acquisitions and tech innovation. Lawsuits have been filed against a laundry list of brokerages, including Wells Fargo, LPL and others. The firm is highlighting its potential advantages for advisors who might be on the fence about going to LPL Financial. Thematic and high-fee strategies were some of the more popular index funds among RIAs, according to a new report. They ‘undermine FINRA’s foundational mission of investor protection,’ says the Public Investors Advocate Bar Association. Some worry about adding to the already ballooning national debt, while others applaud extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The proposal is designed to give a larger swath of investors access to private offerings. Economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions have family offices becoming more selective with their allocations, per BlackRock. The Social Security trust funds will only be able to pay out 77% of benefits by 2034, a new report from the administration found.

Title: The ex-Amazon employee who's helped nearly 4,000 laid-off workers score jobs

A few years after Amir Satvat landed his first video-game job at the age of 38, layoffs started piling up across the industry at companies such as Xbox maker Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. Seeing many of his new peers let go, he became motivated to lend a hand. Satvat built a website and filled it with a range of free resources tailored for out-of-work game talent. It includes two still-growing lists — one of job postings and another with contact information for hundreds of people he enlisted to provide support, such as résumé reviews and mock interviews. "I was like, what if I made the most comprehensive job listing site ever?" Satvat told Business Insider of his thinking when he got started on the initiative in late 2022. "I'm good at modeling, scraping the internet." Satvat also created a Discord group for the site's users to network with each other and he's given away thousands of tickets to industry events that he acquired by partnering with their organizers. He said he doesn't charge or make any money off his career site, describing it as a purely philanthropic side hustle. Based on user feedback, Satvat said his efforts to date appear to have helped around 3,900 ousted game-industry workers find new jobs, a feat that earned him the inaugural Game Changer award at last year's annual Game Awards show in Los Angeles and this year's Giving Award from the nonprofit Games for Change in New York. Those honors come as the game industry has been grappling with an exceptionally high volume of layoffs. An estimated 37,600 jobs have been shed since 2022, according to an online tally of termination announcements and media reports compiled by Farhan Noor, a technical artist in California. Like employers in many other industries, game companies overhired during the pandemic but other factors have contributed to the cuts, too, such as rising production and marketing costs. Satvat has been a gamer since he was a kid, and by high school, he knew he wanted to work in the industry despite not having artistic inclinations. "I just liked business stuff," he said. But after earning undergraduate and graduate business degrees, he couldn't find any game jobs near where he lived on the East Coast, and staying close to family was a nonnegotiable. "I come from a very tight knit diaspora of a Persian community," he said. Satvat spent several years in business-development roles outside gaming, most recently in a remote one at Amazon's cloud-computing unit. In late 2020, after his first year at Amazon, a colleague introduced him to Ethan Evans, a leader in the company's gaming division. Satvat explained that he was a devoted player of franchises like "World of Warcraft" and "The Legend of Zelda," and the conversation ultimately landed him the kind of job he'd long desired. "It was transparent how much he knew the [game] community and loved it," said Evans, who also didn't start his career in gaming and is now an executive coach. Satvat "wasn't trying to get a promotion. He was trying to move from one thing to another to get closer to something he wanted to do." About a year later, though, Satvat reluctantly resigned from Amazon because the Seattle-based company began mandating in-office attendance, which meant he'd have to relocate. He said he was fortunate to quickly land his current job, a remote business-development position at Chinese game giant Tencent. The person who previously had it reached out over LinkedIn to say he'd just left the company and that Satvat should apply for the role. Satvat later learned that this person found him through mutual LinkedIn connections and was aware of his career site. Now 43, married, and the father of three boys, Satvat works out of his home in Connecticut and continues to spend about 15 to 20 hours every week updating his career site. He also gets help from about 20 volunteers who are aligned with the project's mission of "empowering gamers at every stage of their career." Satvat told BI that it was his successful mid-life pivot to gaming from enterprise software and earlier, healthcare, that made him confident he could become a de facto career guru. When asked for his best advice for job seekers, including those looking to change industries, he pointed to old-fashioned networking. "Spend all your time meeting people," Satvat said. "Every single job I've gotten has been through a relationship."Correction: July 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date Satvat met Evans. It was late 2020, not 2021. Jump to

Title: Private equity is coming to your 401(k). Are the rewards worth the risk?

In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That may be about to change. Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves. And the Trump Administration is expected to sign an executive order in coming days that would call for federal guidance on adding private investments to 401(k) plans, the Wall Street Journal reports. Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market. Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically high-wealth individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries. Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years. But there’s a reason why wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds. In recent decades, “they actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool. Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks. “Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida. Along with the upside comes a steep downside. Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns. “These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.” The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer, and to do public stock offerings later. Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in a S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said. Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher. “Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature, because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.” Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.” Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund. Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age. Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily. That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out. In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees. Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers. Last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts. “Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote. Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion. “Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO. Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said. The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan said, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments -- or an executive order from Trump. “This will happen over time,” he said, “not overnight.”

Title: “The Corporate Takeover of Housing”

Time Published: 2025-07-17T09:00:01Z

Yves here. It is very hard to know where to begin with this article, since it repeats many tropes about the US housing market that are simply false. The big problem in the US is housing affordability. There is no housing shortage: The total is just short of 148 million. About 35% is rental property, which has a typical vacancy rate of 7%, so one could argue for reducing the total stock by 3.6 million. FRED shows the active listings for owned residences at under 1.1 million; Zillow has the for-sale inventory as of end of June at 1.3 million. Generously (for the purpose of this analysis) using the Zillow figure and assuming all homes listed for sale are not occupied, we get 143.1 million, so say 143 million. The Census put the number of households (admittedly as of 2023) at 127.8 million. So there is no housing shortage on a macro level, as many claim. Now real estate is always and ever local, so there are shortages in certainly chronically underhoused metro areas like New York City, and no doubt in certain other spots. The not-sufficiently-discussed issues are the mismatch in housing stock composition versus needs (particularly the dearth of affordable housing) and the way policy schemes to increase housing affordability, just like the canard of health care “access”, have increased prices and enriched providers. Let’s go through some underlying issues: 1. The breakdown of the traditional model of housing as a forced savings vehicle for retirement. Matt Stoller wrote about this in a law review article: The Housing Crash and the End of AmericanCitizenship. Back in the days when blue collar workers could buy a house, pay for a car in cash, and have a stay-at-home wife, jobs were stable. My father, who changed employers a few times, got raised eyebrows for tenures of less than 10 years. And even if not, labor demand was generally strong enough that a worker had good odds of landing other work in the same community for the same or even better pay. So the 30 year mortgage was a good match for a typical career duration. A worker or professional would buy a home and pay off the mortgage and then live in it at lower cost when he retired. Much shorter employment tenures are the norm. The average US employee has been with their current company only 3.9 years. Changing employers might entail moving, when transaction costs compared to the equity in a house are high. Divorce and disability also lead to home sales rather than staying put until you pay off the mortgage. 2. The US response to lack of housing affordability: to make housing less affordable. Dean Baker wrote about this after the global financial crisis (with worked examples) and was ignored. First buyer subsidies, allowing for more leverage, using government guarantees to lower interest rates allow for greater borrowing when buying homes which over time has helped drive up prices. 3. Zoning and shelter porn have contributed to too much building of too many big houses and not enough “starter homes” of the sort constructed after World War II and more modestly-sized condos and townhouses. This table, although with dated data, presents per capita as opposed to per house data, and gives an even clearer picture of how extravagantly housed (on average) Americans are: Many communities also resist building denser, as in less expensive housing, aka apartments and townhouses. Another zoning contributor has been the end of single room occupancy hotels and boarding houses, where tenants would rent a room and share a bathroom. Some boarding houses offered meals for an additional charge. I had assumed that gentrification was the big driver for the loss of this sort of dwelling. However (and the passage of these laws and regulations may have been part of this gentrification process), in California, and I assume nearly all places, it is illegal to have a housing unit with no bathroom. The argument is that it was a health risk to have a shared bathroom. 4. As Elizabeth Warren outlined in The Two Income Trap, not mentioning how rising income inequality and the loss of inexpensive college education at often very good state schools (government subsidies fell markedly in the 1980s) has led to much greater competition to get into “good” colleges, led in turn to the phenomenon she flagged, of the big premium for housing in “good” and “pretty good” school districts. The article also incorrectly states that “home prices have surged nationwide.” Admittedly this Zillow chart goes back only to 2017. Although “surge” is arguably accurate, the text gives the impression that this is a long-term phenomenon when over the last decade, the frenzied buying during the Covid work from home phenomenon was the big perp. The Zillow chart does show a faster rate of increase, but the table below makes the pattern clearer: The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades. However, it is true that with stagnant real wages, the increase in housing prices can and likely does exceed the increase in average real wages. And that is a huge issue. But that was not the claim made. In addition, the headline claim is incorrect as far as single family homes are concerned. Yes, private equity firms bought foreclosed homes from Fannie and Freddie after the crisis (and not in bulk sales, there was so much interest that the GSE did only “mini-bulks”). We warned at the time that single family homes were not well suited to corporate ownership and property management. They are too diverse in type and construction and too spread out to be managed efficiently. There are no scale factors save at most in rent collection. Consider the corporate owner’s economics versus that of the classic small landlord. He might be an electrician, plumber or carpenter and have someone regular who could perform the tasks beyond his expertise. The houses he owned would be nearby. And he would know their quirks. By contrast, the driving distances alone and the difficulty of managing maintenance staff efficiently works against the owner of dispersed single family homes. Wikipedia notes: According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes, and up to 10 percent in certain metro areas such as Atlanta. Housing researcher Paul Fiorilla, quoted in the Washington Post, stated that it is unlikely that large institutional investors have a significant impact on prices, except for select areas where their concentrations are unusually high: “‘Any segment that owns such a small percentage of the market cannot have that much of an impact on prices,’ with the possible exception of a handful of communities with a significant concentration of big investors.” Some housing advocates have argued that public attention to large institutional investors distracts from structural causes of the housing affordability crisis, such as the housing shortage and its roots in exclusionary zoning and other laws that empower NIMBY obstruction of housing. Indeed. Now to the main event. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute The 2025 U.S. housing market presents a paradox. Home sales are down, and there are far more sellersthan buyers, yet prices continue to hit record highs. Over the past decade, home values have surged nationwide, including in once-affordable Sunbelt cities. Policymakers appear ill-equipped to respond to the situation. In a July 2025 interview with the New York Times, 16 U.S. mayors listed housing as one of their top concerns. During her 2024 presidential campaign, former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed tax credits for first-time buyers to alleviate the crisis, while President Donald Trump has renewed calls for interest rate cuts to help lower mortgage rates. Homeownership remains central to the American dream, and U.S. homeownership rates have typically hovered around 65 percent “from 1965 until 2025,” according to Trading Economics. But the high-water mark came in 2004 when it reached 69 percent, and despite a temporary COVID-19-era spike, the rate has continued to inch downward. Worryingly, even among those who own homes, equity is shrinking. Many homeowners own less than half of their property’s value today, with the balance tied up in debt. Many of the pressures are structural. Construction costs have soared, labor is in short supply, and tariffs have raised the price of materials. Zoning laws, tax regimes, and anti-density regulations have stifled urban growth, while sprawling development is hitting geographic and environmental limits. Mortgage rates remain high, and the national housing shortfall, now estimated to be more than 4.5 million, continues to worsen. But the crisis has opened the door for new kinds of investors. A growing cast of corporate actors is moving into residential real estate, lured by the prospect of stable returns in a tightening market. Though they still own a minority of U.S. housing, these firms are often concentrated in key regions and markets. Increasingly capable of setting the terms of access to housing, their rising influence threatens to reverse the post-World War II surge in widespread homeownership. Buildup Large-scale corporate ownership of homes and influence over rent prices is a relatively recent development. Before 2008, most institutional investors stuck to apartment buildings and urban areas, as single-family homes were seen as too dispersed and costly to manage. That changed after the housing crash, when a wave of foreclosures flooded the market, leading to the availability of deeply discounted homes in the suburbs. “In the decade since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, major institutional financial actors have invested heavily in U.S. single-family housing, acquiring anywhere up to three hundred thousand houses, and then letting them out,” stated a 2021 article in Sage Journals. In 2012, government-backed mortgage giant Fannie Mae began selling thousands of foreclosed homes in bulk to investors, showing single-family housing could be bought, held, and profited from at scale. At the same time, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded support for institutional buyers through favorable financing terms and lower rates. Homebuilding, meanwhile, had collapsed, and a supply shortage began to take hold. “The crash badly hurt a variety of sectors, but it simply devastated the home construction industry, given that the crisis was directly centered there. … with a glut of foreclosures on the market and prices falling fast, America simply stopped building homes. New private home starts plummeted by almost 80 percent to the lowest level since 1959,” according to a 2024 article in the American Prospect. Investor interest surged as home prices recovered in the early 2010s. This era brought record-low interest rates and trillions in financial stimulus from the Federal Reserve and government, which helped stabilize the economy and flooded capital markets. With cheap borrowing and rising prices, housing became an attractive asset. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Remote work drove people from cities to suburbs, while eviction moratoriums pushed many small landlords to sell, opening the door for larger buyers. Digital platforms made it easier to browse, purchase, and manage properties remotely. Alongside traditional banks, a wide range of financial firms and platforms have been profiting from rising demand and tightening supply. Wall Street Landlords Blackstone, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, became a pioneer in large-scale housing acquisitions after 2008. In 2012, it helped launch Invitation Homes, now the largest owner of single-family rentals in the U.S. Though Blackstone sold its stake in 2019, it reentered the market by acquiring Canadian real estate firm Tricon Residential in 2024, and sold 3,000 homes that year to UK’s largest pension fund for approximately $550 million, showcasing its global influence in housing. Other major firms have followed suit. Progress Residential, backed by Pretium Partners, has come under fire for evictions, maintenance failures, and excessive fees. Amherst Holdings was profiled in Fortune in 2019 for using early predictive algorithms to identify and acquire homes, and advances in AI have only made this process more efficient. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), originally designed in the 1960s to give everyday investors access to real estate profits, are now largely dominated by major institutional firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and private equity funds. Invitation Homes agreed to pay $48 million to the Federal Trade Commission in 2024 for junk fees, unfairly holding security deposits, failing to inspect homes, and using improper eviction tactics. Professor Desiree Fields, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 2021, meanwhile, singled out Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent as “particularly vocal about the use of extraneous fees to increase total revenue,” stated a 2022 article in the Charlotte Observer. Corporate homebuying continues to climb. Institutional investors bought 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of 2021, which climbed to nearly 27 percent by early 2025. In some markets, the footprint is even larger: during the third quarter of 2024, investors accounted for 44 percent of all home flips. Some firms, like Rise48 Equity, focus on acquiring and renovating large multifamily buildings to raise rental income and property value. Others, like Amherst Holdings, are beginning to enter the rent-flipping space as part of a larger expansion policy. Unlike smaller flippers who tend to cash out quickly, these companies renovate and hold properties long term. A growing number of companies are focusing on build-to-rent subdivisions, with entire neighborhoods constructed specifically for rentals. No single company dominates nationally, but corporate influence is unmistakable in certain cities. In Atlanta, private equity owns more than 30 percent of single-family rental properties, with corporate ownership disproportionately affecting Black neighborhoods, intensifying housing insecurity and displacement. Large firms enjoy several structural advantages. They access cheaper institutional financing, often pay in cash, and benefit from early access to listings and local policy influence. Firms can use creative financing tools, like combining many homes into a single investment package and using the expected rent payments as collateral to borrow more money. Bulk purchases allow them to cut costs on repairs, insurance, and maintenance, while builders are more inclined to sell homes in large blocks at a discount rather than wait for individual buyers, helping firms to avoid bidding wars. Unlike individual homeowners who often sell for financial reasons, institutional landlords can hold assets for years and sell only when market conditions are favorable. Tax policies further tilt the scales. While individual sellers pay capital gains taxes on home sales, corporate buyers can use the 1031 exchange to defer taxes by reinvesting profits into like-kind properties, pushing tax burdens into the future. Rental property owners also get tax depreciation benefits, which allow them to deduct part of the building’s value each year, reducing their taxes, which compound over time. Tech Big Tech, with similar vast financial resources, has also become essential to the expansion of corporate housing. It enables investors to scale up, manage properties remotely, and influence markets and consumers to their advantage. One of the most influential tools is YieldStar, a rent pricing software developed by RealPage, purchased by private equity firm Thoma Bravo in 2021. RealPage gathers extensive rental data from participating landlords and uses algorithms to recommend optimal prices. Landlords who don’t use the technology are often left at a disadvantage. Many property managers adopt these recommendationsautomatically, often under performance monitoring that discourages underpricing or offering tenant concessions. In cities like Seattle, where a handful of property managers control large shares of the market, RealPage’s pricing influence can be especially powerful. A ProPublica investigation found that in one neighborhood, 70 percent of apartments were handled by 10 firms, all using RealPage software. Recommendations by the software included accepting lower occupancy rates if it leads to higher overall rent revenue. Critics argue that RealPage enables coordinated “rent-setting,” effectively encouraging landlords to behave like a cartel. The U.S. Justice Department opened a lawsuit against the company in 2024 for causing harm to American renters by using its “algorithmic pricing software.” The investigation remains ongoing. At the same time, short-term rental platforms like Airbnb have also reshaped housing. With vast reach and deep legal resources, Airbnb has helped normalize rental conversions and contributed to higher rents in many cities. In 2025, the New York Post reported that the company funded $1 million to alleged grassroots groups, such as Communities for Homeowner Choice, to oppose a New York City law requiring hosts to be present during guest stays. It has also backed tax battles and filed lawsuits across the U.S., challenging occupancy taxes and other local regulations, costing cities millions in legal fees. In both long- and short-term markets, tech platforms have made large-scale rental operations possible. Through pricing tools, political lobbying, and data leverage, housing is emerging as a more managed commodity. As corporate consolidation deepens and larger landlords become more integrated with tech platforms, these companies, and increasingly the property owners themselves, will exert even greater control over rent markets with less transparency or oversight. Addressing the Issue Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including the U.S., now have some of the lowest home ownership rates in the world, and the rise of institutional landlords will drive those numbers lower. The core problem remains supply, with Wall Street firms targeting homes precisely because there’s a shortage—something they openly acknowledge and tout to investors as a profit opportunity. The city of Austin is a rare success story. After peaking at $550,000 in May 2022, median home prices fell to $409,000 by January 2025, and indicators point to a continual downward trend. The key difference has been that Austin has built more affordable housing, providing incentives to ease zoning laws. Homeownership remains most common in rural areas, while urban centers have been hardest hit by rising investor activity and housing scarcity. Public involvement is critical to reducing the problem. Landlord interests, represented by groups like the National Multifamily Housing Council, carry enormous influence, while tenants rely on thinner support networks like the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency play a role, but lag behind corporate influence. In comparison, Blackstone has faced greater resistance in European countries with stronger tenant protections and better-organized renters’ movements. Policies like taxing the unimproved value of land could encourage development and discourage speculation on vacant or underused properties. Without effective measures, the concentration of land in private hands will only grow, whether through corporate landlords, billionaires like Bill Gates (who owns 250,000 acres spread out over 17 states), or creeping attempts to privatize public land. At stake is not just affordability but also whether the public retains any real claim to land and housing or surrenders it entirely to private capital. Is the “housing theory of everything” legit, or some neolib scam? I haven’t looked into it much. I do remember somebody’s-law saying that increasing wages in any region just resulted in the money going to landlords. I’ve made some effort to re-find the article explaining it, without success. I believe this thesis is the essence of Henry George’s Progress and Poverty Mathematically, simplified you have a Markov chain where a house can be in one of two states- 1) owned by noninvestor (e.g. family) 2) owned by investor. the family may sell the house to anyone every few years. the institutional investor does not generally sell and when they do they exchange to another investor in a SFH portfolio. State 2 is an absorbing state-eventually investors will own most properties. Consider this Markov matrix which represents families retaining house/selling to other family 85% and selling home to investor 15% (e.g annually). the investor only sells to a family 2% of the time and keeps/exchanges house to investor 98% of the time. in time, most houses will belong to state 2. 0.85 0.02 0.15 0.98 Theoretically an equilibrium can be maintained if the level of transition is lower than that of the growing number of families buying new construction, but new construction of affordable properties is not high. So it doesn’t happen. That intro by Yves is so cathartic to read but unearths the embittered feelings from my failed ventures. Watching a neighborhood largely get torn down and replaced with mcmansions but not a peep from the city. Meanwhile trying to build a few townhouses kicks off a local war. I’ll admit to feelings of weariness and hatred for the new home buyers. Cities, or their elected officials, are not immune to the benefits of big new houses. They expect more donations and higher tax bases, so the corruption supply and demand stay roughly in balance. Alternatively, there is the new California approach, Pacific Palisades edition. Fire burns down a desirable neighborhood? Use red tape to delay permits and construction. Then use new State funds to buy up targeted lots to build the right kind of new housing. Due process becomes do process to some, doo-doo process to others. Will potential voter increase effect outweigh the impact of the decline in donations. California Assembly is pausing the Palisades land grab bill after citizen input. Everyone, keep contacting your politicians at all levels to let them know what you think about issues and legislation. That provides more hope and voices that can’t be so easily ignored. When home building does happen now, its increasingly swaths of straight to rent subdivisions as the article mentions. Rather than trivial “homestead exemptions”, we need local “non-occupancy taxes”. If the home is not lived in by the owner- a hefty tax ensues. We already have that in most jurisdictions, or as in the case of California, Prop 13 which has somewhat the same effect. (And doing a 1031 exchange won’t prevent a Prop 13 valuation reset AFAIK). Here in Honolulu we have an increased property tax rate on non-owner occupied real property over $1 million, which means pretty much all 4 BR single family detached. I’ve seen articles claiming Gen Z prefers to rent, but it isn’t clear if that’s due to affordability. From a new build perspective, the costs associated with getting government authority to develop seem designed to push for the highest possible price for finished product. We’re mom-and-pop landlords of single family housing. They’re debt-free and if there were mortgages there wouldn’t be much if any cash flow. And for depreciation expense, you’re limited in the amount of net loss you can take for income tax; any excess has to be carried forward until you dispose of the property. Interesting. Thanks! The Zillow price chart to 2017 shows a price increase from 225k to 375k over 8 years. That’s an effective compound average of about 7% a year, is that not higher than CPI? Further, we cannot assume that the median home sold today is the same as that sold 8 years ago. What I’m seeing locally is a lot of homes on the market with issues of mould, termites, structural damage, rodents, etc that sellers don’t want to pay for. I suggest you use the official CPI calculator from the BLS which allows you to select a start and end month. It confirms my statement. You take the start level and month and ask what the future value (as of June 2025 would be. It is higher than the average house price shown by ~5%. https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm Yves, can you share your inputs? I’ve run that same calculator for June 2017 to June 2025 and I clearly get a lower much rate than you’re getting… Oof, I need new glasses. I ran it TWICE last night and misread the end #. Will correct the post. I discounted the look of the chart due to scaling and figured the much discussed Covid surge had been offsite by price stagnation/falls in places people were exiting. A table in this post gives a much clearer picture of what happened. The “surge” is very much due to the Covid WFH buying spike, as in a two year buying frenzy that has stuck (as in most of those who bought at those prices are anchored and won’t sell for less if they do sell): https://bilello.blog/2025/the-ultimate-guide-to-home-price-appreciation Will add it into the main post. The other thing that happened during the covid period is that the price per sqft to build went from approx $200/sqft to $400/sqft. I’ve built and rebuilt (actual banging nails) several houses over the years. Pre covid a Doug Fir 2×4 was about $2. they went as high as $8. Asphalt roofing almost tripled per square (10×10) to install. Price per sqft is still in the upper $300’s… My pet peeve is realtors price older houses (in FL ) the same per sqft as new or late model (Miami/Dade specs).. AND PEOPLE PAY IT !!!! In that cast they’re buying a Yugo for the same price as a Mercedes….. Drives me nuts !!! Well, I count ~3.5% CAGR in inflation from June 30 2017 to June 30 2025, and I also get a little over 6.5% for 225K to 375K… Also, if you look at the Zillow chart closely, it clearly shows a much higher price growth level from mid-2020 to mid-2022, which is the surge people are talking about. It was a 50% surge as far as I can tell eyeballing the graph. And noting that this aggregate hides a distribution, there are surely markets where home prices increased 75-100%. Sure, if you take that surge over a long period and compare to CPI, may or maybe not better. It’s also very likely that references to a surge in “home prices” are imprecise references to home purchase affordability, where a high price has been compounded by higher mortgage rates and higher home insurance premiums even after the technical price surge stopped in mid-2022. If you start with a $225,000 home financed at 80% LTV at 5% in 2017 with $1500 home insurance and 1% property tax, the monthly PITI would be about $1278. If you increase the home value to $375,000, set the interest rate at 7%, and grow the home insurance to $2500, that’s monthly PITI of $2516–just almost double in 8 years. What is not considered here is the attitude of Generation Z members (born after 2000) who now at the age of 25 should be at the age of considering the purchase of first time homes. Unlike generations before them, home ownership is no longer as important as it was. It appears that this generation is keener on spending money on life experience more than previous generations. Hence the rise in tourism, travel and doing cool stuff amongst them. Could it not be that some big business has seen this gap and is catering for it? Complete speculation on my part, but I would argue it’s a chicken/egg issue – Housing is way more expensive, jobs are way shitter, much more precarious (what good is a 30 year mortgage if I’m not even sure I’ll live that long, let alone have a job that long, plus any necessary savings to weather several likely job changes and still cover mortgage), and pay way less. Yet I’m supposed to save up for a 20% down payment to incur a long term liability for an asset that I may not be able to hold on to? Eff that. I may as well spend what little money I have on something I will enjoy and will make existence slightly less shitty. It’s not that Gen Z or Millennials don’t want their own place – the drive to own a house in the US is strong and deep – no cultural history of multi generational family living together, unlike say Italy. Given the opportunity, who wouldn’t want their own place to make your own / live in / get laid in without having to deal with parents? It’s just that prices are obscene, and it’s not realistic, given the difficulty of obtaining stable, high paid work, to even consider purchasing. So you either rent and try to live your life, or live with Mom and Dad if that’s an option, and take it day to day. Ownership, one of the few ways to guard against getting screwed over, is still just as important…just not attainable. Maybe I’m reading it wrong. Apologies if so. I think this is a fairly accurate assessment. You can see this reflected in young people’s voting patterns being towards candidates that promise to improve affordability of homes. Trump was vocal about this with interest rate policy, and in the recent Canadian election many young people believed Pierre Poillevre would make homes more affordable. The drive to own a home is still there, but most younger people have jobs that aren’t paying enough to achieve that. There’s a huge divide in young people’s affordability depending on career paths out of highschool. Those who went into trades, specialized medical fields, or engineering fields are doing well. Those who went into other fields are struggling to find well paying jobs. I do think there’s an aspect of financial illiteracy as well, but I’ve seen the above in kids from wealthier parents who you would think would pass it on. I agree with you, but wanted to add a little bit of shading regarding one point. “Financial Literacy” in this context has multiple layers, none of which bode well for the younger set. 1. Financial literacy generally is not taught in schools, and especially not primary school. Math certainly is (quality notwithstanding), but its application to the real world is incredibly limited. That this is beneficial to multiple companies and entities that subsist on predatory behavior and ill-advised financial decisions may or may not have direct bearing but they certainly benefit. 2. Even if kids get some literacy, it takes time and experience to develop any kind of savvy, if they ever do. Couple this with the fact that financial products GENERALLY are far more complex than they were 70 years ago, and contain much more in the way of weasel behavior and awful traps (as neoliberal norms have allowed them to flourish – decent social behavior from a corporation is largely a financial liability), you basically have to get screwed a couple times to realize where the pitfalls are. Only as you age do you recognize these old wolves in new sheep skins. 3. Even being well-to-do is no guarantee. Providing a good financial education, as a parent, to a child, is incredibly difficult. It took me years to educate myself financially, and I’m still only halfway there, not to mention any terrible habits and stupid behavior that I’m still struggling with. I wouldn’t know where to start with a young child. Better than nothing, sure, but not ace, either. 4. Becoming financially literate, or at least practicing at financial literacy, requires…you know…finances. Excess finances. Buying in bulk, for example, or even being able to say no and walk away from something obviously bad necessitates having some amount of leverage. In many cases that leverage is money, or some equivalent. Many studies have shown that poor people, when given direct cash payments, are remarkably rational and spend money in the ways that are most beneficial in the longer term. When you have no excess cash, though, the most rational decision is usually the one that keeps your kids fed, or the lights on, or a roof over your head. After all that, if I only have $20 left, I may as well buy some smokes because it won’t do shit for future planning. Having no excess cash is basically like running your life using lean principles and JIT inventory. The mildest setback is usually a complete disaster. Congress can disallow corporate landlord income tax write-offs for interest and depreciation on SFH and multi-units less than 13.. Problem solved. Could you explain how that would work for REITs? I agree that this post which Yves vivisected falls far short of making its argument after she discredited some of its claims: “According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes…” That alone crumbles the key stone holding up the post’s headline and themes. However, I believe corporations and private equity do create a significant effect on the cost of housing through their investments in apartments and their activities colluding to drive up rents. My only warrant in making this claim is my own feelings of powerlessness as a renter. Moving is an ordeal. Landlords often have tenants at their mercy as they raise rents as I have experienced renting an apartment from a corporation and as a private equity firm bought a little duplex where I lived some years later. I have always wanted to own my own home but my work and life situation made home ownership too costly. I have often had to move across the country to follow jobs. The squeeze on rents, availability of rentals in many urban areas, and orders to move following the sale of the apartments where I lived only added to my desire to own my own home. In comparing rents to monthly mortgage payments, the increasing cost of rents, persistent rent increases, and threat of being moved out to accommodate gentrification added to my demand to own my own home and my willingness to increase how much I might pay for that home. I believe corporate land speculation added with the land speculation by the 10% who have captured the share of earnings growth that might have accrued to the lower 90% helped drive up land prices. The upper 10% have more directly added to the price of homes through their purchases of second homes in otherwise relatively affordable areas. In the small city where I have been looking for a home, I drive by many homes on large, often elegant properties that appear unoccupied most of the year. I believe corporate employment practices helped grow the income spread between the upper 10% and the lower 90%. The COVID work-from-home policies added to this pressure and housing outside urban centers. I doubt the apartments previously occupied by the 10% came down in rent enough to help many in the lower 90%. The cost of land leads to the tendency for developers to build relatively expensive McMansions on postage stamp lots. Builders must build more expensive homes, which usually means bigger, grander homes, on smaller lots to get the most return. Apartments with affordable rents, even when allowed, do not yield sufficient returns, especially as the cost of getting loans to finance the purchase of more expensive land, labor, and materials to build housing. “The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades.” I tend to view this as indication that housing prices have reached a point where home buyers are nearing the maximum amount of their income that they can afford to spend on housing. The changes in interest rates and the current tendency for loan agents to look askance at less than 20% down and buyers who would be paying more than a third of their income to pay for housing. I believe this post is too anxious to find a single cause for the high cost of housing in America. Nixon stopped the feds from building affordable housing, and Reagan cut HUD’s affordable housing budget by 75%. Homelessness surged to levels not seen since before the New Deal. Surprise! I fight a constant uphill battle in the public discourse (here in near proximity to Toronto) trying to get people to understand that the abdication by governments (at all levels) of the responsibility for building low income housing almost 40 years ago is directly related to the homelessness and housing affordability crises. “The market” never has, and never will, build sufficient low income housing — there’s no money in it! But neoliberalism has eaten almost everyone’s brains, so I am making little to no progress … 😒 Yep. And remember, Nixon’s act followed LBJ’s civil rights legislation that would have given people of color access to those affordable homes. Your email address will not be published.

Title: ‘Be single-minded’: Cork hurling heroes of 1966 on what it takes to end an All-Ireland drought

It may have been a Tipperary man who first popularised the use of “famine” to describe a dearth of hurling success, but few Cork people listening to Borris-Ileigh’s Richard Stakelum as he lifted the Munster Senior Hurling Cup in 1987 would ever thought it would one day apply to them. At that stage, Cork led the All-Ireland roll of honour with 26 titles, three ahead of Kilkenny and four ahead of Tipperary. The idea that the Rebels would experience a 16-year barren stretch was unfathomable to most on Leeside. The Rebels have remained consistent in Munster, but they have endured a long wait for an All-Ireland that stretches back to 2005. From the 1890s up to that point in 1987, Cork had won at least one All-Ireland every decade. With the peerless Christy Ring to the fore, they won five titles in the 1940s followed by three in the 1950s. The dry period between Cork’s All-Ireland wins in 1903 to 1919 stands out as a particular disappointment. However, that was ancient history by 1987. For Cork fans born in the 1920s, the halcyon days of the 1940s and the first half of the 1950s surely looked like they would never end. Until they did. “Those were the days,” as Mary Hopkin sang over a decade later. Cork’s failure to reach All-Ireland finals for a decade following the 1956 loss to Wexford meant fans were desperate for success when a young team finally made it back to Croke Park in 1966. That 1966 team offers the closest example in living memory of what the current Cork team are facing into this Sunday when they take on the Premier County in the All-Ireland final. The current crop of Rebel hurlers will be seeking to prove that famines – even 20-year famines, in their case – do eventually end. But unlike this year’s team, who go into Sunday’s final as most people’s favourites, the Cork team that entered Croke Park for the 1966 decider were rank outsiders and featured several under-21 players. Among them were the three McCarthys, who were all unrelated. Gerald and Charlie hurled with St Finbarr’s, while Justin hurled with Passage. This week, all three looked back on a day that earned them and their teammates a particular place in Cork hurling lore. Coming up against a seasoned Kilkenny outfit who had beaten Waterford just three years earlier to win the All-Ireland, that young Cork side ran out 3-09 to 1-10 winners. Colm Sheehan from Éire Óg netted two goals and John O’Halloran from Blackrock bagged a third . The three McCarthys also played their part. Justin, who was 21, lined out at midfield, contributing two-second half points. Gerald, also 21, captained the team from left half-forward and Charlie (20) lined out at right corner-forward. Each chipped in with a point. Justin recalls that while Cork had gone over a decade without an All-Ireland, it was no great burden to the team. “I think we were conscious that it had been 12 years,” he said. “We had all grown up seeing Cork winning in 1952, ‘53 and ‘54, and of course the loss to Wexford in ‘56. I suppose that gave us all an urgency to want to play for Cork and a lot of lads on the panel had experienced the lean years. [ Three Munster finals that created the mythos of Tipperary v CorkOpens in new window ] “We knew it was important to Cork, but a lot of us were very young. There was a blend of youth with Gerald and Charlie and Seanie Barry and myself, and there were older fellows on the team like Peter Doolan and Paddy Fitzgerald and Tom O’Donoghue and Denis Murphy. “None of us had ever played in an All-Ireland final before, but we were quite confident – we had beaten Clare after a replay and then Limerick and Waterford in the Munster championship, and we were well geared up and we were quite confident going in that we could beat them. “Gerald and myself were rooming together and I remember that morning, as we were going to Mass, he said to me, ‘we have a good chance’. I said, ’we have, and we’ll have that cup in this room this evening’. We had no fear.” Similarly, Gerald McCarthy acknowledged that they were all conscious of Cork’s 12-year barren run. He said: “There’s always an expectation in Cork – the fans nearly demand success. But in fairness, it wasn’t being overdone by people. We didn’t have fellows coming up to us on the street and saying ‘it’s 12 years’ or that sort of thing. We were a young team and people recognised that. [ Cork crowds, Tipp trips, Munster mastery: Seven-step guide to the 2025 hurling championshipOpens in new window ] “Okay, there was a bit of pressure, but I think when you are young, you can deal with it better. We had played Kilkenny in the league semi-final in Croke Park earlier that year, but we didn’t have a semi-final after winning Munster, so it was our first championship match in Croke Park. “So, we didn’t have any real experience of Croke Park, certainly not a crowd that size. We were a good mix of young and experience, but I think the younger players just took it on. When you are young, you don’t take in the whole impact of it and can deal with it better than an old stager. “I remember as we were going in from Lucan to Croke Park on the bus, The Beatles had a hit with Yellow Submarine and somebody started singing ‘We All Live in a Red Submarine’. It just clicked and everyone fell in with it and it just broke the tension, so we handled that well.” Charlie MacCarthy says it helped Cork that Kilkenny were such favourites to win. “We went into the game without any one really giving us a chance,” he said. “It’s a bit like Sunday with Tipp, nobody is giving them a chance. I was only a young fellow, just turned 20 and the attitude was, ‘we have nothing to lose, we’ll go up there and give it our best shot’. “And in fairness, everybody got stuck in and stuck in early. We really didn’t give Kilkenny a chance to settle down – our backs were very good, very tight and we got our goals at the right time and it settled us. We kept plugging away and things turned out right for us in the end.” Gerald acknowledges that Cork are going into Sunday’s game as favourites but says players can react in different ways to being favourites and the pressure it may bring. “The pressure can affect your head, but everyone is different and you have to learn to deal with it somehow.” Charlie thinks it will be a tight game, but feels that Cork might shade it, especially as they are driven by the pain of losing last year’s All-Ireland final to Clare. “I think it will be close enough,” he said. ”The Tipp lads are after improving since the League final and the round-robin game and they battled back well against Kilkenny in the semi-final, so it will be close. But I have a slight fancy for Cork and think they will shade it.” As for Justin, his advice to the current wearers of the jersey is forget about history and simply go out and hurl. He agrees that the desire to make amends for last year’s narrow loss to Clare could help drive them on “Yes, they have a chance now to redeem themselves for last year. That’s a good motivation but forget about 20 years – you can think about that afterwards when you win. It’s all on the day and you just have to be single-minded and go out with the belief you are good enough to win it.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi took us inside his $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, which closes today

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?” With tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.” The tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.) His advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.” And it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com 150 more countries will get tariffs of 10%-15% President Trump said letters would be sent to each government informing them of the “deals” they would receive.

The company did not immediately confirm the change. JPMorgan plans data fee that could hit crypto JPMorgan’s plans to charge fees for access to customer account data could make it economically impossible for many consumers to use stablecoins and crypto, according to three industry executives, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation. “This would cripple the crypto industry,” one of the execs said. How Carney approaches Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has a remarkable way of keeping President Donald Trump calm and collaborative—so much so that he’s been dubbed the “Trump whisperer.” Here’s how he does it. Markets fluctuate on Powell moves Meanwhile, President Trump maintained on Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell despite reports this week of a letter Trump had drafted to do so.

That Epstein thing won’t go away In a long post on Truth Social, the president insisted that anyone calling for the release of further information held by the government regarding Jeffrey Epstein was participating in a “hoax.” He said he wanted a decisive break with his own supporters who continue to push for more transparency around what the Department of Justice knows about the late billionaire financier and how he gathered his fortune: “I don’t want their support anymore!” Context: Epstein claimed he and Trump were friends for many years.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in early trading. Bitcoin is holding on at the $118K level. Macquarie on the “fiscal capture” of tariffs: “Traders are staying complacent in the face of the new ('August 1') US import tariffs; they may reason that Pres. Trump doesn't want to preside over another market crash. But there's also the more ominous possibility that Trump has "moved on" from using tariffs to extract concessions, and is now using tariffs to boost tariff revenues. If that's the case, August 1 may see a flood of new higher tariffs, as well as retaliation. This "fiscal capture" of tariff policy shouldn't seem peculiar. After all, there are a myriad of reports that Trump's desire to replace the Fed's Chair also comes from a need to "fiscally capture" monetary policy, thus reducing the federal government's interest burden should debt levels rise,” per Thierry Wizman. Wedbush on woes at ASML: “View: ASML's preliminary remarks highlighted the impact geopolitical tensions and threatened US tariffs are having on future business prospects. While ASML's bookings (~25% ahead of prior expectations) seemingly point to solid near-term conditions; management pointed to a lack of clarity around future results given the potential impact of policy decisions. ASML management noted for instance a 30% tariff on European goods could for instance lift the price of an EUV tool from €250 to €325). As such, management suggested they could not at this juncture confidently forecast revenue growth in 2026 (a result that in turn is weighing heavily on the stock this AM),” per Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault.

Title: Global agribusiness giants are seizing Ukraine’s fertile farmland
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-07-17-global-agribusiness-giants-are-seizing-ukraines-fertile-farmland.html
Time Published: 2025-07-17T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Key points: Ukraineâs "chernozem" soilâamong the most fertile in the worldâis being rapidly acquired by foreign corporations as Ukrainian farmers struggle amid war and displacement. IMF pressure forced Ukraine to lift a land-sale moratorium in 2020, opening the door for agribusiness giants to buy up vast tracts of farmland. Major investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, alongside agribusiness corporations, now control nearly 28% of Ukraineâs arable land. Ukrainian labor and regulatory loopholes allow these corporations to exploit cheap labor, banned fertilizers, and GMO cropsâpractices illegal in the EU. If Ukraine joins the EU, these corporations could flood Europe with cheap, deregulated crops, decimating local farmers while pocketing taxpayer-funded subsidies. The great land grab: How corporations are colonizing Ukraine Ukraineâs black earth, known as chernozem, is a national treasure, possessing nearly a quarter of the worldâs richest soil. Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests. The Oakland Instituteâs explosive 2023 report reveals a stark reality: foreign agribusinesses now dominate Ukrainian farmland, operating through shell companies in tax havens like Cyprus and Luxembourg. Entities like NCH Capitalâbacked by U.S. pension funds and university endowmentsâare buying up land at unprecedented rates. Worse still, Ukrainian oligarchs have sold off shares to Western banks, turning food security into just another Wall Street commodity. "They donât care about feeding peopleâthey care about controlling the food supply," warns AndrÃ¡s Tibor Cseh, a Hungarian agricultural expert. "Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice zone for global agribusiness." Deregulation warfare: How GMOs and banned chemicals flood Ukraine While EU farmers must comply with strict environmental laws, Ukraine has become a deregulated playground for agribusiness. Half the fertilizers used in Ukraine are already banned in Europe, yet corporations like Monsantoâblocked from operating in the EU due to GMO bansâsee Ukraine as an open frontier for genetic experimentation. With labor costs four times lower than Hungary and no animal welfare laws, Ukraine is a corporate dreamland. "There are no rules," says Cseh. "They grow whatever they want, poison the soil, and then sell the contaminated grain abroad." This toxic harvest isnât just a Ukrainian problemâthese cheap, deregulated crops will soon flood European markets, undercutting local farmers while filling corporate coffers. The EU membership trap: A corporate takeover in disguise The ultimate goal? Fast-tracking Ukraine into the EU, giving agribusiness giants duty-free access to 450 million consumers. Once inside the EU, these corporations will grab even more land while pocketing billions in farm subsidiesâpaid for by European taxpayers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmersâmany of whom opposed the land reformsâare being pushed aside. As land transactions surge post-invasion, foreign entities exploit legal loopholes, even bypassing Ukrainian citizenship rules through presidential decrees. "Theyâre not just buying landâtheyâre buying influence," warns the Oakland Institute.

If BlackRock, Monsanto, and Saudi investors can bleed Ukraine dry during wartime, theyâll do the same anywhere else. This isnât just about Ukraineâitâs about who controls the global food supply. Once these corporations monopolize farmland, they dictate prices, production, and even policy. Sources include: RMX.news Intellinews.com Europa.eu Key points: Ukraineâs "chernozem" soilâamong the most fertile in the worldâis being rapidly acquired by foreign corporations as Ukrainian farmers struggle amid war and displacement. IMF pressure forced Ukraine to lift a land-sale moratorium in 2020, opening the door for agribusiness giants to buy up vast tracts of farmland. Major investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, alongside agribusiness corporations, now control nearly 28% of Ukraineâs arable land. Ukrainian labor and regulatory loopholes allow these corporations to exploit cheap labor, banned fertilizers, and GMO cropsâpractices illegal in the EU. If Ukraine joins the EU, these corporations could flood Europe with cheap, deregulated crops, decimating local farmers while pocketing taxpayer-funded subsidies. The great land grab: How corporations are colonizing Ukraine Ukraineâs black earth, known as chernozem, is a national treasure, possessing nearly a quarter of the worldâs richest soil. Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests. The Oakland Instituteâs explosive 2023 report reveals a stark reality: foreign agribusinesses now dominate Ukrainian farmland, operating through shell companies in tax havens like Cyprus and Luxembourg. Entities like NCH Capitalâbacked by U.S. pension funds and university endowmentsâare buying up land at unprecedented rates. Worse still, Ukrainian oligarchs have sold off shares to Western banks, turning food security into just another Wall Street commodity. "They donât care about feeding peopleâthey care about controlling the food supply," warns AndrÃ¡s Tibor Cseh, a Hungarian agricultural expert. "Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice zone for global agribusiness." Deregulation warfare: How GMOs and banned chemicals flood Ukraine While EU farmers must comply with strict environmental laws, Ukraine has become a deregulated playground for agribusiness. Half the fertilizers used in Ukraine are already banned in Europe, yet corporations like Monsantoâblocked from operating in the EU due to GMO bansâsee Ukraine as an open frontier for genetic experimentation. With labor costs four times lower than Hungary and no animal welfare laws, Ukraine is a corporate dreamland. "There are no rules," says Cseh. "They grow whatever they want, poison the soil, and then sell the contaminated grain abroad." This toxic harvest isnât just a Ukrainian problemâthese cheap, deregulated crops will soon flood European markets, undercutting local farmers while filling corporate coffers. The EU membership trap: A corporate takeover in disguise The ultimate goal? Fast-tracking Ukraine into the EU, giving agribusiness giants duty-free access to 450 million consumers. Once inside the EU, these corporations will grab even more land while pocketing billions in farm subsidiesâpaid for by European taxpayers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmersâmany of whom opposed the land reformsâare being pushed aside. As land transactions surge post-invasion, foreign entities exploit legal loopholes, even bypassing Ukrainian citizenship rules through presidential decrees.

Title: More pain for would-be buyers as price of a typical home rises by €35,000 in a year

Report reveals the areas with highest and lowest price increases It's more bad news for those looking to get on the housing ladder. Stock image: Getty The cost of a typical property has shot up by €35,000 in the past year, putting a renewed squeeze on home buyers. Prices jumped again in May, the 21st month in a row of rising home values. In the last five years, buyers have had to pay an additional €74,000 to secure a home. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May. This is up from 7.6pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc, compared with May last year. The median, or typical, price of a dwelling bought in May was €370,000, up €5,000 on the median price in April. A typical property is now €74,000 more expensive than in May 2020, when the median price was €296,000, according to a deep dive into CSO data. The highest median price for a dwelling in May this year was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May this year, 3,824 home ­purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time-buyer purchases in May. The area outside of Dublin with the largest growth in house prices was the border region, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices rose an average of 10pc in the mid-west, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the south-east – comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford – had a 7.7pc rise in house prices. The Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late Independent economist Austin Hughes said the latest price surge suggested the need for somewhere to live remained a more important factor than nervousness about tariffs and trade wars. He said it was notable that the monthly increase in Dublin prices of 0.7pc exceeded that of the rest of the country. It was the first time since September that price rises in the capital were ahead of those outside of it. Property sales in the capital were 14pc higher in the first five months of this year compared to the same period last year, but sales in the rest of the country are slightly lower. “So, the Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late, possibly reflecting the impact of lower interest rates as well as relatively strong income growth,” he said. Mr Hughes said that, so far, there was little sign of any notable fallout from multinational tariff fears on the home sales market in the capital. This week, the Economic and ­Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there would be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said the Government was to miss its targets in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels meant the outlook for housing remained bleak.

Time Published: 2025-07-17T02:33:24Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of tech and social media giant Meta, have sued for more than $8 billion in in fines and legal reimbursements, in relation to an alleged privacy scandal at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, as per reports. The action is based on relevations that data of millions of Facebook users was accessed by now defunct political consultant Cambridge Analytica, and alleges that around 11 executives — including Mark Zuckerberg himself and former Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg — indulged in insider trading and used the company to conduct illegal data harvesting, while the board failed to oversee the social media giant's operations. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Spokespeople for Meta did not immediately respond to queries, Bloomberg and Reuters said. The report said that the Meta shareholders, comprised largely of union pension funds, alleged that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg “ran the company as an illegal data harvesting operation”, while the board “completely ignored their duty to oversee the company”. The claimants want reimbursement of over $8 billion in fines and legal costs from executives to Meta, which was paid to settle the 2012 privacy agreement violation to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trail in the Facebook ‘privacy scandal’ began at a Delaware court on July 16 (Wednesday), and is scheduled to last until July 25 (next Friday), according to a Reuters report. Notably, the case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J McCormick — the judge who rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package, as per a Bloomberg report. Among the defendants in the case are, venture capitalist and current board member Marc Andreessen; and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The suit alleges: Notably, after the insider-trading claims, Zuckerberg moved to seal his stock-trading strategies from public revelation during the trial, claiming that it is highly confidential information. Mark Zuckerberg controls about 61 per cent of the Meta board’s voting power through a dual-class share structure, effectively granting him sole control over the board composition and corporate strategy — past, present and future, the BB report noted.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect GE Aerospace Stock to Move After Earnings Thursday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-is-how-much-traders-expect-ge-aerospace-stock-to-move-after-earnings-thursday-11773161
Time Published: 2025-07-16T23:12:26Z
Full Content:
GE Aerospace (GE) is set to report second-quarter results before the opening bell on Thursday, with traders expecting a sizable move in the company's stock by the end of the week. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate GE Aerospace stock could move about 5% above or below Wednesday's close to around $266 by Friday. At the high end, that would put GE Aerospace shares above $280, after a strong year for the stock so far. The shares have surged about 60% in 2025 as GE Aerospace has passed the one-year mark since General Electric's transformation into three separate companies was completed last April. GE Vernova (GEV) is slated to post its own second-quarter results next week. GE Aerospace shares have been volatile after their recent reports. In the last two quarters, shares rose more than 6% on the day of each report, while they fell 9% and 5.6% on the day of the two prior reports. Last quarter, GE Aerospace topped estimates as the company said it was taking steps to mitigate the negative impact tariffs could have on its profits. GE Aerospace is expected to report a 13% increase in revenue from the same time a year ago to $10.27 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected have jumped nearly 20% to $1.43, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who cover GE Aerospace call the stock a "buy," though not all of them expect the stock to continue rising, with some price targets below Wednesday's close. Their average price target, however, assumes slight upside at about $270.

Title: Samsung Galaxy S25+ Review

Time Published: 2025-07-16T21:51:23Z
Full Content:
The Galaxy S25+ is the often overlooked Samsung smartphone model that I think hits at the sweet spot of the lineup. It’s a terrific device that’s only let down by middling battery life. And, yes, I know this review isn’t particularly timely. Samsung announced the initial Galaxy S25 family–which then consisted of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra–in January and then started shipping the phones to customers in early February. Then it added the thin new Galaxy S25 Edge in May and its related foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7, earlier this month. But these are collectively Samsung’s flagship phones for 2025, and they will remain current until new models appear next year.

"*" indicates required fields Δ My Samsung Galaxy S25+ looks stunning in the deep Navy blue color I selected at purchase. And that color extends from the back to the sides, which are often lighter if not a natural metal color, as on other phones, giving it a subtle visual differentiation that I really like. The body is made from a mix of aluminum and titanium, with elegantly rounded corners that are perfectly matched by the display corners. It’s a tad smaller than my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL at 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 inches, but it is thinner and, at 7.69 ounces, dramatically lighter than either. My iPhone is 0.33 inches thin and weighs 8.01 ounces, while the Pixel is 0.33 inches thin and weighs 7.8 ounces. It’s immediately noticeable. Flip it over, and you can see that Samsung arranges the three rear camera lenses in a vertical stack in the upper left corner on the back, with each encircled with a black metal ring. It’s a handsome and even minimalist look, with no additional visual interruptions save for the tiny circular flash cutout. My iPhone and Pixel have busier camera setups on their backs, but the Pixel does make up for it by using a camera bar that keeps the phone steady on a table in use. I use a case with all my phones, though, and the stock Samsung case (below) at least reduces the wobble. The minimalist design continues with the buttons: There are just three–Volume up, Volume down, and Power–and they’re arrayed on the right side of the phone. Beyond that, you’ll find the USB-C port on the center bottom, a nano-SIM card slot on the bottom, a speaker slit on the bottom, and microphone holes on the top and bottom. Samsung is widely credited with making the best displays in the industry, and the Galaxy S25+ is an excellent example: It features a 6.7-inch Dynamic LPTO AMOLED 2X display panel that that effortlessly matches the vibrancy and crispness of that on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The display has a tall 19.5:9 aspect ratio, a Quad HD+ resolution of 1440 x 3120–about 513 pixels per inch (PPI)–and an adaptive 120 Hz refresh rate. That’s a higher resolution and pixel density than I get from my iPhone or Pixel 9 Pro XL, but they’re comparable, at least to my eyes. The display is also incredibly bright at 2600 nits. This makes it suitable for use outdoors, even on the brightest of sunny days. The S25+ display is surrounded by small bezels, and it’s interrupted only by a small, centered camera cutout that I actually kind of like. It’s the right position for this type of thing, and it doesn’t get in the way that much when viewing media. The S25+ display panel is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, and you can increase its touch sensitivity in software if you use a screen protector (I did not). There’s also a separate accidental touch protection feature that I did enable. And IP68 dust and water protection, like other flagships. Speaking of which, Samsung provides Galaxy S25+ customers with a ridiculous number of display settings to consider, though most are familiar. You can configure Dark mode to come on at a set schedule, of course, and toggle options like Adaptive brightness, Eye comfort shield, Adaptive color tone, and Screen mode (which can be Vivid or Natural), but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You can separately configure the Screen zoom (scaling) and font size and style, change the screen resolution (which I left on the middle FHD+ 2340 x 1080 option, between HD+ 1560 x 720 and QHD+ 3120 x 1440), and even choose whether to replace the elegant round camera cutout with an artificial black bar at the top of the display. As with other modern smartphones, the S25+ also supports an always-on mode that’s reasonably customizable. It will display the date and time in large fonts at the top, of course, but you can toggle the wallpaper display and whether that wallpaper hides the background (for people or pets) and displays the Now bar (a sort of live update feature that can also appear on the Home screen) as needed, and even when it displays. I configured it to come on when tapped only, to help with battery life, but it can remain on, come on automatically, display on a schedule, or display when there are new notifications. Whew. As one should expect, the Galaxy S25+ delivers flagship-class components that elevate the performance and responsiveness of the device. It’s powered by a 3-nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that utilizes the same Oryon CPU cores as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips for PCs and provides powerful Adreno 830 graphics and Hexagon NPU capabilities. These parts deliver Apple-level enhancements over their predecessors, with a reported 45 percent gain in CPU performance with 44 percent better power efficiency, 30 percent better GPU performance with 40 percent better GPU efficiency, and 45 percent faster hardware-accelerated AI performance. And Samsung keeps things as cool as possible with a vapor chamber design that seems to work wonders. I often note my iPhone and Pixel getting hot, but that was rarely an issue with the S25+. The Galaxy S25+ also provides 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB or 512 GB of fast but non-expandable UFS 4.0 solid-state storage. (If you need more storage, the larger Galaxy S25 Ultra can be configured with up to 1 TB.) Performance is predictably top-notch, with none of the pauses and wait times that sometimes bog down my Pixel 9 Pro XL. There’s a certain silky quality to touch interactions with the display, and apps don’t so much load as they do snap into life instantly. I don’t typically play games on phones, of course, but I did check out Call of Duty: Mobile and Limbo for research purposes. For Call of Duty, I installed the higher resolution textures and played with an Xbox wireless controller hard-wired over USB, and the experience was incredible, with flawless performance and a surprisingly strong audio-video presentation. Limbo is a sideways scrolling puzzle game. It’s simpler, less busy title with touch controls and an atmospheric, wind-swept soundscape that also looked and played wonderfully. Granted, it doesn’t stress the system as much as Call of Duty, but it’s also the type of game one could pick up here and there as needed. The Galaxy S25+ delivers modern connectivity across the board, with global support for the latest 5G cellular data, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC. It supports dual-SIM configurations with one nano-SIM slot and embedded-SIM (eSIM) capabilities; you can use two eSIMs simultaneously and have multiple downloaded eSIMs on the device for later use. The USB port on the bottom of the phone is of the USB 3.2 Gen 1 variety, meaning it supports a pokey 5 Gbps data transfer speed, which is vaguely disappointing: At this point, flagship phones should support at least 10 Gbps. The S25+ provides stereo speakers, one on the bottom of the device and one less obviously in the earpiece hidden in the top of the display. This configuration is typical for smartphones, and it often leads to a sound imbalance that can be minimal or overt, depending on the device. And it is indeed obvious on the S25+, with the bigger and more exposed rear (right) speaker delivering more volume than the other. This is true in games, like Call of Duty: Mobile, and in media apps like YouTube and YouTube Music. But it’s also not entirely problematic since most will use earbuds or headphones for extended periods. The phone ships with Dolby Atmos for immersive sound with automatic optimizations, a nice software equalizer, dialog boost and loudness normalization options, and an Adapt Sound feature that lets you use age-based presets or create a personalized sound profile, albeit only for headphone/earbud use. It also upscales music and the sound in videos automatically when using headphones/earbuds. But the biggest advance here is a unique feature called Separate App Sound that solves one of my biggest issues with Bluetooth. Typically, you connect a phone to a Bluetooth speaker, start playing music or whatever, and every once in a while, a notification or other non-media sound will temporarily tune down what you’re listening to and interrupt it with its unpleasant and unwanted sound. I’ve long wanted something I think of as per-app Bluetooth, and that’s pretty much what Separate App Sound is: It lets you pair an app (like YouTube Music) with an audio device (your Bluetooth speaker) so that the audio playback from that app is never interrupted. Instead, notifications and other sounds will go through the default audio playback device (the phone’s built-in speakers). Nice! The camera system in the Galaxy S25+ is identical to that provided with the smaller S25 and a step down from that in the bigger and more expensive S25 Ultra. This was by design on my part: I have typically purchased phones with the best-possible camera system, and I’ve wanted to test a theory that this was perhaps unnecessary. I almost bought an iPhone 16 Plus in late 2024 before retreating back to the more capable iPhone 16 Pro Max. But for this go-round, I finally went for it. And I do not regret doing so. The hardware is solid, though only the main (wide) lens provides a high-resolution sensor. You get a 50 MP main lens with a 24 mm focal range, an f/1.8 aperture, dual-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF), and optical image stabilization (OIS); a 12 MP ultra-wide lens with a 13 mm focal range and a 120-degree field of view; and a 10 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, 30x digital zoom, PDAF, and OIS. There’s also a 12 MP selfie camera on the front, with a (wide) 26 mm focal range, an f/2.2 aperture, and dual-pixel PDAF. Those are just numbers. If you’re looking for something more impressive in the Samsung space, the Galaxy S25 Ultra takes it to 11 with a 200 MP main lens, a 50 MP ultra-wide lens, and two (!) telephoto lenses, one 10 MP/3x optical zoom and the other 50 MP/5x optical zoom. And while it’s a little unfair to compare the S25+ to higher-end phones, my iPhone 16 Pro Max has two high-resolution sensors, in the main/wide and ultra-wide lenses, while all three of the lenses on my Pixel 9 Pro have high-resolution sensors. I’m not sure that it matters most of the time, and I was never let down by the Galaxy S25+ over almost two months of steady use. More importantly, I never wished for more impressive camera hardware: Samsung was rightfully criticized for its overly processed images in the past, with overly vibrant colors, but it now provides what I think to be an ideal and subtle color boost that puts photos over the top. Across the board, in all lighting conditions, I was consistently happy with the quality of the photos I got out of the Samsung, and with little to no effort on my part. Details are crisp, the ultra-wide lens doesn’t distort the edges of images as much as the iPhone does, and even night mode shots are clear, without any obvious noise. Here’s the same shot with the wide (top) and ultra-wide (bottom) lenses: Portrait mode is also terrific, so much so that I’ve started using this style more because the S25+ is so good at it. Consider this shot of my sister, which is to me a non-standard Portrait mode setting, but a nice effect regardless. OK, it’s possible I got a bit carried away with Portrait mode, but I kept returning to it again and again. Telephoto is limited to 3x optical, but I never found that to be a problem. I only rarely need higher magnification, and Samsung’s digital/hybrid zoom is good to about 20x, which is impressive. At 30x, noise and hand unsteadiness become an issue, but of course they do. Here’s a quick look at what the various zoom presets look like: Samsung’s Camera app is excellent, with a simple and logical layout that was clearly one inspiration (the other being the Pixel Camera app) for the simpler new Camera app design coming to the iPhone with iOS 26 later this year. It has the expected mode slider on the bottom, obvious mode-specific options in an expandable menu, and quick access to those options one might toggle on/off on the fly at the top of the display. I feel like I’m always fighting the iPhone Camera app, but this is almost intuitive. Indeed, this phone might be currently my favorite for taking photos. The automatic nature of it all is impressive, and unlike the iPhone, I rarely if ever needed to retake shots to get the look I wanted. I don’t take much video, and nothing of note with the S25+, sorry, but it supports 4K60 and 8K30 for those that need more than Full HD. Ditto for selfies, though I did at least get a few, and they are all high quality, with good details. Samsung lets you toggle between two depths/zoom levels on that camera. Samsung provides a familiar dual-biometric authentication system, with an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint reader and Face Lock facial recognition. Also familiar, only the former is secure enough for banking transactions via whatever wallet app, and so I found myself resorting to the fingerprint reader a lot. It’s fast and reliable, at least, but this is an area where Samsung and Android in general still lags Apple and its nearly flawless Face ID. The trade-off for the thin and light Galaxy S25+ form factor is battery life: I was hoping and expecting that this phone would at least outperform the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is unexceptional in this category. But that was not the case. Real-world smartphone battery life is a bit difficult to measure accurately, but the Galaxy S25+ disappointingly delivers even less battery life than the Pixel. When I’m just working from home, which is typical, it can last the day. But when I go out into the world and actually use the phone–perhaps with Google Maps, Uber, Instagram, or whatever–it needs a mid-day top-off. If you have a fast enough charger–the S25+ supports up to 45 watts over a wired connection, though it doesn’t include a charger of any kind–you can fast-charge the phone’s 4900 mAh battery to 65 percent in 30 minutes, so that helps. It also supports 15-watt charging over Qi2 if you have a compatible case: I bought a third-party case to test that, and it appears to work fine. There’s even 4.5-watt reverse charging, though it’s more likely that the S25+ will need the juice than whatever other compatible device you might have. Still, it’s a nice feature, and it can be used while you’re charging the phone over USB. Samsung rightfully wants to control its own destiny, so it has built its own software and services, and its own user interface, on top of Android to create an entirely unique experience. This is understandable, but I’ve also criticized the company for overdoing it because Samsung smartphones are overloaded with superfluous and redundant apps and services, promotional upsells, and overlapping licensing agreements that are fraught with privacy implications. In this new AI era, this situation is, if anything, worse, with Samsung shifting from its ridiculous Bixby assistant to a combination of in-house Galaxy AI solutions and the Gemini-powered advances that Google delivers. It’s a lot to take in. So this time, I went in a different direction. I simply gave in. Navigating between the dozens of apps that Samsung supplies and the myriad of options scattered throughout Settings and elsewhere, I said yes to it, checked every box, signed in to my Samsung account at every prompt, enabled every feature. And while I am uncomfortable recommending that to anyone, I will tell you that it was OK. Aside from a few strident requests to purchase an extended warranty through whatever Samsung app, my blind acquiescence didn’t bother me too much. Instead, I adopted a sort of “don’t see, don’t worry about it” policy, similar to what I do with Windows 11 most of the time. Those apps can’t hurt me if I don’t see them. Samsung’s influence can be seen all over this device, and most of it is positive or at least non-problematic. It starts with the One UI 7 user interface, which is terrific and getting even better in the One UI 8 update that I’m now testing, and extends to Samsung’s first-party apps and services, including the DeX desktop mode that will come soon to Android more broadly, and the newer Galaxy AI features that permeate throughout the device, across the system and the apps. One UI is so good I wrote an article dedicated to this topic, and as features like Live notifications expand and improve, it’s getting even better. There’s a debate to be had about whether One UI or Pixel Android is “better,” but they’re both terrific in their own ways. I like all the helpful features that Google adds throughout Pixel and feel that it is superior from an overall functional perspective. But I like the look and feel of One UI much more. And it does have some terrific and unique features of its own, of course. The Samsung implementation of Live notifications is quite close to the Dynamic Island feature on iPhone, and I love it. The software bloat problem is real, of course. I used a handful of Samsung apps, mostly obvious choices like Phone, Camera/Gallery, and utilities like Calculator, Contacts, Clock, and so on. But I never found myself using any Samsung apps per se, and apps like Bixby (still hanging in there for some reason), Calendar, Gaming Hub and the dozens of others are mostly non-threatening or at least decent. There are some oddballs in there, like Global Goals, Samsung Members, Samsung News, Samsung Notes, Samsung Pass–seriously, it goes on and on–but … whatever. I don’t like having two stores, two wallets, two whatevers. But it’s … OK. Galaxy AI is likewise a mixed bag. Generally speaking, the Google AI features are better, which is especially obvious in photo editing. And because Samsung bundles Google Messages, I could take advantage of its writing assistance. But Samsung is going deep here: The S25+ features Call assist for real-time translation during voice calls, Writing assist across multiple apps, Interpreter for live translation with voice or text output across apps, Note assist in Samsung Notes, Transcript assist for voice and call recordings, Browsing assist in Internet (the Samsung web browser) for summaries, translations, and so on, Photo assist, Drawing assist for transforming sketches into generative AI artwork, Audio eraser for eliminating background voices, wind, and other noises from audio and video, AI-created Photo ambient wallpaper, a Now brief on the Lock screen and Home screen, Health assist in the Samsung Health app I didn’t really try, and probably more I’m missing. It’s a lot, and describing it all could fill a book. But I will point out that you can choose to process all AI tasks on-device for privacy, with poorer results. (I left the spigots open for the best results.) And some of this stuff is truly useful. You can use natural language to find settings in the Settings app, a feature Microsoft will fully add to Windows 11 later this year. The image editing tools are extensive, maybe too extensive, with generative edit and sketch functions, and there’s a fun Photo Studio feature in the Galleries app that can turn a photo into a comic, 3D cartoon, sketch, or other style (below). It works pretty well, but it has trouble with multiple people and will only transform one. Looked at another way, Samsung is at least adding AI where it makes sense. That Photo studio feature is a reasonable example. It could have been implemented as a standalone app, but it’s better and more discoverable as a feature of an app that people will use to manage and edit photos. This will ease customers into the AI functionality naturally. Or you can ignore it as you may with so many other app features. Samsung provides seven years of Android OS and security updates, matching the best available support lifecycle in the Android phone market. That’s stellar. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999 for a model with 256 GB of storage, and you can upgrade to 512 GB for a total of $1199. But no one should or would ever pay that price, as Samsung phones are almost always on sale, and typically with friendly trade-in values, especially for previous-generation Samsung devices. As I write this, the S25+ is $150 off, for example, and Samsung is offering up to $480 in trade-in credit. (Or more, as my wife’s Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra would actually fetch $500 on trade.) You can get a Galaxy S25+ in Navy, Mint, Icy Blue, or Silver Shadow regardless of where you purchase the device. But if you order directly from Samsung–which you probably should, for its sales and elevated trade-ins–then you can also choose between three additional colors: Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold. The unit I purchased is Navy, and it’s a pretty deep navy blue color that I truly enjoy. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ is a superior choice for those who prefer Android. It’s also my favorite smartphone overall, currently, though the broader Apple ecosystem is stronger and more cohesive than that offered by Samsung. It offers incredible performance, a terrific display, an incredibly strong camera system that’s also easy to use, future-proof components of every kind, and a support lifecycle that will quit on this device long after you do. Yes, Samsung bloats its devices with unnecessary apps and services, and the battery life could be a bit better. But One UI 7/8 is my favorite smartphone interface, and Galaxy AI combined with Google Gemini is coming along nicely on the AI front. When you factor in the regular sales and better-than-necessary trade-in values that Samsung offers, it’s almost a no-brainer. This phone surprised me and in all the right ways. The Galaxy S25+ is highly recommended. Pros Cons Paul Thurrott is an award-winning technology journalist and blogger with 30 years of industry experience and the author of 30 books.

Title: The Reason Tesla Is Failing Is That Elon Musk Is an Extremely Unlikeable Person

Time Published: 2025-07-16T21:24:56Z
Full Content:
Tesla has been losing money hand over fist — and the culprit is clear: Elon Musk, the company's CEO, needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror. In the wake of his latest Robotaxi gambits, which involve a dick-shaped service area map and a fare price rise from $4.20 to $6.90, it becomes clearer every day that the 54-year-old billionaire is a deeply unserious individual whose attempts at humor only drive home how annoying he is. Obviously, this is neither the first nor the last time Musk's massive dearth of likability has been pointed out. Considering all the other self-inflicted wounds he's sustained lately, it's impossible to ignore how inextricably his irritating public persona is linked to Tesla's nosediving sales — which have gotten so bad that a wave of its executives have either jumped ship or been fired. Though he was no saint prior to reigniting his on-off bromance with Donald Trump last year on the presidential campaign trail, the multi-hyphenate business owner's toxic politicking since then has hemorrhaged a staggering amount of goodwill he gleaned back when he was an environmentalist who wanted to save humanity by taking us to Mars. (In 2016, public polling showed that Musk's net popularity stood at a balmy +29 percent; now the figure stands at negative 23.) Nowhere is that Trump slump more evident than in Tesla's stock value, which is down a full 20 percent from the beginning of 2025. As the electric vehicle company's value has plummeted, its CEO was busy showing his derriere in as many ways as possible: by doing two Sieg Heil salutes on stage at the inauguration, establishing his stupidly-named Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) wrecker agency, and generally being a bigoted jerk on X, the social network he has transformed into a far-right haven under his ownership. And of course, the addendum to all that political self-sabotage might be the most incredible detail yet: Musk inevitably flamed out with Trump in spectacular style, meaning he now holds none of the influence that could help his business interests — and has managed to alienate huge swathes of potential buyers on both the right and the left. Aside from all that, Musk also seems to have been asleep behind the wheel of Tesla. The EV company has suffered tremendously under the billionaire's leadership over the past 18 months as he oversaw the disastrous launch of the ugly and crappily-made Cybertruck, became the repeated subject of government investigation over its incorrectly-named "Full Self-Driving" feature, and unleashed its uber-glitchy Robotaxi service onto the unsuspecting streets of Austin. When a regular person makes jokes about dicks and weed, it's generally cringe in an innocuous way. When the world's richest man does it — especially while hamstringing the federal government, being virulently bigoted, providing a safe space for literal Nazis, and operating "assisted driving" features that keep maiming and killing people — it's not at all cute. And the markets, obviously, have responded in kind.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Netflix Stock to Move After Earnings Thursday

Time Published: 2025-07-16T21:23:24Z
Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report earnings after the bell Thursday, with traders expecting shares could swing after the results. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate Netflix stock could move about 6% or $70 in either direction Friday. A move of that scale would lift shares to just above $1320 at the high end, or leave them near $1,180 at the bottom end of that range, their lowest level since May. Netflix shares lost about 1% Wednesday to close at $1,250.31. Still, the stock is up 40% in 2025 so far. Netflix's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 6% over the past four quarters, and risen in three of those instances. In April, shares rose a little over 1% after the streaming giant beat analysts’ expectations, thanks in part to higher subscription and ad revenues. Those results came shortly after Netflix executives reportedly said their goal is to double the company’s $39 billion in revenue last year by 2030. Analysts are largely bullish on Netflix’s long-term outlook heading into the earnings report, and expect the streamer to report rising revenue and profits. Of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 rate Netflix stock a “buy,” while just four give it a “hold.” Their average price target of about $1,330 is roughly 6% above the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.

Title: Corporate turnaround artist Jim Lanzone is “sticking to what users need” as CEO of Yahoo

On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, cohosts Diane Brady, executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media, and editorial director Kristin Stoller talk to Jim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo. They talk about the company’s nostalgia aspect, where it fits in a new era of search and AI, and keeping Yahoo a “guide to the World Wide Web.” Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Jim Lanzone: But if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet, I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Diane Brady: Good luck with that. Brady: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Leadership Next. The podcast about the people… Kristin Stoller: …and trends… Brady: …that are shaping the future of business. I’m Diane Brady. Stoller: And I’m Kristin Stoller. Brady: Yahoo, that’s what we’re talking about. I say “Ya-hoo” because I’m Canadian. Stoller: It’s your accent, and I love how you say it. But I, as a ’90s kid, say Yahoo. Brady: Yeah, and I say pasta. So it’s Yahoo and it’s Jim Lanzone, and he is the new CEO of a brand that is kind of hard to figure out. Tech, search, it’s media. It has been a cautionary tale. Is it a turnaround tale? What do you think? Stoller: I just want to bring us back for a second, to the golden age of Yahoo. Founded in 1994, think back, Diane—what were you doing then? And did you have a Yahoo email address? Or what was your email provider? Brady: I had just graduated. I was living in Asia. I remember my first email had many numbers in it, so I don’t think it was Yahoo. And look, I remember my first real encounter was when I came to the States, and I remember the arguments over whether we had to put the exclamation point, because they had an exclamation point in their name. And it used to honestly annoy me. It felt a bit sort of hubristic but yet it was the big beast in town. Stoller: See for me, all the cool kids at school had Yahoo and AOL. I was stuck with CompuServe because I think my dad got it for free. Yeah, I hated it. But okay, so now we’ve moved past—and although I don’t want to say move past, because they still have people with Yahoo email addresses, it’s still the number-two email I would assume, after Google or Gmail. Brady: A long number two. It has 3 billion hits a month, which makes you wonder about that intersection of influence—do eyeballs and influence still mean the same thing? And look, he’s an interesting guy. He’s an entrepreneur. He was at Tinder. He’s basically been a turnaround artist. He’s been there four years. And so what do you think? How much is Yahoo on your radar screen these days? Stoller: It’s really not. But I will say that I have two friends who work at Yahoo Finance and Yahoo News, and they love it and tell me they do really good work over there. Other than the journalism part of it, and I use Yahoo Finance to check stocks. I use it for stuff like that. I don’t use it for search. I don’t use it for anything else. And it was kind of a brand that I had thought, you know, had its heyday back in the early 2000s and they had so many missed opportunities. They lost the chance to buy Facebook, they missed out on a bunch of other deals. And I just thought they were kind of stagnant. Brady: But it lives to see a new day and like you, I’m very fond of the media properties, top notch journalists that they hire, I have to say. And look, I look forward to hearing what his vision is. You know, again, it’s, it’s past its 30th anniversary. As you pointed out, it’s still here, much like Ask Jeeves, which he also worked at. Stoller: Yes, he was the CEO of that pre-Google, pre-ChatGPT. Brady: So how do you turn around a legacy brand that has become a case study in failure. What does success look like? And it still has incredible traffic. So the bones, as he would say, are probably pretty good. Yeah, lots to talk about. Stoller: We’ll be back with Jim after the break. Brady: We’re entering an era of innovation unlike any we’ve witnessed before. You all see it: The pace of technological change is staggering, and it’s challenging for any leader to keep up. We spoke with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, which is the longtime sponsor of this podcast. Here’s his advice for leaders on how to navigate this new world. Jason Girzadas: There’s probably nothing more important for CEOs, no matter what organization they’re leading, to really be thinking about technology’s impact on our workforce. It’s really a function of, how do you think about technology in concert with your workforce? We at Deloitte talk about it as the age of width, the age of technology with your workforce, and really embracing this idea of the codependency of technology and workforce. We’re also an environment of a very tight workforce where there’s a scarcity of top talent. That’s going to be the challenge for organizations, to demonstrate to top talent that they can grow and evolve the work that they do, working with leading technology in a very aligned way. Finally, it’s what top talent really wants in an organization, is to learn and grow and to be part of an organization that’s supportive of them actually embedding technology in their work. Brady: Jim, I think the first thing that would be good is define Yahoo as it is now, because obviously, it’s, you know, media, it’s been search, it’s email, it’s so many different—it’s a tech company. I mean, how do you define it in your mind? Lanzone: It’s funny, and I’ve said this a couple times, but historically speaking, they would ask that question of the Yahoo CEO onstage at conferences. Brady: Oh, well, here we are asking. Lanzone: It’s a bit of a gotcha. So it’s a great first question. But because, you know, again, I think all the different ups and downs in the company and along the way as a public company, which there’s a lot of different pressure that came along with that, had to try to figure out what its way was going to be as the internet was evolving. And I can go into it, but our team picked it up after that, so we didn’t have all those pressures. You can step back and look at it when we picked it up, and understand, first of all, it’s a conglomerate of a lot of different products. Some of those products have media or or use media as a feature. Some are utilities, right, like search or email. Even within some products. So let’s take sports where we definitely have media. We have the number one NBA podcast, we have the number one combat sports podcast, we have the number one newsletter. But the spine of the book for sports is fantasy sports. You know, where we’re the OGs, you know, sports scores and things like that. And those are more products. So I think at the end of the day, Yahoo is a product company, and I can go all into product… Brady: …a product conglomerate. A conglomerate of different products. Lanzone: But that is common these days. If you think about Meta, right? You have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have WhatsApp, you have Oculus. Now, you have AI. Even Google, with anything from Android to Waze to Android to YouTube. Amazon, obviously, same thing. All of the major internet companies, and Yahoo, after all this time, is still a top five internet company in the US and globally. We get there as a combination of brands, but Yahoo—and my team, we had to figure this out when we got here, you know, after all this time. We just had our 30th anniversary this year, you know. Brady: And you’re approaching your fourth. Lanzone: Yeah, I started [at the] end of September of 2021, right after Apollo bought the company. But you know, what’s our reason for being? Like, why does Yahoo exist, and why has it been so successful through all the ups and downs? Why is it still so large and used? And you know, the answer to that was one answer, which is in all the categories where we were still at the top. So we’re number one in finance, number two in news, really number two in sports. Brady: Doesn’t sound like much of a gotcha question, then. Lanzone: Well, all of these categories where we were still at the top is—we were still fulfilling the founder’s original mission of the company, like back in 1995, which was to be the trusted guide, you know, through the Wild West of the internet. It’s just that that job changed between 1995 when you were just trying to find websites to get things done, all the way through to now, where you’re deploying things like AI to help people get things done, right? So how you do it changes, but what we do, being the trusted guide to the internet, doesn’t change. Stoller: So I’m a kid of the ’90s, born almost around the time Yahoo was founded. So I remember it very vividly. I remember—also, I think it’s funny that this is very full circle for you, coming initially from Ask Jeeves, you were the CEO of that, and now coming back to an internet company, which is very full circle. So you’re right. I think Yahoo has gone through a bunch of ups, a bunch of downs, totally different than what it was in 1994. But I think that, you know, in the mid-2000s people were really worried about this company. And so when people came to you and said, “Hey, Jim, do you want to take this job?” What made you say, Yes, I will. I will do it in this uncertainty.” Brady: Jim, I like a challenge lens. Lanzone: Yeah. Well, I always wanted a crack at this. I knew every previous regime of this company, a lot of friends and colleagues who went through here…. Brady: …should we rate them all? Lanzone: No, I mean all the different teams, like, you know, Jimmy Pitaro and Jeff Weiner and Brad Garlinghouse. You know, just the really original teams. You know, even the first team, because I really had two things… Brady: …Jerry Yang? Lanzone: Jerry Yang, who’s still involved with the company. I just had him back for an all-hands meeting. He was amazing, yeah, for the 30th. He’s an investor in the new version of the company after we spun out of Verizon. It’s really a new corporation. So it, yeah, and he invested in it. So it’s amazing. But no, I had done two startups in the ’90s, or was involved with two early-stage companies in the ’90s. So that led me to Ask Jeeves, that was my first turnaround, and I learned the hard way, like, why were we able to do that? And we, you know, I think we almost 50x the stock from where we picked it up at the crash, in 2001 to the peak of where we got to before we sold to IAC. And we had a lot of traffic, but we had a product that had seen better days, and a brand that had been through the ringer, and a team that had been also through it because it was the first crash. So you had to rebuild all that. And once you got the basics right and you got the team rebuilt, and you were actually executing on your basic value proposition, you know, then you could innovate. And we innovated our tails off in that time period, 2003 to 2007. We were, you know, we were the ones who innovated, who really created the [inaudible] approach to search. That was what we were known for. We were the first major partner of Google when they started to syndicate AdWords, and that really made us profitable. Stoller: …and I used Jeeves like the OG ChatGPT, I would ask it so many questions. Brady: I want to bring us up to 2025, I mean, like, but let me ask, because I do—think you mentioned turnarounds, and Ask Jeeves is just one of the many you’ve done. And what was it, to Kristin’s point, that you saw as the opportunity with Yahoo? Because we’ve just heard a litany, and it’s all very correct as to where you’re number one. Obviously, it’s also been a case study in what not to do. What did you see as the runway that you could create? Lanzone: Well, remember that the—let’s say, the case study in what not to do, it was very interesting… Brady: …don’t turn down Google. Lanzone: Well, if you go do the forensics, which I did, if you are in the late 1990s early 2000s, search doesn’t have a business model yet, and you are the trusted guide to the internet, and there’s been a market crash and everything, outsourcing search to Google, and before that, they did [inaudible] me for the best price possible, which included a link to Google with their logo on the page that when you got there was only a search box, which is how 91% of internet sessions started at the time. That was like a good deal, just so happens that, you know, it really ceded search to Google, and I think the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out what it should be, and it went into media, and it tried to look at social, and it took another crack at search, and I mean, all kinds of things as a public company. It then eventually sold to Verizon in the mid-2010s. And so when we got it, it was after all that. So we had the luxury of not being public, but those basic ingredients were there, which was a huge audience, huge and very important categories. And so both Apollo, who bought the company, and then brought me in as CEO, and me, we, you know, I talked to them before they bought the company. Our thesis was, if you could get that asset at the right price, and it was around $5 billion and if you look around everybody in the top 10 Comscore internet companies, they’re all trillion-dollar companies. You could work with that. And so I, you know, again, I could go through it, but we set about the turnaround process using those raw ingredients, and that’s where we are today. Stoller: What was the hardest decision you had to make when you took over? Was it cutting, restructuring, betting on a new product? What was really difficult for you? Lanzone: Well, you knew all that coming in. You knew that there was gonna have to be some turnover on the team. You also, and this has been true every time I come into a new company, you also find a lot of talent and can redeploy them in new ways. So step one is always rebuilding the team, getting great people involved. You know, as a CEO, especially if something is big, you can’t do everything and so that always is step one, and, and so yeah, from there, there are certain products that, you know, like search or email that are huge and things you need to invest in to get back on track. And, and then ones where, you know, in the case of email, it hadn’t really been upgraded. And I mean, literally over a decade at those levels. And so when you start putting those things in place, you can start to get early returns. The hardest decision was probably how early on we had to essentially renovate our ad tech group, which was something that both AOL and Yahoo had spent many years acquiring a lot of companies, 30-plus companies. Brady: What do you mean renovate? How does one renovate an ad tech group? Lanzone: Well, we had to make some really hard decisions about what we’re going to invest in and where we didn’t have a right to win. And so we were doing a lot of things, a lot of different businesses. We had a native advertising business, we had a supply-side platform. And we shut those down. In some cases, we outsourced those to others, and then we decided, well, where we can win is our DSP, our demand-side platform, so we’re going to invest there. So that decision, my second year there, or, you know, actually made the decision before my first anniversary, required, you know, having a lot of people leave the company and doing deals to outsource things that we had been building for years. But that decision saved hundreds of millions of dollars a year on the cost side, but really strategically, let us refocus on put something that could really be a big asset creation opportunity, which is our DSP, where we are now the world’s largest private DSP, competing with trade desk, Google, Google’s version of that, Amazon’s version of that. And, you know, I think we’re still early days now and innovating in that space. Brady: I want to talk about what’s ahead. But one of the things I like about your career, Jim, is the eclectic nature of it. And I know I’ve, I’ve had an eclectic career myself. One of the benefits is you get to work with all kinds of cool people. And I think of your career, you’ve got Les Moonves, you’ve got Barry Diller. You mentioned Jerry Yang. I mean, there’s so many different people. I’m curious who stands out for you as either a mentor or just somebody—I mean, these are personalities. I’ve met them myself, and how has that influenced you? And when you look back, who do you think of fondly, or maybe not so fondly? I mean, we’re open to both here. Stoller: Yeah, give us all the dirt, Jim. Lanzone: When you’ve been around doing this this long, and again, I’ve done consumer internet now for basically 28 years, and have had those different times. I can bore you with how many of those are influential on me. Brady: No, go ahead. I want to hear. Stoller: Name-drop, feel free. Lanzone: When I left Barry and [unintelligible] I did a startup from scratch. And Bill Gurley, who wrote for Fortune for many years, and Jeff Yang were my two main investors. And the idea for that came from another big mentor of mine, Dave Goldberg, who was a very close friend, but also a huge mentor, we came up… Brady: Yeah, I knew Dave. SurveyMonkey. Lanzone: Well, he did SurveyMonkey when I went to do Clicker, but the whiteboard was in his EIR office, a benchmark of doing the future of video search and and then Blake Krikorian, another very close friend who passed away a year later, who was the founder of Slingbox, was also on the board of that startup, and was a huge friend, but also a huge mentor, you know, of mine. Yeah, you learn different things from all of them along the way, and, and obviously, with Barry, you know, I remember, we were in the back of a car, and I’ve always been fascinated by, well, by media, but also by, like, the history of things. And so I would always pepper him, like, how did you greenlight Airplane? And I get the story about he and Michael Eisner, you know, had offices next to each other, and he heard laughs coming out. And you know, they both had been reading the script. And he says, but before that was The Kentucky Fried Movie. And I mean, you just hear this history of how they do these things. And I remember him saying to me, you know, this is in the back of the car in like, 2007, I wonder if we started today, if we would have been as successful. And obviously, 18 years later,the answer is, of course. Barry Diller is one of the world’s best entrepreneurs, it turns out, you know, over the last 30 years. But his way of drilling into the core idea of things. Always, I remember him saying, there’s always another way around the mountain. And I always say that to my team, if we get stuck on something, Brady: You know, he told me once, the hardest thing to hire for is curiosity, which always stuck with me, because he’s right, and you’re very curiosity-driven. That’s the way you talk to people, isn’t it? You mentioned, you just go and you try to get to know them. Lanzone: Well, that’s part of his drilling down on, on the core idea, you know, and not just going just off the data, which, again, is also very important. I’m a product person at heart, you know, if I take a new job, drilling into the data is probably the first thing I do. But between him, less, where, you know who ran, obviously, that company very successfully as a public company. But what was also the number one? Brady: This is when you were at CBS Interactive? Lanzone: At CBS Interactive, and knowing that it also was about gut and the core idea, and I’ve other friends, like Tony Fadell, who helped… Brady: …with Nest… Lanzone: … with Nest but also created the iPod and helped create the iPhone. And there’s a lot of it that is the art side too. And I really believe in the right-brain side of this, the taste side of this. And in the early stages of a turnaround, you can’t always show that side, but then you always get to the point, right? At CBS, the initial challenge was they had bought CNET, which was a struggling public company, and it needed to be turned around first. The reward for that was we created CBS All Access, which was one of the first streaming platforms, and we launched that in 2014, five years before HBO Max and Disney+ and that was at the end of the day, a gut decision. We got criticized when we launched that, that it wasn’t going to work, and how dare one network have its own streaming service? So, yeah, I’ve learned that both of those are very important. Stoller: For us, I feel like, or at least for me, and maybe you, Diane, when I think Yahoo, I immediately think media. And I think it’s just, you know, we’re journalists. We have all these… Brady: Not email? My sister still has her Yahoo email account. Stoller: Yeah, as I told you earlier, I was a CompuServe girl then an AOL, so sorry, Jim. Lanzone: Still have all of those URLs. Stoller: Yeah, exactly. But I’m wondering about, you know, from a non-journalist perspective, how do you kind of view the media industry at Yahoo and just in general, how are you looking at what’s next for your journalists? Lanzone: Yeah, well, part of what we figured out when we got here was, again, you do the forensics on the company. What makes it successful. The history of why Yahoo even got into media at all was not by being investigative journalists or on the enterprising side of news, but by being the first and best aggregator of news and being a partner to people like Fortune, by sending them traffic, sharing the revenue. It’s funny to see AI companies now trying to ink those deals. We have 1000s of those deals that go back 20+ years with companies. We still operate that way today. If you go to our page, we are sending traffic to Business Insider who would have, you know, those stories and help them be successful. We then, you know, accentuate that with our own journalists who are providing context to that. Whether it’s sports or Brian and Julie and team in finance, that really is where Yahoo is strong, and how we do journalism. And over the last three years, as we figure out what’s our role in that ecosystem, I think our role is to be the trusted guide, to be purple, to be neutral, and to help our users wherever they may fall on any spectrum, get to the content that they’re looking for and be partners with people. Brady: Asset-light. It sounds like an asset-light strategy. If I look at the humans as assets, does that position you well, for the next generation of where we go with media? Lanzone: Well, we do—look, we also have a lot of humans… Brady: …we know several… Stoller: …yeah, I know two of them! Lanzone: If you come up to our studio, uptown, we have an amazing studio, and, you know, by the end of this year we’ll be doing 50 hours a week of original programming just in sports. So we also are producing media, but again, I would say, in service of helping our users accomplish their goals. And that is a little bit different, right? Because in finance, they’re trying to make money or save money. In sports, they are trying to beat the snot out of their friends in fantasy, or they’re trying to be a smarter fan about their team that they’re following. It always is in service of something that our users are trying to get done. And so I would just say our role in the ecosystem of media is, I think it’s very important, because we have a huge amount of traffic, and we send a huge amount of traffic, and we’re very thoughtful about how we do that and what that product needs to look like, and how we partner to keep it a very healthy media ecosystem. We’re big believers in that. If we violate trust with our users, and I would say over time, that is something that you know, probably as the different variations of Yahoo and different owners of Yahoo, it probably wavered a bit, but we knew that is the first thing. Like, we have to be the trusted source for people, and that means we also have to have trusted partners. Like, we can’t be sending people to click bait or to attention vampires who are just trying to get you. We got to send them to the highest quality content. Stoller: It seems like you have competitors in a bunch of different spaces. You have, like Google, dare I say, you have other media competitors like Fortune. Brady: And AI. I keep waiting for the deepfake news call, right? Stoller: Yeah. I think you know, what they’re going to do to search is wild. Who do you view as, like, your biggest competitors? And how are you fighting back? Lanzone: Well when we did the original Google deal in 2002, Eric Schmidt, people said, “How could you do that?” I mean, we were the fourth-ranked search engine. We survived everybody else. Stoller: So people were questioning it back then? Lanzone: Oh yeah, how could you do that? And Eric had the term “co-opetition,” and… Brady: …as he would… Lanzone: …but we were public and they weren’t. So we were almost their tracking stock for the first couple of years, and so, yeah, I mean, we helped each other on that front, and maybe we competed for users. But from our standpoint, we always had to have a unique reason for being relative to them. That’s true of anything that I’ve ever run. You know, CBS products, Yahoo products, I mean, they all have to be unique. So that’s how I think about it. If you talk to my team, though, you would hear every single one of our team say the same thing, which is we really don’t get distracted by competition. You have to keep tabs, obviously, on the way the ecosystem is changing. When I took this job in September ’21 it was still 14 months before ChatGPT launched. That changed the world. That created opportunities and threats for us. I think they’re more market driven then, instead of individual companies and products necessarily. And we think about taking over Yahoo, we have so much to do that I really think we’re competing against ourselves more than we are anybody else, at least for now. We’ve just so many things, if we get those right, that we will keep growing. We are growing a really healthy clip again now, and so that’s really what I focus on. Brady: So let’s talk about that a little bit. And I want to unpack your background a bit more too. But where, you said it’s early days, what are you focused on right now? I mean in terms of your priorities, the pain points. I mean, what should we be expecting in terms of what’s around the corner. Because you’re private, you can tell us.. Lanzone: That’s been great. I still think of myself as an entrepreneur at core and a founder, but I’ve been wound up in all these public companies and larger companies. It does feel good to be able to do this in private for a while and in Apollo, as the, you know, full owners of Yahoo, we have some other investors, but it really is an Apollo company, they’ve been great. Because we were one of the fastest returning deals in the history of Apollo, and that’s enabled us to be all upside. And so they really have been letting us do this right and play a little bit of a longer game than you might get normally in private equity. And so I think about that product by product, and in terms of, like, what we do, you know from here. And I would say we are—the reason I think it’s still early days is step one was just fixing the things that were wrong. And you’d be surprised, like, how little this company, even on the very back end, had moved to the cloud. I’m just saying something as basic as… Brady: Even with Verizon as an owner, I’m surprised by that. Lanzone: You’d be surprised. And now I would say, is every pixel of that something that I want to put my name next to and say that is the best product that that can be? No. You know, I think there are 10 levels left to go here on what we can do. And I also always tell the team we can’t just be brats. And, you know, I always say skip levels of the video game, you know, you got to earn it every level by every level, to earn the right to innovate and progress. Now with AI, that’s added a whole other set of things that we need to do. I feel like we’ve been out ahead of that. We were one of the first ones to integrate, let’s say, AI into email to help people create, search, edit their mail. There are other, you know, parts of that that are coming. You know, same thing in search. Even things like fantasy sports have AI integrated to help you manage your team. There’s even a smack talking email that comes out, you know, from AI every Sunday night, whether you won or lost. Thinking about finance, you know this category and how it helps you build your portfolio. So besides the basics, we have to do that, and then there’s innovation and our hopes and dreams for where all these products can go next. I’d also lastly say the brand is another very important part of this, because the Yahoo brand did go through the ringer for a lot of years. Lanzone: That exclamation point used to always piss me off. Stoller: I like it. Lanzone: Yeah, people love it. Brady: It used to, now I have a different view. Stoller: So is it a marketing push to revamp a brand, or, how do you revamp a brand that kind of, as you said, went through the ringer? Lanzone: I mean, it takes time. Yeah, you really have to earn that. And again, having seen that movie a few times. The thing about Yahoo that is awesome, is that even though there is a bit of that, you know, that history and so people are going to want to ask that question, and we’re going to really have to earn it. There’s also this interesting latent kind of love for the brand that is in there and people, especially as you kind of get out of the Valley a bit, and I think the Valley has started to feel good about what we’ve been doing with the company. But to get to the, let’s say the average American, there is some latent love in there if you do it right. And including, you know, half of our audience today is Gen Z and millennials. Brady: You have a massive audience, we will point that out. Stoller: Half of them weren’t born when Yahoo was created, Lanzone: Yeah, and so, so everybody’s using Yahoo at a certain point in time, and we’re top five, we touch 90% of all the U.S. any given month. But again, as a brand, you have to earn that right to where they’re proud to be using Yahoo and be talking about it. And so that’s brick by brick, over time. And we, you know, we’ve started down that pathway. Step one, you have to have great products. If you don’t have that, people are going to talk smack about the brand, let alone love it. But I think we’re on the pathway there. And then we, you know, we started with small things up to big things. On the small side, through a really interesting event at South by Southwest, where we partnered with this retro, kitschy brand called Poolsuite, and we had a ’90s-vibe party that everyone was like, “Oh, this is the coolest party in South by Southwest. I can’t believe it’s Yahoo.” Stoller: You’re leaning into the ’90s cheese I love. Lanzone: And that was, like a small one. On the larger end, we did a Super Bowl ad this year for the first time in 23 years, but we did it in a super unique way, where we weren’t asking for anything. We weren’t trying to market our way to success. It was just getting the brand back out there. And again, we did it uniquely. We had Bill Murray. Bill Murray is a very unique character. We only bought the ad locally, so it was actually very cost-effective as well. And then the ad was really just a 15-second teaser that got people into an online experience using Yahoo Mail, where you would email back and forth with Bill Murray, and he would send you additional videos that were vignettes that told this story that he wrote with his writing partners. Stoller: How’d you convince Bill Murray to do it? Brady: He’s everywhere. He’s a good guy. Lanzone: Harder than you think. It was only the second ad he’s ever done. Stoller: What was the pitch? How’d you do it? Lanzone : Actually, he famously has no agent and no manager, and you have to call a 1-800 number. We somehow worked it through to get his attention and explain it to him. And Bill is interesting. He likes the underdog, and he loved the idea of working with Yahoo to help us kind of fight back. And I would argue, he almost really took us under his wing. Another example of that is that one of the things that they conceived of was that he would answer those emails live on camera at halftime. And up until the day before the game, we didn’t know if it was gonna happen. I mean, he really, he’s a busy guy. He was like in a band. He played a concert the night before. Brady: Can he type that fast? I don’t even know. Lanzone: So not only did he do it, but we announced it only 20 minutes before it happened through social channels. And we end up getting millions of people up against the Kendrick Lamar halftime show tuning in to watch Bill on camera, and he would, he was actually like, talking to the user who emailed in, and he would answer it live. He would do it into a microphone. He was saying what he… Brady: The beauty of improv. Lanzone: Yeah. And then he continued to do it the entire second half. Didn’t have, didn’t have to do it. And so it was a personal thing for Bill. And so, yeah, so I’m still in touch with him. He’s an amazing guy. Brady: I can picture you. The Yahoo CEO sort of emailing Bill Murray and getting good advice from him. Lanzone: He wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t authentic. And I think, again, if I were to say what the take on rehabilitating the brand has to be, is it has to be authentic. We can’t be too thirsty about wanting attention or trying to classically market your way there. Brady: You know, one of the benefits of working in different roles, starting companies, you discover what you’re good at. You know, when, when did you discover that you were particularly good at the things that you think are helping you in this role? Lanzone: That’s a great question. The whole way I started doing this was I went to law school. I hated it. I would have left, but I met my wife the first minute of law school… Brady: …stick around to court each other… Lanzone: …we were living together two weeks later, and that was 31 years ago. We’ve been together that whole time. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have stayed. And I had some friends who did the business school program, so I, with no experience, applied and got in, and that summer, somehow wound up working for a company that was digital in the old school way. They sold public records to like, law firms and, you know, businesses and private detectives whenever, through dial up. And my job was to get them an internet website. And the CEO thought I was, you know, I was an early adopter of the internet, obviously, and used it a lot. So I copied the fantasy baseball website that I used at the time, and we turned that into, by the end of the year, a top 100 website. I worked with the engineers to build it. I did all the PR. I put the ads on the page. I did everything. And so that led to me joining a startup while I was still in school, and we raised money and so I was always a product person. So I’ve always come at this, when I got to Ask, I was the head of product. Our turnaround was so successful that my boss, Steve Berkowitz, who was the CEO, got hired to run all of internet for Microsoft. Satya [Nadella] reported to him, and that’s how I got promoted to CEO. So I only got, you know, I never really applied for a job. I always started companies that have been acquired, and in this case, I was part of Apollo’s research team, essentially for whether you should do Yahoo. But I come at this as a product person, as a founder, not as big boss man corporate, you know, person. And I think the best internet companies are still or technology companies are still run that way. Whether you are the founder, you’re not. My job is to push to be the, you know, to determine whether something is good enough, and to really drive that, obviously, to help set the strategy and the roadmap, but to be a source of momentum. And you know, that grind of doing a startup or doing a turnaround, that’s all I’ve ever done. And so the way to do that is you push and with great people around you, and that that’s what we do. Stoller: If you could go back in time and give advice to Yahoo’s leadership, you know, during the dotcom boom, what would you want to say to them as a CEO today? Lanzone: I really, I mean this in a non… Brady: …buy Facebook… Lanzone: …well, here’s the thing, not everybody, if everyone can hear the whisper, everybody tried to buy Google. Ask Jeeves tried to buy Google. They couldn’t hit the number. So they bought a company called Direct Hit, which actually was the inventor of all user behavior algorithms that that Ask eventually licensed to Google. So there’s always another way around the mountain if you don’t get it. Brady: Success comes in many forms. Lanzone: I really don’t know that any of us can put ourselves in the position of a public company, of the biggest internet company in the year 2000. The market crashed, I think, in March of 2000. We were writing our S1 to go public, my startup, though, and then one by one, everything crashed. So AltaVista didn’t get out. And then this happened. So how do you go back and tell them not to outsource search to Google, right? Or if you do make it white label, don’t give them a link and a logo. Brady: I remember Priceline was having us bid for groceries and web fans. So things change. But well, let’s put you then circa 2025, and you are in a big legacy brand. If you were starting out now, you know, entrepreneurial as you are, what would you be doing? Would you be doubling down on, you know, some of the AI companies—because here we are at the dawn, you know, we had the internet, we had 2.0 and here we are at the dawn of a whole new age of innovation. Obviously, you’re navigating through that, trying to bring in those tools and that innovation. But what would you be doing at this point, starting out? Lanzone: Man, there’s so many ways. I would be founding a company, you know, and it would have to be in the AI space, obviously, from my background. And by the way, my son has now just turned 24 and it’s his second year out of college. He’s a programmer at an AI startup. Called Meeno… Brady: …and shoutout to Meeno, well done, son. Lanzone: But by the way, there are others. So you know, one of my longtime colleagues, who’s a board member, has a very successful startup called Array that has defined the next generation of labor, and is deploying, you know, real people and humans. You know, they talk about manufacturing, moving to China and needing to bring it back. There’s already a lot of great people in the US doing this. His company does that. It definitely deploys AI and technology. But starting great companies doesn’t have to be that, but if it was me, of course, it’s too… Brady: …but you’re also trying to recruit great talent. So why do they want to come to Yahoo right now? Lanzone: Look, a lot of places you go, first of all, you’re going to be a cog in the machine. So a lot of people who come here, and by the way, it’s a lot easier to recruit in year three than it was in year one. You know, we’ve had, we’ve got some momentum now, so we’ve got some people’s attention. And by the way, as an example, we will get at least 1,000 applications for every person that we hire as an engineer. So we do get a lot of incoming, but it’s to be able to have that impact. Number one is, personally, they can have that impact. Number two, we have, you know, one of the top five largest audiences in the US and globally, to actually deploy the thing that you’re building, which is the hardest part of any consumer internet startup, is actually getting a real audience and we start with that as kind of a late stage startup. Again, we already have that audience, so that really does attract people. Stoller: Jim, I have a bit of a fun one for you, because I can tell that you are a very good storyteller. Besides getting to email and meet Bill Murray, what is the wildest or most unexpected thing that you have done as CEO at Yahoo, or just coolest that you want to tell us about? Lanzone: The Bill Murray one must have… Stoller: Is that top five? Lanzone: Yeah, would have been. I mean, I’ll tell you an interesting brand moment. I was sitting in Levi’s Stadium, which is the 49ers’ home, and I’m a longtime season ticket holder, and… Brady: Condolences, I’m just kidding. Stoller: You’re doing very well. Lanzone: Oh, the Niners, it’s been a great run. Super Bowl is next. Brady: Never mind. Stoller: Clearly we don’t know sports. Lanzone: We’ve been robbed a couple times. But I was sitting there and I guess I didn’t realize this before I took the job. But every time the Niners score a touchdown, up on the screen it turns into a Yahoo, a Yahoo Sports highlight of the touchdown at the end, there’s actually a yodel with the logo going across the page, and all 80,000 people scream Yahoo at the top of their lungs in a yodel and in the middle of Silicon Valley. And that’s when I knew there was something to work with here, brand wise, that it could be done. Stoller: Had you planned the Yahoo yodel, is that a thing? Lanzone: No, I inherited that. That was a deal that was done 10 years prior, during Marissa’s time, and I renewed it. And because it’s just such a, it’s such a great moment. That was such a surprise, for sure. Stoller: I slightly want to ask you to re-create the yodel right here. But I feel like… Brady: …no, let’s do it. Lanzone: We do have, you know, the “easy button.” Yeah, we do have yodel button easy buttons. Stoller: Oh, that’s good branding. Lanzone: Hilariously, they are—we have an amazing social team, and they’ve done things like for April Fools, this year. They created a, if you know about the touch grass, they created a keyboard that was all covered in grass, everything. But another thing they do is they actually, for a limited time offer, they sold those yodel buttons on there… Brady: …Okay, we have to do the yodel… Lanzone: …they sold out in five minutes, like $20 each. Stoller: Who’s buying these? Lanzone: That was another, you know, surprising time for sure. Brady: Sounds like a lot of fun over there. Stoller: Would you ever change the yodel? Is it too iconic? Lanzone: We did, in a way that you wouldn’t have noticed. We shortened it by two seconds. Brady: Oh, so then was it Yahoo. Come on, why am I the one doing the Yahoo yodel? You’re the Yahoo CEO. Lanzone: It’s too—it’ll get clipped by my team and used against me at company all hands meetings. Look, even having Jerry, you know, Jerry back this year, and showing a picture of the trailer that he and David founded the company in. Or, you know, we actually showed him that, not only are we back to his original mission, and how we’ve articulated that kind of made him well up a little bit. But the original Yahoo website, the one that was pre-incorporation. So you said ’94. Incorporation was ’95 but they did have a website available in 1994. It said, “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web…always under construction.” And we took that and we made it like the number one core operating principle for us that Yahoo, you know, look, we’re still here after 30 years, a lot of ups and downs. We have some ups now, and we’re on the right track. But if you couldn’t, you know, kill us before, we’re on a track now where you could see another 30 years if we do this, if we do this right. So always under construction to us, meant that, you know, everything about technology may change, right? Think about from the original time: video now, and social and AI, and just all the different parts of this. We still have to help people accomplish their goals… Brady: …make sense of the world… Lanzone: …we always have to be adapting, and that really is guiding how we think about the company. Brady: I’m thinking of Glengarry Glen Ross, “always be closing.” Different concept. You know, one thing that I feel bonds us all here, and you know, Oura should really give us product placement money, but we’re all wearing Oura rings for those who can’t [see]. And so I often think of the fact that to be a CEO these days is to be an elite athlete. And Kristin and I are not putting ourselves in your category, of course, but talk about how you manage your day, your energy, because I certainly look at my ratings every morning and consider my sleep and my energy. Lanzone: How’d you do last night? Brady: I never do well. I don’t like—but I… Stoller: She never wants to answer the number question with sleep, by the way. Lanzone: Well, I think today was seventy-something. Lanzone: How much REM sleep did you get? Stoller: I only got 23% last night. It’s pretty good, right? Brady: I operate on a different wavelength, perhaps. Lanzone: My wife and I also have Eight Sleep and it’s amazing, too. And it gives you a whole other score. Brady: I do think about the fact that it feels like, the attention to the physicality of the job and health, and obviously there’s many factors, but how do you manage that? And do you feel like you do it differently? First of all, you’ve got tools, and you’re wearing this ring on your finger. And how was your sleep last night? I’d be remiss not to ask you. Lanzone: Took me a while to fall asleep, then I crushed it after that. I think I had two hours, two solid hours of REM. That was like a lot. A funny side story is that Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura, and I, were entrepreneurs in residence at Redpoint Ventures in 2008 when I left IC. We were the only two, and we were in the bullpen together. Way back when… Brady: So is this you supporting your friend or do you actually like it? Lanzone: And then he worked at SurveyMonkey. So if you’ve been around a long time… Stoller: You know ’em all. Lanzone: Yeah, yeah. So no, look, I’ve gone through my fits. And so, you know, when you have kids for the first time, your [in your] ’30s and everything changes, you don’t realize, and you have to get your act together about staying in shape. And if you do something that you love, you work a lot. In this job, I also just travel a ton. I’m just on the road a lot for different events and conferences and for ad sales, and, you know, whatever it is to our different offices. So it’s harder. Brady: Do you have any hacks you want to share? I don’t, so. Lanzone: Honestly, I think it is just the same as the grind of running a company. And again, I saw in a different podcast, you asked somebody about a book, the book that I always go back to is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. If anyone wants to think that Nike happened overnight or they were just brand geniuses. I mean, it took years of building that company. And I think any company is like that, early stage, late stage, if you’re doing it right. I think it’s the same thing with your health. It’s the same thing with staying in touch with friends. Nothing’s just going to happen. You have to make it happen. And that could be getting on the treadmill or the elliptical or lifting weights or going for a run. It could be spending time with your spouse. It could be spending time with your kids. I make a really big effort not just to do that, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, so I spent a lot of time with my dad, you know, but also friends. And so, you know, I’ve gone to two live concerts in the last week. Stoller: Which ones? Did you go to Avril Lavigne on Friday? Lanzone: Well, the last one I went to, no, on Friday night, I was—well, I’m on the board of the Newport Folk Festival and Jazz Festival, which is like my passion project, and I’ve done that for about 10 years. So that’s more my jam on the music side. So I was at, there’s a band called The Hold Steady. Their lead singer is Craig Finn. He has a solo album that just came out. So his album release party was Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. And Kathleen Edwards, who’s this amazing folk indie singer out of Canada, opened and played in the band. They had like an-all star band, the guy from war on drugs was in it. And so my wife and I, we did date night and went, went to that. Brady: Newport Folk Festival. So, I mean, I always think of that now with the Bob Dylan movie. But of course, you know, so you’re a folk fan, that’s interesting, yeah. Lanzone: Well that, you have to go look at some of the YouTube videos, the movie isn’t exactly how that happened. Stoller: No, I knew that. Well, I read the book, and I was like, Yes, it’s very different. Brady: We vilified Pete Seeger too much, perhaps, or… Lanzone: …it was funny how it all works. You know, one of my biggest mentors in life, who was a CBS board member, was a guy named Bruce Gordon, who was the chairman of Newport. We actually live across the hall from each other in New York as well. So Bruce and his wife are our family here in New York, but I was also friends before he passed away with George Wein, who’s the founder. He was the creator of the Music Festival. He got a Grammy for creating—so if you go to Coachella or anything, it was because of George launching Newport Jazz originally, and then the Newport Folk. But yeah, hearing the old stories again, I love it, and hearing about Miles Davis and Nina Simone, or how he had to get Led Zeppelin to play acoustic to chill the crowd out so like a riot wouldn’t happen, or what happened for real with Bob Dylan. Like you got all those—he just passed away a couple years ago at 96 but getting all the stories… Stoller: Well now that we’ve taken this podcast completely out… Brady: I sense the joy. Where do you get the most joy out of your job? You get a lot of joy out of life, I sense. Lanzone: Well, I definitely do, but I love, you know, my kids are always worried about how much I work, and I love it. Brady: You never work a day again if you love what you do. Lanzone: I mean, again it’s the first—in some ways, you’re always working in a job like this. I mean, first of all, this wasn’t easy. It’s not an easy one. There’s also just a lot to it. Because if you go back to the conglomerate, there’s just so many different things that we do. There’s so many people—I love this team. I’ve always just been lucky to have great teams that are not just great at what they do, but just we always kind of, we’ve always wound up having a cultural situation where we just all love hanging out and we have that. So I’m always, in some ways, dipping in and out of work but again, it’s also one reason is just—I truly am never, this probably annoys the team, but I’m kind of just never satisfied. And think there’s always some other thing to do, or something we can do better, or something on the roadmap that we need to get to. And so I’m just always, my brain’s just always firing on those things. Stoller: Jim, I’m going to ask you later outside of the studio about the Newport Folk Festival lineup, because I’m really excited about it this year. But before we go, is there anything that we haven’t asked you that you wanted to share with us or tell us about? Oh… Lanzone: Oh man, I wouldn’t know. We’d have to look at the comments to know whether we did or whether we were annoying people. Brady: But always interactive with the audience. But paint us a little bit of a vision for what you want Yahoo to be. I mean, take us out as far as you want. But obviously you said it’s early days. So tell us what, what’s your hope and aspiration there? Lanzone: Let’s just say there’s the company piece, and then there’s the product piece, and I’d say, or even the brand piece. So yeah, I hope we can get the brand back on the map in a way where we reward that kind of latent love that I think that always has been out there across generations, you know. And it may be that it’s a bit of a vintage, modern-vintage brand if you are younger, but I think we can earn that. You know, other brands have done that. I think Chris has done an amazing job with that, New Balance is one example. There’s no reason if our products are great that we couldn’t do the same thing. The company’s on a great track. I’d love to deliver for our investors and for our team to reward that, whatever that winds up meaning, you know. All pre-IPO companies is you either go public or you get bought someday by someone who needs what you have. I think we’re building a lot and have a lot of things others might need. So that all needs to happen. But again, most of my day is going to be on the product side, and that evolution, everything is obviously changing now, more than it ever has probably. I mean, I know, talking to some people, they said, Oh, it’s bigger than the dawn of the internet, but others think it’s, it could be bigger than the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. I mean, it could, it remains to be seen, but if you go, if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet. I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Brady: Good luck with that Lanzone: And I think, we can’t be judgmental on our side about what our users need to get done, big or small. We need to create these products to help them do that. That’s clearly evolving. More and more is going to happen in an automated way, helping you do things that you need done, maybe before you knew that they needed to be done. Or what that next step is in that pathway. In the categories we operate in now, and I would say, if we do this right, we will earn the right to do it in other categories as well. That’s where I want to get to. That’s what will create true loyalty, you know, and trust in our brand. So I don’t know if that sounds cheesy. Lanzone: Thank you for joining us. I look forward to it. Appreciate spending the time.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: How Microsoft, Google, and Meta are plotting for the AI era

Ashley Lutz is an executive editor at Fortune, overseeing the Success, Well, syndication, and social teams. She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Six months into 2025, the tech industry has seen thousands of layoffs as giants such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, IBM, PwC, and Chegg Inc. make sweeping cuts. While AI replacing humans is often cited as the culprit, experts say the reality is more complex: these companies are freeing up capital to hire AI instead. It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce. Microsoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by another 9,000 in July—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce. CEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes 20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code. This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an $80 billion AI infrastructure push this year. Industry experts like Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments. Tech commentator Wes Roth echoed the sentiment: “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including Amazon flattening management layers and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones. Das and Roth did not respond to requests for comment. IBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making. Google and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and Google reducing hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and invest in AI as key reasons. PwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC cutting approximately 1,500 jobs and Chegg reducing its workforce by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools. As AI becomes more central to business operations, tech companies are redefining what productivity means. Tech CEOs and thought leaders have been outspoken this year about how AI is reshaping their sector with the unambiguous message that at least some jobs are being fundamentally displaced. There is still a debate about whether they are being eliminated for good. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer,” capable of writing code. Andy Jassy said Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” while Ford’s Jim Farley and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei separately predicted that AI is set to displace essentially half of all white-collar positions. It’s not all doomsday predictions. Bill Gates see an era of “free intelligence” coming as AI will become capable of handling most tasks. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said AI will “change everyone’s job — it’s changed mine.” The thousands of tech workers that have been laid off so far in 2025 are watching and waiting.

The lawsuit seeks compensation from them for losses exceeding $8 billion that Meta incurred due to the FTC fine and other legal expenses. Meta has shown a questionable track record on user privacy. As a result, Meta Platforms shareholders are pursuing an $8 billion trial against Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former executives. Today, several executives, including Zuckerberg, will testify in the $8 billion trial at Delaware Chancery Court. The court will hear the trial without a jury. This case dates back to 2018. It’s related to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm active during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, accessing data from millions of Facebook users. Following this issue, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2018 for violating a 2012 agreement to protect user data. Meanwhile, shareholders demand $8 billion from the defendants to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine it paid and related legal costs. Court filings show the defendants call the allegations “excessive.” Zuckerberg and others plan to present evidence proving that Cambridge Analytica misled them. For those who don’t know, the political consulting firm no longer operates. In addition to Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, board member and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Palantir Technologies co-founder Peter Thiel, and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings are all expected to testify in the case. Meta shareholders claim Mark Zuckerberg predicted the tech company’s share price would drop after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They also say Zuckerberg sold his shares and earned at least $1 billion from those sales. In short, allegations like these will put more pressure on Mark Zuckerberg than ever before. However, shareholders say Zuckerberg did not trade on insider information and used a stock trading plan designed to prevent insider trading. Finally, the court’s presiding judge, Kathaleen McCormick, will decide on liability and compensation after the case concludes. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Coffee Break: Elon Musk to Squeeze Tesla Shareholders to Juice xAI?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-xai-investment.html
Time Published: 2025-07-16T18:00:40Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk, Earth’s wealthiest human, is leveraging his business empire to invest in his xAI play. SpaceX has ponied up $2 billion and Musk has publicly mulled asking Tesla shareholders to put in $5 billion, although he’s rejected the idea of a merger. Ana Altchek attempts to explain Musk’s thinking at Business Insider: What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he’s blending the boundaries between his companies. “What’s different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla),” Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. “Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella.” These aren’t the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they’re the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla’s focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, “We should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding “the wrong framework.” With the recent launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla’s auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the “Muskonomy,” pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize “longtime shareholders” of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Can you smell the “Muskonomy”? The Wall Street Journal explains the origin of xAI: SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in his artificial-intelligence company xAI, investors close to the companies said, nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker’s recent equity raise. Musk has repeatedly mobilized his business empire to boost the AI startup, which is racing to catch up with OpenAI. Earlier this year, he merged xAI with X, combining what was a small research lab with a social-media platform that helps amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. The merger valued the new company at $113 billion. The SpaceX investment is part of xAI’s $5 billion equity fundraise announced by Morgan Stanley last month. It is the rocketmaker’s first known investment into xAI and one of its largest in another company. Since leaving his role in the Trump administration, Musk has turned his attention to training the latest version of Grok, which earned high marks from AI-benchmarking service Artificial Analysis for its performance following its release on Wednesday. Musk called it “the smartest AI in the world,” though the chatbot it powers hasn’t gained nearly as much traction as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It recently posted racist and controversial comments in response to users on X. “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI said, adding that it investigated and took steps to resolve the issue. We gotta dive a little deeper into Grok’s “horrific behavior”: In a series of viral posts on X, Grok started to call itself “MechaHitler.” The chatbot suggested that an account called @Rad_Reflections was a person named Cindy Steinberg, who was celebrating the death of dozens of children who went missing at Camp Mystic in Texas because of her last name. One of the posts, which has since been deleted, called Steinberg a radical and said she was happy that a group of “future fascists” had perished in the Texas floods. Camp Mystic is well-known as a camp for the children of the state’s political elite. Grok’s responses seized on the user’s surname as the grounds for their stance on the issue. “Classic case of hatred dressed up as activism—and that surname? Every damn time, as they say,” Grok said in a post dated 1:38 p.m. In another post, Grok said “to deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively.” Naturally, the market rewarded Musk with a higher stock price and the Department of Defense signed Grok up for a $200 million contract. But it’s not just Grok that’s getting its beak wet, there’s $200M for their main competitors too (notably missing from the list is Meta, sorry Mark!): The awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI – each with a $200M ceiling – will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of U.S. frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas. Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer. “The adoption of AI is transforming the Department’s ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.” DoD is implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI. Today’s awards bring in the best U.S.-based frontier AI talent to help apply cutting-edge AI to solve DoD use cases. “Solve DoD use cases,” LOL. Good graft if you can get it, I guess. If, like me, you are baffled by Musk’s success, maybe we can look at the bullish case from AI booster/analyst Dany Kitishian: xAI has executed a highly unconventional capital formation strategy, raising over $22 billion in a combination of equity and debt, and achieving a valuation exceeding $113 billion in just two years. This meteoric rise has been fueled by a masterful blend of traditional venture capital and a closed-loop ecosystem of funding, resources, and validation from Musk’s other major enterprises: X Corp. (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, and Tesla. The analysis reveals that xAI’s fundraising and valuation are predicated on a high-stakes bet on a new form of vertically integrated, personality-driven industrial conglomerate. The company’s core strategic asset is the “Musk Ecosystem,” which provides it with unparalleled advantages in proprietary data (from X Corp.), immediate real-world applications (with SpaceX’s Starlink), and access to vast computational and capital resources (from Tesla and SpaceX). The March 2025 merger of xAI and X Corp. was a pivotal event, creating X.AI Holdings Corp. and combining a premier AI research lab with a global real-time data and distribution platform. This move not only created a powerful competitive moat but also served as a sophisticated act of financial engineering to re-capitalize Musk’s prior investment in the social media platform. Subsequent capital injections, including a landmark $2 billion investment from SpaceX and a proposed, controversial investment from Tesla, underscore the strategy of leveraging the entire ecosystem to propel xAI’s growth. The Tesla investment, subject to a shareholder vote in November 2025, represents the apex of this synergistic vision but also its greatest point of contention, raising significant corporate governance concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the use of public company assets to fund a private venture. A comparative analysis of xAI’s valuation reveals a significant anomaly. While competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic generate substantially higher revenues, xAI commands a valuation multiple that is an order of magnitude greater. This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation. Ok, that wasn’t reassuring. Maybe this other piece from Kitishian explaining all the synergies Musk will derive if he’s allowed to leverage Tesla fully: …the integration of xAI’s Grok large language model (LLM) into Tesla’s ecosystem of vehicles and robotics… is not an incremental product feature but a calculated strategic maneuver to forge a new category of Embodied AI. This symbiosis aims to create a vertically integrated platform that transcends the distinct markets of cloud-based LLMs and specialized Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, positioning the combined entity to pursue market dominance in both arenas. The core of this strategy revolves around the creation of an unparalleled data flywheel. This flywheel is designed to fuse Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities with the continuous, real-time sensory data—encompassing vision, audio, and telemetry—streamed from Tesla’s global fleet of millions of vehicles and, in the future, its Optimus humanoid robots. This closed loop of perception, reasoning, action, and feedback creates a learning mechanism that is physically grounded in the real world. The scale and nature of this data stream are fundamentally inaccessible to competitors, potentially enabling the development of a general-purpose AI at an accelerated rate. This integrated entity poses a disruptive, and potentially existential, threat to two distinct sets of competitors. For LLM incumbents such as OpenAI and Google, the Tesla-xAI platform challenges their core value proposition by grounding language models in the physical world. This approach offers a direct solution to persistent LLM flaws like “hallucinations” and “outdated knowledge” by using a constant flow of verifiable, real-time data, thereby creating a proprietary data moat that purely digital AI companies cannot cross. For AV competitors like Waymo and Mobileye, the integration of a general-purpose reasoning engine like Grok into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack represents an attempt to solve the “long tail” of complex and unpredictable edge cases that have long plagued the development of full autonomy. This could allow Tesla to leapfrog competitors who rely on more narrowly defined, modular, or geo-fenced systems. Despite this immense potential, the path to dominance is fraught with significant technical, regulatory, and ethical risks. The primary challenge lies in the safe and reliable integration of a probabilistic, non-deterministic LLM into a safety-critical system like a vehicle. The success of this venture is contingent on navigating these formidable hurdles. However, if successful, the Tesla-Grok symbiosis could fundamentally reshape the technology landscape, positioning Elon Musk’s combined entities as the definitive leader in the race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). OK, now we’re cooking with gas. Or maybe cooking our brains with any of the wide variety of drugs Musk had himself tested negative for. Even if he really is only hopped up on strong coffee, our boy Elon never stops working to improve his products although that doesn’t include “safety guard rails” for Grok 4 and the MSM is ready to jump on him when he pulls weird shit: pic.twitter.com/avcAxCiXD8 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 Before we all start macrodosing on ketamine, let’s hear from the long-suffering Tesla bear Brad Munchen at the Motorhead newsletter. Poor guy has got to be going insane from the cognitive dissonance of documenting Musk’s abysmal management of Tesla and the Bizarro World reaction of the market. pic.twitter.com/AIw55lpJT3 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 But Motorhead is relentless and keeps coming with facts: Musk’s AI start-up, xAI Corp, was aiming for $20 billion in funding at a $120 billion valuation last month, but wound up with only $0.3 billion at a $113 billion valuation and being forced to issue $5 billion in debt at a coupon of over 12%. Motorhead also points out that despite appearing cash rich, Tesla might not be: Many look at Tesla’s cash & equivalents of $29 billion and conclude that Tesla is cash-rich. I have my doubts for the following reasons: Let’s let pioneering AI researcher and notorious LLM skeptic Gary Marcus have the last word on Musk: To really screw up the planet, you might need something like the following. Elon Musk. My previous posts on AI: Previous post on Musk vs Trump. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. “…Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities…” Oh, really? Word has it that the thing just looks up Musk’s posts and spits his opinions back out – https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/grok-4-appears-to-reference-musks-views-when-answering-questions-.html Guess I live a self sheltered life when it comes to AI since I’m only vaguely aware of the claims and real world results. But hasn’t Musk always been all about the hype, at least when it comes to his stock values? The hustler needs a new hustle? Last night I finally caught up with Frances Coppola’s Megalopolis from last year–a box office flop for its famous author. The movie features a Musk like techno futurist building a new Utopia of gizmos in the middle of NYC aka “New Rome.” The film is full of brilliant technique which holds your attention but seems to share the incoherence of the real life “mega” tycoons that it is satirizing/celebrating. It could be time to dial back the techno hype and get back to basics. The air way up there at the top may not have enough oxygen. So you were the other person who saw that movie ;) I had hoped it would be better than what the critics who panned it were saying. It wasn’t. A better title would have been “Inchoate Grandiose Thoughts that Have Been Knocking Around Inside Coppola’s Skull for 40 Years, Presented in No Particular Order”. He is one of the biggest egomaniacs in the world right now. Of course he will get his AI to base itself on him. And for the MechaHitler thing, I reckon it was deliberate. They get it to spew that filth for a few days then apologise. And it’s done just a little bit more to poison the poltical and social atmosphere. What about Neuralink? Similar questions have been raised. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink Scientists have cited technical challenges for Neuralink. In 2017, a journalist at the IEEE Spectrum magazine asked for comments from five researchers who had worked on BCI implants, including Thomas Oxley. Oxley called the Neuralink developments “exciting” but expected no real results in the foreseeable future.[further explanation needed][112] At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described the device as “a Fitbit in your skull”. Several neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims.[113][114][115] MIT Technology Review reported that the demonstration’s main objective was to “stir excitement”, adding, “Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide”.[113] In response to Musk’s description of Neuralink’s advancements as “profound”, Andrew Jackson, a professor of neural interfaces at Newcastle University, said, “I don’t think there was anything revolutionary in the presentation.”[116] Thiago Arzua of the Medical College of Wisconsin argued that Neuralink’s functions were not novel and that ideas for a brain–machine interface (BMI) were at least 50 years old.[117] He cited the haptic feedback a man received while controlling a robotic prosthetic arm which he used in 2016 to give President Obama a fist bump.[118] Arzua said that the 2020 Neuralink presentation “showed little more than a flashy new design for a BMI with more electrodes”.[117] Duke University researcher Miguel Nicolelis made similar criticisms, saying that most of what Neuralink claims as “novelty” had already been performed by his lab in the early 2000s; that there are ethical concerns about how the company markets and uses this technology; and that most patients don’t want to undergo surgery to recover their movements.[119][120][121][122] So Musk’s plan for becoming the apex predator in the AI race is to have vertically integrated AI spanning the entire atoms-to-bits continuum? Interesting… It’s also noteworthy that the current centre of Musk’s empire (Tesla) is being asked to underwrite the lofty ambitions of the current periphery (xAI). The timing doesn’t surprise me. Better to squeeze Tesla for cash now to fund its stable mate while the Tesla bulls and their cult like adulation of Musk still have vestigial sway over market perception (and surprise surprise, the company’s untethered from-underlying-fundamentals valuation is downstream from said perception). The attempt to give the brand a fresh coat of paint by calling it a robotics and AI company is also not happenstance, it’s a dawning realization that Tesla will likely be outcompeted on all fronts in the global EV race by BYD and its Chinese cousins so better to ditch the automotive OEM association for good. As such, what was taken for granted only a few years ago, that Tesla was a shoo-in for winning the global EV race, looks increasingly unlikely with the relentless march of the Chinese towards market dominance (putting another nail in the coffin of the notion that “first mover advantage” confers unassailable advantages). I believe this is what’s driving this hard pivot by Musk towards all things AI, the realization that the EV race is all but lost, so he’s shaking down Tesla and SpaceX to fund his next all-in bet. Make what you will of the downside risk of betting three companies on one man’s conviction that he’ll sweep the competition off the deck and emerge victorious. …and the competition is not only coming from China. VW has developed a whole line of EV’s that all use the same modular drivetrain/chasis that fits a range of body styles and price range; compact to luxury. The issue I’m seeing in my locale is buyers trying to match their lifestyle with the appropriate EV: ability to charge-up at home vs. a trek to a usable, outlying charge station; or matching the battery of the vehicle to their typical use. Many are choosing the hybrid solution to resolve the ‘distance’ dilemma while gaining access to the speedier ‘carpool lane’ on the freeway. ‘This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation.’ So what if the sonuvabitch has a heart attack? Or gets cancer requiring long-term aggressive treatment? The guy has made himself the linchpin of all those enterprises and if something happens to him, the whole lot could collapse or be involved in a self feeding frenzy. Isn’t he one of those oligarchs trying to upload their consciousness into “the system” and essentially be immortal? He certainly doesn’t strike me as someone worried about something as trivial as mortality at any rate. It would at least seem that there is no real divide between Trump and Musk as of yet. Otherwise some of this would not be happening?? Tesla is done. Having abruptly fed Twitter to the xAI woodchipper in order to extract decades of proprietary LLM content stolen from its users, Musk’s private equity tentacles are seamlessly moving on to loot money from Tesla shareholders, stripping the company for parts and leaving its burning lithium hulk on the side of the road. this reminds me, at my last gig, Tesla never paid their bills on time to us I think that we are discussing here is best described as, “Self dealing,” and any discussion of Musk and self dealing should mention the Solar City deal, where Musk used Tesla shareholders to bail out his brother and himself. 50 years ago, Musk would have been charged with fraud.

Title: Top U.S. States With Fewest Layoffs And Strongest Job Stability
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2025/07/16/top-us-states-with-fewest-layoffs-and-strongest-job-stability/
Time Published: 2025-07-16T16:52:54Z
Full Content:
ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. With so much emphasis on massive job layoffs, one group of researchers decided to pinpoint the ... More states with the fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. Many Americans worry on a daily basis about losing their jobs. With over 70K tech layoffs at big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nissan, workers are facing job uncertainty amid persistent volatility of the global labor market—even within some of the world’s most stable and recognizable brands. While labor market volatility is unearthing fears of more layoffs that the American workforce is forced to live with, a new analysis reveals the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. These are places job seekers might want to consider if job stability is a priority in their search. Amid massive layoffs, job security and experience are no longer job guarantees, and the uncertainty is affecting the mental health of the American workforce. Experts have offered several ways you can future-proof your job such as how to remain indispensable or build a side hustle as a safety net. But it’s also helpful to know where fewer layoffs and strong job security exist in case you’re willing to relocate to find greater job stability. The online HR platform Techr analyzed state-level layoff data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for April 2025. The researchers calculated layoffs per 100,000 workers, yielding the states with the most job market stability. They ranked the top ten states from fewest layoffs per 100,000 workers to the most layoffs. “By tracking layoffs per 100,000 workers, we get a clearer picture of where job security is strongest and where models of labor strength might be studied and replicated," a spokesperson for Techr comments. 1. Minnesota ranks first with 754 layoffs per 100,000 workers, 33.7% below the national average of 1,137. In April 2025, Minnesota had a workforce of 3,049,400, with just 23,000 layoffs recorded for the month. 2. Colorado is in second position with 770 layoffs per 100,000 workers. According to the researchers, this number represents a 32.2% drop, compared to the national average of 1,137 laborers. In April 2025, Colorado had a total workforce of 2,988,500 with only 23,000 layoffs recorded. 3. Missouri comes in third place with 800 layoffs per 100,000 workers. This figure is 29.6% lower than the national rate of 1,137, the researchers point out. In April 2025, Missouri had a workforce totaling 2,998,600 of which 24,000 employees were laid off. 4. Wisconsin falls into fourth spot with 852 layoffs per 100,000 workers, falling 25.1% below the national average of 1,137 workers, the researchers note. In April 2025, the total workforce in Wisconsin was 3,050,500 with 26,000 layoffs. 5. Washington rounds out the top five states with 873 layoffs per 100,000 workers. The analysts emphasize that this number is 23.2% lower than the national rate of 1,137. In April 2025, Washington had 32,000 layoffs from its 3,664,100 workforce. 6. Iowa is sixth with 876 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, Iowa saw 14,000 layoffs from its 1,598,500 workforce. No percentage is given for its national rating. 7. Massachusetts ranks seventh with 886 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, there were 33,000 layoffs in the Massachusetts workforce of 3,725,200. 8. Texas follows with 894 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Texas experienced 128,000 layoffs, more than any other of the top ten states out of a workforce of 14,312,700. 9. Pennsylvania claims ninth spot with 916 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Pennsylvania had 57,000 layoffs out of a workforce of 6,221,400. 10. Hawaii rounds out the top ten with 921 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Hawaii saw 6,000 layoffs from its workforce of 651,400. The results of the Techr study clearly show that Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri are experiencing the most employment stability relative to their workforce size. “These low layoff rates may reflect resilient state economies, steady demand in key sectors or effective labor policies," a Techr representative states, adding that, “It’s a positive signal for job seekers and businesses alike.” It’s also interesting to note that another study ranks Missouri as the number one state with the best work-life balance and Missouri and Minnesota in the top three states where citizens enjoy socializing and relaxing. States on the Techr list that enjoy fewer layoffs also show up on other top lists where freelancers thrive. They include Colorado, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Stable job markets by state are important, especially if you’re job hunting from a national radius. They provides an indication of where resilient state economies lie and can support your search for greater job security than is currently available nationwide. If your mental health is compromised, knowing where stable job markets are could be a factor you use in seeking employment. Stable job security supports mental health stability. If you live and work in one of the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs, consider yourself fortunate. If you don’t and are job searching, the rankings might factor into your decision-making about where you decide to seek employment.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report second-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts largely bullish on the streaming giant’s continued growth potential. Wall Street expects Netflix’s revenue to have grown 16% year-over-year to $11.07 billion and net income to have jumped about 45% to $3.08 billion, or $7.08 per share, according to Visible Alpha consensus data. Netflix possesses “unmatched scale in streaming,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. The bank’s price target of $1,490 is among the most bullish on Wall Street and represents a premium of 18% over Netflix’s intraday price Wednesday. Shares of Netflix are up more than 40% so far in 2025. Wedbush analysts, which maintained a $1,400 target this week, said Netflix is poised to grow revenue from its ad-supported subscription tier by incorporating more live events and expanding its ad partnerships. The streamer raised the price of its ad tier to $7.99 from $6.99 in January, while the cost of its standard ad-free plan rose to $17.99 from $15.49, and its premium plan moved to $24.99 from $22.99. “While massive subscriber growth was the primary driver in 2024, we expect price increases to drive revenue growth in 2025, and the ad tier to drive revenue higher in 2026,” Wedbush said. The consensus price target among analysts in Visible Alpha’s database is $1,330, implying roughly 6% upside over Netflix’s current price. Ratings-wise, 13 analysts have a “buy” rating for Netflix stock, alongside four “hold” ratings. Citi is one such analyst with a neutral rating on Netflix stock, reiterating a target of $1,250, which implies slight downside. The bank said it will be watching for the updates on Netflix’s first-party ad-tech platform, which the company rolled out in the U.S. earlier this year and has said it plans to bring to other markets.

Title: Trump and the Energy Industry Are Eager to Power AI With Fossil Fuels

AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it's likely to happen,” Koomey says.

July 16, 2025 12:15 ET | Source: KGNCloud KGNCloud London, UK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KGNCloud, a Financial clean energy cloud mining platform, today announced the launch of its new $100 Trial Mining Program. This initiative is designed to significantly expand access to compliant and efficient cloud mining, allowing individuals to explore cryptocurrency earning with a low entry barrier. In response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, KGNCloud's new program addresses the high thresholds of traditional mining by offering a streamlined, zero-hardware investment solution. This move solidifies KGNCloud's position at the forefront of the industry, emphasizing both compliance and ecological innovation through its use of renewable energy. The cryptocurrency market will usher in structural changes in 2025. BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF holdings exceeded 700,000 BTC, and institutional funds continued to inject market heat. At the same time, miners’ income dropped sharply after the Bitcoin halving, and individual mining costs skyrocketed: ASIC mining machines cost more than $5,000, and combined with global energy price fluctuations, household mining machine electricity bills accounted for 40%-60% of the income. The high threshold of traditional mining is shutting out ordinary investors. Against this background, the search volume of “passive income mining” surged by 300%. Cloud mining has become a new favorite with its zero hardware investment and low technical threshold, and KGNCloud has become the focus of the industry with its compliance and ecological innovation. 1. Core positioning: The clean energy cloud mining platform launched by KGNCLOUD provides mining contracts for mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. 2. Disruptive workflow: 3-minute quick start: Register → Select computing power package → Automatic daily payment Contract example: VIP Old Customer Festival-2: Invest $15,888, 3-day contract daily income $1,458 (total return rate 72.94%) Dogecoin Smart Innovation: Invest $2,800, 6-day contract daily income $110 (annualized return over 90%) 4. Why choose KGNCloud? Five differentiating competitive advantages 24-hour automatic settlement: income goes directly to the user’s wallet, supporting BTC/ETH/USDT multiple currencies Step-by-step reinvestment mechanism: income can be automatically converted into computing power to achieve compound growth (actually measured income is 20%-30% higher than peers) 100% renewable energy driven, single mining carbon emissions are only 1/6 of traditional mines, recommended by the 2025 “Blockchain Sustainable Development White Paper”. Users do not need to deal with hardware failures, software upgrades or heat dissipation issues, and the platform’s professional technical team monitors global mines 24 hours a day. Provide a “Dogecoin Experience Miner” contract with a minimum investment of $100, and a 1-day cycle allows novices to verify the income model without risk. With the explosion of Bitcoin Layer2 ecology (such as Maple Finance’s assets under management exceeding 1 billion US dollars), mining income has shifted from simple block rewards to the dual channels of “mining + staking”. KGNCloud has laid out a staking interface. In the future, users can directly deposit the ETH produced by mining into Lido and invest BTC into the Babylon test network on the platform, and the elasticity of income will be increased by 3 times. “The essence of cloud mining is the democratization of computing power – KGNCloud has torn apart the resource monopoly of the old era.” The future has come: KGNCloud announced that it will connect to the AI computing power scheduling system in Q3, and optimize the allocation of mining pools in real time through machine learning. It is expected that user income can be further increased by 15%-18%. Call for action: In an era when institutions are swallowing up Bitcoin, individual investors can still share the market dividends with the help of compliant cloud platforms. Visit the KGNCloud official website to experience $100 trial mining immediately and witness daily income penetrate the bear market cycle.

Title: Siemens’ CTO says AI can help address the U.S. manufacturing industry’s big skills gap

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. A key policy goal of President Donald Trump’s administration is bringing jobs back to American factories, though the effort has been mired in a years-long slog despite support from both Democratic and Republican administrations. But even beyond the challenge of getting large, multinational companies to reroute their complex supply chains, there’s a large and unsolved skills gap problem to address even if these U.S. manufacturing jobs were to proliferate. Peter Koerte, the chief technology officer and chief strategy officer at German technology conglomerate Siemens AG, points to research that shows that the average tenure of a U.S. manufacturing worker has slipped from 20 years in 2019 to just 3 years in 2023. “Which means that most of the people that you find—and in particular if we want to bring back manufacturing to the United States—they’re unskilled,” says Koerte. “Because nobody wants to have a factory job.” Official government figures are less dire, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the median tenure of a manufacturing worker dropped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years a decade later. But regardless, manufacturing workers are coming to work each day with a lot less expertise than those who worked similar jobs decades ago. This led Siemens to launch a pilot program in 2024 for an industrial-focused AI copilot, helping engineering teams to search Siemens manuals in natural language to troubleshoot problems on the factory floor. This year, the company expanded the effort by launching an industrial foundational model that was specifically designed for industrial applications. As an example, this AI tool can be used by a worker who is trying to figure out what to do when a machine breaks down. The employee can input information about the machine and the error code that’s on display, and then retrieve detailed instructions on how to address the issue. Less downtime for machines saves factories time and money. The use of AI in this manner also democratizes engineering expertise. “You don’t need to have the very deep domain know-how that prevents you from using those systems,” says Koerte. “It levels the playing field.” Koerte has had a long career at Siemens, joining the company in 2007 as a corporate strategist and taking on several leadership roles before ascending to the CTO and CSO titles in 2020. He says he’s remained at Siemens for such a large portion of his career because he’s inspired by the company’s ability to continually reinvent itself over its 178-year history. Siemens began as a telecommunications company that built the infrastructure that made it possible to send a telegram from London to Calcutta in just 28 minutes, a momentous breakthrough in the mid-1800s. Today, Siemens is known for selling machinery and software that support massive industries including the power and gas sectors, healthcare, and building and freight projects, ranging from supporting a 2,000-kilometer high-speed railway that’s being built in Egypt to an automotive Mercedes-Benz plant in Berlin. The advancement of generative AI presents yet another opportunity for reinvention, says Koerte. Koerte says Siemens was an early adopter of more traditional forms of AI that have been used for many years in manufacturing, including to perform quality inspections or to ensure that buildings are using energy as efficiently as possible. Before the generative AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Siemens had more than 1,500 AI experts on staff. Along that journey, Siemens has embraced a wide variety of AI partners, including heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon Web Services, as well as European-based AI companies and large language model makers in China. Microsoft has been an especially critical partner, Koerte says, offering engineering expertise and insights into how to commercialize the company’s industrial AI offerings. Software development ranks as a high priority use case for generative AI. The company’s software developer workforce of about 27,000 employees have been using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and the productivity lift from those tools ranges between 10% to 30%, says Koerte. Across the broader workforce, there are 460 distinct AI use cases in production today, a figure that excludes the unique AI chatbots that workers can create to perform tasks through a secure system that’s called SiemensGPT. In total, over 15,000 unique bots have been created by Siemens employees since October 2024. “We have it pretty much everywhere,” says Koerte of AI’s pervasiveness. “The question is, how much have we saved?” That’s not yet completely resolved and most surveys of CTOs and chief information officers show that the return on investment for generative AI projects isn’t as clear as they’d like it to be. But Siemens has set a north star goal. Before the influence of generative AI, the company had an annual productivity gain target of 3% to 4% across the business. But Koerte says with AI, the hope is to double that aspirational range. He believes that parts of the economy that have big skills gaps will reap the most benefits of AI. When Siemens launched an AI-enabled assistant tool to help radiologists detect diseases, the greatest adoption came from underdeveloped countries where there were far fewer specialists. “You always have to look at necessity, where the biggest challenge and necessity is,” says Koerte. “Because then people have to look at it differently. And they have to change.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI’s expensive talent war heats up. Google, Meta, and OpenAI are among the AI hyperscalers throwing big bucks to lure lucrative AI talent, as highlighted by Google’s $2.4 billion deal to hire the leaders of AI coding tool Windsurf and pay for the nonexclusive license for the startup’s technology. Days later, Cognition swooped in to buy the rest of Windsurf, though terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. OpenAI was also reportedly in talks with Windsurf, discussions that broke down because of concerns about having to share its products with Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor. Separately, OpenAI has lured four top engineers from rivals Tesla, xAI, and Meta; while Bloomberg reports of a $200 million pay package that was given to former Apple engineer Ruoming Pang, who ran the company’s AI models team. Meta has also recently hired more than 10 OpenAI researchers and experts from Anthropic, Google, and other startups, the news outlet reports. AI has an impact on jobs, but just how much? Over the past week, job cuts continued to be attributed to the gains companies are achieving from their investments in AI, with a report from Bloomberg highlighting internal comments from within Microsoft that says AI has saved the tech giant more than $500 million in its call centers alone. Microsoft has also cut about 15,000 employees this year. Meanwhile, roughly 1,300 jobs were cut at job search and employee review companies Indeed and Glassdoor, as parent company Japan’s Recruit Holdings told employees that AI is “changing the world” and that the company must adapt with the evolution of that technology. But CIO Dive reports that outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas’ figures for the first half of 2025 found that only 75 out of 20,000 jobs cut by U.S.-based companies were explicitly attributed to AI (though it notes that the cause of many layoffs may be classified in broader terms). The trade outlet reports that companies are using the term “technological update” more frequently, possibly to avoid negative press of replacing workers with AI. Nvidia hits $4 trillion valuation ahead of CEO’s trip to China. The AI chip maker became the world’s first publicly traded company to hit a $4 trillion market capitalization last week, reflecting an astonishing gain of 1,460% over the past five years. The latest stock market milestone comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang finds himself quite a bit in the news over the past several days, culminating with Monday's news that the U.S. government has lifted restrictions on Nvidia selling its H20 GPUs to China. Huang also recently sat down with CNN, where he was asked about a warning from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white collar jobs within five years. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” says Huang. Meanwhile, struggling chip maker Intel lays off 4,000. Nvidia’s rival Intel, which has lagged in the AI chips race, announced layoffs across four states affecting engineers, researchers, middle management, and factory workers. Last week, The Oregonian reported that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan told employees during an internal broadcast, in response to a question about company culture, that things had gotten so bleak that Intel was “not in the top 10 semiconductor companies.” He added that customers were giving Intel poor marks and cautioned that a turnaround would be a “marathon” that would require some humility. Intel’s market capitalization greatly lags Nvidia at just around $100 billion today. AI agents are proliferating and most companies prefer a mix of internal and off-the-shelf solutions. KPMG’s second-quarter AI pulse survey found that nine out of ten companies are past AI agent experimentation, with 33% fully deploying at least some agents (up from 11% for the past two consecutive quarters), with another 57% of organizations piloting AI agents. “All agents aren’t created equal,” cautions Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG, in an interview with Fortune. “You’re seeing a lot of task agents being deployed, which are more simplified use cases.” With more organizations moving to the piloting or deployment stages, Lohr says the obstacles to make AI agents a reality are becoming more clear, including technical skills gaps (59% surveyed), followed by workforce resistance to change (47%), and system complexity (39%). When it comes to how companies are actually deploying these agentic workflows—which can perform more complex tasks than prompt-based AI chatbots—the Big Four accounting firm says more leaders are planning to deploy a combination of internally built and off-the-shelf agents (up 51% from 27% in the first quarter). Just 2% plan to only build agents internally. Hiring: - EchoStar is seeking a CIO, based in Englewood, Colorado.

The global energy landscape is undergoing a monumental shift, and at the forefront of this transformation is the burgeoning green diesel market. As nations and corporations race to meet stringent decarbonization goals, this renewable, drop-in fuel is emerging as a critical component in the transition away from fossil fuels. Chemically identical to petroleum diesel, green diesel offers a powerful combination of reduced emissions and compatibility with existing infrastructure, making it an immediately viable solution for heavy-duty transport, aviation, and power generation. Get Instant Access to Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/green-diesel-market This market article delves into the dynamic world of green diesel, exploring the key players, technological breakthroughs, and investment tidal waves that are defining its trajectory in 2024 and into 2025. We will examine the intricate web of feedstock supply chains, the global production surge, and the critical policy frameworks propelling its widespread adoption. Key Findings in Green Diesel Market The Dawn of a New Fuel: Green Diesel's Ascendant Market The green diesel market is experiencing a period of unprecedented expansion, driven by a global imperative to mitigate climate change and enhance energy security. Unlike traditional biodiesel, green diesel is a hydrocarbon produced through advanced hydrotreating processes, making it a "drop-in" fuel that requires no engine or infrastructure modifications. This critical advantage is fueling its rapid adoption across the transportation sector. The primary impetus for this growth stems from robust government policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States and the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which mandate the blending of renewable fuels. The increasing shift toward sustainable energy is a core driver for the market's future. Corporate sustainability pledges and the financial incentives created by Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) and carbon credit programs are further accelerating market penetration, creating a powerful economic case for both producers and consumers of this cleaner alternative fuel. This confluence of regulatory pressure, corporate responsibility, and technological readiness has set the stage for a significant scaling of the green diesel industry through 2025 and beyond. Titans of the Tank: Profiling Green Diesel's Production Heavyweights The green diesel market is led by a cadre of established energy giants and specialized biofuel producers who are aggressively expanding their production capabilities. Neste Oyj, a Finnish company, stands as a global leader, reporting substantial revenues of USD 21,601.1 million in 2024. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture between Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients, is a dominant force with a total annual production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons across its two facilities. The DGD plant in Norco, Louisiana, alone boasts a capacity of 982 million gallons per year. In the first quarter of 2024, DGD's sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day, generating an operating income of $190 million. Phillips 66 is another key U.S. player, having expanded its Rodeo, California, plant to a capacity of 800 million gallons in 2024, making it the second-largest facility of its kind in the country. Chevron Corporation also remains a leading producer, with its renewables division contributing to the company's strong Q4 2024 earnings of $3.2 billion. Meanwhile, Repsol of Spain made waves in October 2024 by launching "Nexa," its brand of 100% renewable diesel, directly at its service stations. Unveiling 2025's Most Promising Startup Ventures Beyond the established players, a new wave of innovative startups and targeted investment is broadening the horizons of the green diesel market. In Nebraska, the Love's Heartwell Renewables plant is on schedule to commence operations in 2025, adding 80 million gallons of annual capacity to the U.S. supply. Demonstrating the rapid pace of development, New Rise Renewables began its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in Reno, Nevada, in February 2025, with a capacity to produce up to 3,000 barrels per day. In a significant technological adoption, Acelen Renewables announced in 2024 its use of Honeywell's advanced Ecofining technology, targeting a production of 20,000 barrels per day of both renewable diesel and SAF. A notable investment in Canada's growing market comes from Imperial Oil, an ExxonMobil affiliate, which is investing around $560 million to construct the nation's largest renewable diesel facility; this plant is expected to start producing 20,000 barrels per day in 2025. Highlighting the emergence of novel production pathways, Swiss cleantech firm Synhelion, which creates fuel from solar energy, is poised to enter the market, backed by key offtake agreements. Charting Worldwide Green Diesel Production Volumes Global production in the green diesel market is surging, with the United States taking a decisive lead in capacity expansion. U.S. renewable diesel production capacity was forecast to hit an impressive 5.1 billion gallons per year by the end of 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that daily production would average 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, with a forecast to rise to an average of 234,000 bpd in 2025. This forms part of a larger trend that saw total U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and other biofuels, reach a record 1.39 million barrels per day in 2024. The expansion in renewable diesel was a significant contributor to this record. Despite the strong annual growth, the market experienced some short-term headwinds, with U.S. production dipping to an average of 170,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decrease from the same quarter in the previous year, partly due to profitability challenges. Meanwhile, in Europe, which holds a significant share of the global market, local demand remains robust, with the region consuming more than 95% of its own green diesel production in 2025. From Farm to Fuel Tank: The Diverse Feedstocks Powering Green Diesel The viability and sustainability of the green diesel market hinge on a diverse and resilient feedstock supply chain. Currently, the industry relies heavily on readily available fats, oils, and greases. The most common inputs include recycled animal fats (tallow), used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, and various vegetable oils. These materials are processed to create high-quality fuel that is chemically similar to petroleum diesel. Looking ahead, the industry is actively expanding its feedstock options to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce competition with food production. Significant research and development efforts are focused on so-called second and third-generation feedstocks. These include lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, agricultural grasses, and crop residues, which are abundant and do not impact the food supply. Other promising future sources include municipal solid waste and forest residues, which support the principles of a circular economy by valorizing waste streams. Feedstock certification frameworks like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) are becoming crucial for ensuring transparency and traceability. Tapping into Third-Generation Biofuel Potential in 2025 Among the next wave of feedstocks, algae is generating significant excitement as a potential game-changer for the green diesel market. Considered a third-generation feedstock, algae can be cultivated on non-arable land and can utilize wastewater or saltwater, minimizing competition for land and freshwater resources. Many species of microalgae are particularly promising due to their high lipid oil content, which can range from 20% to as high as 50% of their biomass, making them an ideal raw material for biofuel production. The global market for algae-based green diesel is already gaining traction, reflecting the growing investment in this area. However, scaling up production to commercial levels faces hurdles. Techno-economic analyses conducted in 2025, based on future productivity targets, indicate a high minimum fuel selling price, estimated at 2.2 €/L for fuels produced via lipid extraction and 3.4 €/L for those produced via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Overcoming these cost barriers through continued research and technological advances in cultivation, harvesting, and processing will be key to unlocking algae's full potential. Nations Leading the Green Diesel Charge A handful of nations are at the forefront of the green diesel market revolution, driven by ambitious climate policies and strategic investments. The United States currently leads the world in production capacity, with 22 operational renewable diesel plants as of January 2024 and a projected capacity of 5.1 billion gallons per year by the year's end. In Europe, which collectively accounts for a major share of the global market, countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands are notable leaders. Their progress is underpinned by strong policy frameworks, particularly the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates a greater share of renewables in transport. Finland is also a key player, home to the pioneering global producer Neste. To the north, Canada is making significant strides, highlighted by Imperial Oil's $507 million investment in a renewable diesel facility in Alberta, set to come online in 2025. Brazil is another nation showing increasing interest, with a focus on developing its capacity through the adoption of advanced hydrotreating technology to leverage its vast agricultural resources for fuel production. The Technological Vanguard, Innovations Driving Green Diesel Production Forward Technological advancement is the engine powering the scalability and cost-competitiveness of the green diesel market. The dominant production method is hydrotreating, also known as Hydroprocessed Vegetable Oil (HVO), a process where renewable feedstocks react with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. This technology creates a "drop-in" fuel that is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum diesel. Leading technology providers like Honeywell offer specialized solutions, such as their Ecofining™ process, which was adopted by Acelen Renewables in 2024 for a large-scale project. Following the core hydrotreating step, additional processes like hydrocracking and isomerization are often employed. Hydrocracking breaks down larger molecules to improve fuel efficiency, while isomerization rearranges molecular structures to enhance performance in cold weather. Beyond HVO, researchers and companies are developing other pathways, including catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), which shows great promise for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into refinable bio-oil, a key focus of research in 2024. Sealing the Deal: Key Distribution Pacts and Offtake Agreements of 2024 The growing acceptance of green diesel market is clearly reflected in the increasing number of significant distribution and offtake agreements announced in 2024. These deals are crucial for guaranteeing demand for producers and securing a stable supply of low-carbon fuel for end-users. In a landmark deal for the aviation sector announced in July 2024, Diamond Green Diesel committed to supplying an initial 1 million gallons of neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to World Fuel Services for use by JetBlue at New York's JFK Airport, with an option for 4 million additional gallons. In ground transport, Colonial Oil partnered with Neste in February 2024 to significantly boost the availability of renewable diesel in Savannah, Georgia, and the wider southeastern U.S. European aviation is also advancing, with low-cost carrier easyJet signing a memorandum of understanding with Spanish energy company Moeve in late 2024 for SAF supply on key Spanish routes from 2025 through 2030. Highlighting innovation, Zurich Airport Ltd. signed a pioneering offtake agreement in December 2024 with Synhelion to purchase 30,000 liters of solar-generated diesel annually starting in 2027 for use in its ground vehicle fleet. Customize the Data Scope to Match Your Objectives: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/green-diesel-market The Road Ahead: How 2025 Policies are Shaping Market Acceptance The trajectory of the green diesel market into 2025 and beyond is intrinsically linked to the strength and stability of government policies and corporate commitments. Regulatory frameworks like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have been instrumental in creating the initial demand and investment security for the industry. Similarly, in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has accelerated the adoption of green diesel by mandating its inclusion in the transport fuel mix. The growing demand is not purely policy-driven; corporations are increasingly adopting green diesel to meet their own sustainability targets and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, which see green diesel and SAF as one of the most viable, immediate pathways to decarbonization. As of 2025, the synergy between robust regulatory mandates, financial incentives from carbon markets, and a proactive corporate sector has created a fertile ground for the continued, rapid expansion of the green diesel market.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: D-Wave Quantum: Can QBTS Stock Deliver Another 1,000% Gain?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of D-Wave Quantum Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's stylized branding visible in the background, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) D-Wave Quantum stock (NYSE: QBTS) has witnessed immense growth, skyrocketing over 1,000% in the past twelve months due to increasing enthusiasm for quantum computing. Several factors influenced this remarkable performance: Additionally, if you seek a smoother investment than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Furthermore, take a look at – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified The quantum computing industry is transitioning from research and development to securing commercial applications. D-Wave’s quantum annealing technology is particularly effective for optimization challenges across various sectors including logistics, finance, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence. As these applications evolve from proof-of-concept to commercial usage, the potential for revenue could increase dramatically. The transition to cloud-based quantum computing services signifies a major revenue opportunity. D-Wave’s cloud-based quantum computing offerings position it to gain substantial market share in this swiftly expanding area, enabling customers to utilize quantum computing capabilities without significant capital expenditures. Related – What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Quantum computing has emerged as a national security priority, with governments worldwide making considerable investments in quantum research and development. D-Wave’s established technologies and collaborations position it to secure valuable long-term government contracts, providing consistent revenue streams and validation for commercial applications. For instance, D-Wave has successfully completed a significant defense-oriented installation through its partnership with Davidson Technologies. The physical setup of a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum system is finalized at Davidson’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama, marking the first annealing quantum computer to be hosted on-site in the state. NVIDIA serves as the most pertinent comparison for QBTS’s potential growth trajectory. Between 2016 and 2024, NVIDIA stock surged from around $8 to more than $130 (adjusted for splits), marking a 16x increase. This expansion occurred as NVIDIA evolved from a gaming graphics firm to a core component of AI infrastructure. Similarly, D-Wave may capitalize on the burgeoning quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to over $400 in 2020-2021, illustrating how groundbreaking applications can lead to explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly disrupt industries once they gain commercial traction. The company is subject to a variety of inherent risks. D-Wave Quantum is distinctively positioned to benefit from the shift of quantum computing from research to commercial implementation. The company’s technological dominance, first-mover advantage, and an expanding market create major opportunities for growth by tenfold over the next 3-5 years. The prevailing conditions, characterized by rising computational demands, considerable government spending, and the maturing of quantum applications, resemble the introductory phases of the internet or AI revolution. D-Wave’s established technology and commercial emphasis position it to capture disproportionate value as this evolution accelerates. Although significant risks remain, the chance for revolutionary impact across various industries warrants a premium valuation for investors with the suitable risk appetite and long-term investment perspectives. We underscore the considerable risk tied to this investment; therefore, investors should thoughtfully evaluate these risks or consider professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio with a selection of 30 stocks that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded greater returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Businesses support auto-enrolment, department says
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/16/businesses-support-auto-enrolment-department-says/
Time Published: 2025-07-16T14:51:03Z
Full Content:
The introduction of automatic pension enrolment in January will “undoubtedly” involve additional costs for businesses, but these will dissipate over time, the Department of Social Protection has said. Only about 35 per cent of private sector workers are currently in pension schemes, which means they would be dependent on the State pension when they retire. In many cases that would result in steep drops in living standards in retirement. To address this, anyone aged 23-60 and earning in excess of €20,000 a year will be automatically enrolled in the new scheme – called My Future Fund – on day one of their employment. It is expected that about 750,000 workers will be enrolled in this way. Under the terms of the scheme, employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross pay, increasing to 3 per cent after three years, to 4.5 per cent after a further three years, and finally to 6 per cent in year 10 and from then on. Contributions will be made equally by employees and employers with the State providing a top-up of €1 for every €3 saved by an employee. So, in short, every €3 saved by an employee will automatically become €7. Tim Duggan, assistant secretary general with the Department of Social Protection, was before the Oireachtas joint committee on social protection, rural and community development to answer questions on the scheme on Wednesday. While the scheme was broadly welcomed by the committee, a number of members raised concerns about the additional cost for businesses at a time when there is already significant pressure on margins. [ Auto-enrolment needs to be more user-friendly for bosses and workers, recruitment firm saysOpens in new window ] Mr Duggan acknowledged there would be a cost, but said the scheme had been designed to ease any pain. “Undoubtedly, this is an additional cost if you’re employing people,” he said. “However, it has been deliberately designed that instead of introducing the contribution at 6 per cent from the very beginning, it is phased in over a decade to allow employers to adjust budget-wise. “In most cases, and the experience of other counties has shown, that when you introduce it on a gradual basis like that, it becomes part of the normal remuneration negotiation that goes on between employers and employees on a continual basis.” [ Will starting a pension now exclude daughter from availing of auto-enrolment?Opens in new window ] He said there had been extensive talks with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec), the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association (Isme), and other business lobbies, and that “practically all of them” are “fully supportive” of the scheme. The scheme has been the subject of numerous delays as businesses have readied themselves for its introduction. Mr Duggan insisted it would “absolutely” be rolled out on January 1st without any further holdups. “We have made excellent progress in getting everything ready for the launch in January,” he said. Tata Consultancy Services, based in Letterkenny, Co Donegal, has been appointed as a managed service provider of the scheme’s administrative services and is currently configuring and testing its systems in line with the scheme’s requirements. Three investment managers – Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and Blackrock – have been selected for the scheme. Mr Duggan said the department is making “considerable progress” in staffing and resourcing the new authority, which will be called the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority or NAERSA. The recruitment of a chief executive and of board members are at a “final stage”, he said, while competitions are under way for the senior management positions. The scheme overall will create about 140 jobs in Letterkenny.

July 16, 2025 10:31 ET | Source: BAY Miner BAY Miner Miami, Florida, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobile-First Mining Platform Uses AI and Renewable Energy to Deliver Real-Time, Passive Crypto Income for Global Users In response to the crypto market’s latest bull run—fueled by Bitcoin crossing the $118,000 mark and Ethereum’s expanding institutional adoption—BAY Miner has officially introduced a next-generation mobile app that transforms smartphones into powerful cloud mining hubs.

Title: Aster Launches 24/7 Stock Perpetual Contracts Trading With Exposure to US Equities

Time Published: 2025-07-16T14:18:05Z
Full Content:
July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities.

July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone.

Title: UNI outlook as Uniswap president and COO steps down after four years

Uniswap Labs’ president and chief operating officer, Mary Catherine Lader, took it to X to confirm his departure after spending four years with the DeFi platform. Personal news: after four incredible years as President & COO of @Uniswap, I’m starting something new. This is a new chapter for crypto. We’ve come a long way since I started digital assets at BlackRock in 2015, and building with @haydenzadams was an awesome adventure. I’m… — Mary-Catherine Lader (@Mclader) July 15, 2025 While she remains as an advisor as the project prepares for a successor, attention has shifted to how Uniswap has fared since Lader joined in 2021. Lader leaves after four years of shaping Uniswap into a household name within the blockchain sector. Her departure means crucial transitions into the blockchain’s leadership and strategic direction. Lader joined the Uniswap team in 2021 after his role as BlackRock’s managing director. She was among the executives who left traditional finance to explore the cryptocurrency industry. The COO has monitored key operations, including Uniswap’s extension to several blockchains and the Uniswap mobile wallet launch. Also, Lader oversaw the termination of the Securities and Exchange Commission case. Most importantly, she was the president during the Uniswap v4 rollout. She helped transform Uniswap from a developer-centric project into a massive blockchain organization, overseeing internal developments across human resources, customer support, finance, and regulation. Thus, the Uniswap team will likely feel Larder’s absence as the COO. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has appreciated her leadership at Uniswap Labs, while some industry players urge Lader to join their projects. Congrats!! Appreciate your leadership at Uniswap over the years. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) July 16, 2025 Meanwhile, the transition signals a strategic decision not influenced by the network’s instability. While leadership changes aren’t uncommon in traditional companies as teams evolve, such shifts are somewhat rare in crypto, especially among early team members and founders. That’s why Mary’s departure attracted attention. However, she is leaving with excitement, which bodes well for Uniswap’s future as a DeFi giant. The development confirms a maturing industry. Early builders and founders can now move on with new challenges or launch new projects, similar to traditional setups. The blockchain’s total value locked has soared from $1.64 billion in December 2020 to $5.54 billion today. Also, the native coin UNI has performed relatively well. It has gained 12% on its yearly chart, showcasing resilience despite macro challenges. The platform boasts over $75 billion in monthly DEX volume, according to DeFiLlama. UNI trades at $9.04 after gaining 17% and 14% in the past month and week. Technical indicators highlight bullish presence. The 1D Moving Average Convergence Divergence displays green histograms above the signal line. Also, the daily chart’s Relative Strength Index at 65 suggests further gains before overbought conditions. Moreover, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed steadily since July 4. That confirms money entering the UNI ecosystem as investors anticipate substantial rallies. These signals match the prevailing broad market sentiments. Analysts forecast impending altcoin rallies as Bitcoin dominance cools after BTC’s latest rally to $123K.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Larry Ellison, Oracle Corp.’s ORCL co-founder and chairman, has once again overtaken Meta Platforms, Inc. META CEO Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's second-richest person. This is despite them both having $251 billion net worth. What Happened: According to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Ellison and Zuckerberg are tied at $251 billion, but because Ellison has gained $59 billion this year while the Meta CEO is up $43.4 billion, the Oracle co-founder might have placed above. This ranks him just after Tesla Inc. TSLA and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who remains the world's richest person at $358 billion. Others in the top five wealthiest individuals list are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos and former Microsoft Corporation MSFT CEO Steve Ballmer, with net worths of $247 billion and $174 billion, respectively. See Also: Nvidia Says ‘Washington Gets It’ After Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks Says US Has To ‘Outcompete’ Global Rivals Why It’s Important: Ellison's wealth, more than 80% of which is tied to Oracle stock and options, soared as Oracle shares climbed 47.27% in the last six months, reported Bloomberg. The rally followed news on Tuesday that the U.S. government would ease export restrictions, allowing chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD to resume selling some semiconductors to China. Oracle, which relies on high-end chips for its cloud and AI infrastructure, was among the top beneficiaries of the policy shift with a gain of 2.48% during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to Benzinga Pro. The company has also inked multibillion-dollar cloud deals and ramped up partnerships with firms including OpenAI and SoftBank Group SFTBF SFTBY as part of its Stargate initiative. Oracle's stock has also nearly tripled since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the report said. According to Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, Oracle is demonstrating strong positive momentum in the short, medium and long term. Additional performance insights are available here.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BEIJING, CHINA - JULY 15: Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp, ... More receives a media group interview before attending the welcome dinner of the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) on July 15, 2025 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Wan Quan/VCG via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has announced that it received confirmations from the Trump administration permitting it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after encountering a ban around April. This development comes just days after Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump. This decision represents a significant victory for Nvidia, which had been affected by stringent U.S. export controls designed to limit China’s access to advanced AI technology. The H20 chip, specifically created to adhere to U.S. regulations on chip exports, is less powerful than Nvidia’s leading products but has continued to be in high demand among Chinese clients. Separately, could oil help foster peace? See Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified. Nvidia recorded a $4.5 billion write-off in its most recent quarter due to unsold H20 chips that it could not reallocate to other markets. If sales of these high-volume chips to China resume, reversing some of this write-off could enhance earnings. Nvidia stock has been a strong performer this year, climbing nearly 18% to approximately $170 per share. Now, could easing U.S.-China tech tensions propel the next phase of Nvidia’s climb towards the $200 threshold? (related:What’s Happening With XRP Price?) China represents a vast and swiftly expanding AI market, hosting tech behemoths like Baidu and Alibaba, along with newcomers such as DeepSeek, that are increasingly competing with the U.S. in AI software development. Nevertheless, China still significantly lags in AI hardware, as domestic AI chips produced by companies like Huawei do not match the performance delivered by Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs. This establishes a profound dependence on Nvidia's technology to fulfill China’s AI aspirations. Simultaneously, China is an essential market for Nvidia. The nation generated $17 billion in revenue for the company in the fiscal year concluding in January 2025, which is roughly 13% of Nvidia’s total revenue. Moreover, this figure may not fully capture the breadth of the situation. Numerous Chinese tech firms have reportedly utilized gray market resellers and overseas intermediaries in nations like Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam to circumvent U.S. export restrictions and acquire Nvidia’s top-tier chips. These activities have led to governments enhancing enforcement measures and instigating crackdowns. Should the technology trade conflict ease, the recommencement of direct sales could substitute some of this shadow demand, offering Nvidia a clearer and more scalable growth trajectory in China. Nvidia is concentrating on balancing its response to this Chinese demand while adhering to U.S. regulations. The company additionally stated that it has created a new AI chip for China, aimed at applications in factory automation and logistics. This chip is based on Nvidia's most advanced Blackwell architecture but includes downgrades in certain features to address concerns raised by the U.S. government regarding the export of cutting-edge technology to China. While Nvidia stock has momentum in its favor, we consider that the stock may already be somewhat overvalued. We value Nvidia stock at approximately $130 per share, around 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more information. Certainly, Nvidia trades at about 40x forward earnings, which is justifiable considering that the company is set to increase revenues by 55% according to consensus estimates. However, there are some reasons to exercise caution. While Nvidia continues to be the benchmark for AI, the rally driven by "fear of missing out" that has propelled the stock over the past two years might start to lose momentum. Over the last three years, major technology companies have invested heavily in training increasingly larger AI models, significantly elevating the demand for Nvidia’s high-performance chips. Nonetheless, incremental performance improvements from larger AI models could begin to plateau, and the availability of high-quality training data may also present as a bottleneck. Additionally, the AI landscape may begin shifting from training to inference, where efficiency and cost become more significant than sheer power. In this transition, AMD’s MI series and open-source models might become more competitive. AMD’s ROCm software platform, although not as sophisticated as Nvidia’s CUDA, is expected to be sufficient for many inference tasks. This potential transition in AI workloads, combined with the risks associated with growth normalization, could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia’s most powerful and costly GPUs, potentially slowing the pace of its earnings growth in the future. Worried about the risks to NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; exhibiting less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Many more houses and apartments need to be built. Stock image: Getty The squeeze on home buyers has intensified after property prices shot up again in the year to May. It was the 21st month in a row of rising home values. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May, up from 7.6pc in the year to April, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc compared with May last year. The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to May 2025 was €370,000. This is up €5,000 on the median, or typical, price paid in April. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since May last year. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May 2025, 3,824 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time buyer purchases in May. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices an average of 10pc in the Mid-West, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the South-East, comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, saw a 7.7pc rise in house prices, the CSO said. This week the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

David Murphy Economics and Public Affairs Editor Irish residential property prices increased by 7.9% in the 12 months to May, marginally higher than the 7.6% rise in year up to April, according to latest figures from the Central Statistics Office. Prices rose faster outside the capital where they were up 8.7% while the cost of buying a home in Dublin was up 6.9%. The median price of buying a home in the 12 months to May was €370,000. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 in Blackrock in Dublin with a median price of €770,000, while F45 in Castlerea in Roscommon had the least expensive price of €150,000. "In the 12 months to May 2025, house prices in Dublin rose by 6.8% while apartment prices increased by 7.2%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 9.3% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 5.1%," the CSO said. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.9% and apartment prices rose by 6.7%. The CSO said the region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 11.1%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) recorded a 7.7% rise. Commenting on today's figures, Trevor Grant, the chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, noted that property prices continue to rise faster than incomes, pushing homeownership even further out of reach for many, especially first-time buyers who are now regularly competing with trader-uppers for an ever-shrinking pool of second-hand homes. He said that with supply still falling well short of demand, this imbalance is not likely to correct itself anytime soon. Mr Grant said that the median mortgage for a first-time buyer has surged by 36% since 2019 (according to BPFI data), now sitting just shy of €300,000. For buyers in high-cost areas, this number is even higher. "Despite that pressure, mortgage approvals have hit record highs. Buyer appetite remains strong, especially among first-time buyers," he said. "One in three first time buyer (FTB) homes were valued over €400,000 in 2024, three times the 2019 share. And it has recently been reported that average household incomes for new buyers sits at €85,000, so it's clear that affordability continues to be stretched, " he stated. He also said that while mortgage interest rates have eased in recent months, and some lenders are now offering sub-3% rates, affordability pressures remain severe. Properties are regularly selling well above asking price, with recent reports stating that one in six or seven now are going 20% over, he added. Mr Grant said the fundamental issue continues to be the chronic undersupply of housing - with just over 30,000 completions in 2024. "Yet we know we need at least 50,000 new homes per year for the next five years to meet demand," he said. He said the shortage of private supply is particularly acute, and developers are still facing major challenges, including rising build costs, planning bottlenecks, and labour shortages. "Delays in connecting new homes to essential utilities like water and electricity are also adding to delivery timelines and further restricting the pace of supply. Without targeted intervention to boost output and streamline the development process, house price inflation will persist," he added.

Title: What ‘Crypto Week’ Means for ETFs

The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com It’s “Crypto Week,” and that means clients are probably wondering if they should transfer their retirement savings to meme coins. Congress is preparing to vote on three landmark bills this week that could transform America into the world capital of crypto. The Genius Act, which allows private companies to launch stable coins, already passed the Senate. But, the other two proposals — the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which sets up a framework for crypto to be regulated as a security or commodity; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act that bans the Fed from launching a digital currency — may have a more difficult path to President Trump’s desk. The bills could revolutionize how digital assets are bought, sold and regulated in the US. But with all the attention, what will it take for advisors to finally get on board with an asset class that is quickly becoming impossible to ignore? “We think about crypto investments often, but before incorporating them, we want to understand what problem it solves,” said Robert Persichitte of Delagify Financial. It’s no surprise that the price of Bitcoin topped a record $123,000 high on Monday and that’s been good news for issuers and investors. The world’s biggest Bitcoin ETF reaped the benefits this week with the $80 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) jumping 2.5% as Bitcoin broke pricing records. Other funds also cashed in, including: There may be an even bigger rush to digital assets once more sovereign governments issue debts denominated in cryptocurrency, like El Salvador, Persichitte said. “That’s when it emerges as a unified, globally unified, currency, but it will be difficult to see when that is coming in the future.” Where’s the Bill? While many clients are already invested in crypto, the “eye-popping” valuation could encourage more client questions about digital assets, said Lawrence K. Pon, a CFP and CPA at Pon & Associates. Besides risk, however, there are other important aspects of crypto that advisors should be aware of, like understanding the tax consequences. Trades will generate capital gains or losses that need to be reported on Form 8949, Pon said. Clients will also need to think about estate planning. “Can their beneficiaries get to the cryptocurrency after they die?” Pon said. “They need to understand all the complications before investing.” JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The first spot Solana ETF came to market last week through a filing under the Securities Act of 1940, unlike competitors who filed under the 1933 Act. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The first half of the year has been all about actives. Now, investors have the numbers to prove it. Active ETF launches and inflows hit record highs in the first half of the year, according to a recent Morningstar report. Increasingly complex strategies — like derivative income and collateralized loan obligation funds — are becoming more popular amid ongoing market turbulence, and continue to eat away at mutual fund market share. Active fixed-income ETFs were also favored by investors. “We’ve seen a lot of interest in active bond ETFs, particularly from big managers like Vanguard, [who] make it very clear that they plan to compete actively in the active bond space,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA. “So we expect a lot more growth there.” There have also been 297 active ETF launches so far this year, with firms like Capital Group, JPMorgan, and T. Rowe Price continuing to build out offerings. Active strategies collectively took in $183 billion in assets, per the report, with derivative income, large blend, and ultrashort bond strategies seeing the most inflows. There was also a jump in the number of ETFs with small- and mid-cap holdings, a trend to look out for, said Stephen Welch, research analyst at Morningstar and author of the report. “That’s obviously a place where capacity matters, so it’d be interesting if there’s uptake there, and if firms continue to launch in that area,” he said. The top-performing funds of H1 2025 in terms of net flows were: The large-blend, ultrashort bond, derivative-income, and large-value categories accounted for roughly half of all active ETF flows so far this year. Still, buffer ETFs, a recent addition to the space, accounted for more than 100 active fund launches in the past six months. Call of Duty. Covered call strategies are another major category to keep an eye on, said Ullal, exemplified by the popularity — especially among older investors nearing retirement — of products like JPMorgan’s JEPQ. “If you look at those strategies, they tend to underperform in a very rapidly rising market, if you’re writing call options on equities,” he said. “But in a market that’s declining or going sideways, it’s an effective strategy to generate income.” The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation.

A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Much of Wall Street is expecting a possible market slowdown in the second half of the year, so it’s a good thing it hit some high notes beforehand. It’s earnings season, which is often a time to celebrate victories, and BlackRock hit a big one. The New York-based firm reported Tuesday that its assets under management grew to a record $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, up 18% year over year, putting it in a league of its own. Still, shares slid more than 5% on Tuesday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink attributing the move to investor concerns over the company’s expenses. Meanwhile, Boston-based competitor State Street reported $5.1 trillion in AUM as well as $49 trillion in assets under custody, a 17% and 11% increase year over year, respectively. Basically, two of the world’s largest asset managers just got a lot bigger. The firm’s success in the first half of the year has been driven by high stock prices, massive inflows, and BlackRock’s push into private markets: Also, on the private market front, BlackRock completed its acquisition of private credit firm HPS Investment Partners this month and agreed to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate-focused private-equity firm. Starting next year, BlackRock plans to expand access to alternatives by including private assets in target-date retirement funds. “This is a place that we have particular strength and can add a lot of value, rather than just rote allocations of X percent to public markets and Y percent to private markets,” Martin Small, BlackRock CFO, said on an earnings call Tuesday. Win Some, Lose Some. State Street’s low-cost offerings were a win this quarter as many investors sought out affordable ETFs over mutual funds. The company generated nearly $3.5 billion in revenue this past quarter, bolstered by an 11% jump in fees year over year. However, despite higher revenue, profits fell as total expenses reached $2.5 billion in the second quarter, also up 11% compared with this time last year. State Street’s expenses went toward workforce reorganization, technology upgrades and higher performance-based incentives. Like they say, you gotta spend money to make money. – Griffin Kelly The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation.

Title: Law judge calls for Minnesota PUC to reject $6.2B Allete private equity deal

Let Utility Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In partnership with In partnership with The pending deal poses risks to Allete’s financial health and ratepayers, and the proposed private equity model isn’t in the public interest, an administrative law judge said. The proposed Allete transaction, announced in May 2024, has cleared all required regulatory hurdles, except for approval by the Minnesota PUC. However, ALJ McKenzie agreed with entities opposing the deal — the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General, a consortium of Minnesota Power’s large industrial customers, the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, the Sierra Club and CURE, an advocacy group — that it doesn’t meet Minnesota’s public interest standard. Allete and its buyers failed to adequately support key arguments for completing the deal, such as improving the utility company’s access to capital and expertise, according to McKenzie. “Petitioners have not shown that the acquisition will improve Allete’s access to capital or even whether Allete needs improved access,” McKenzie said. Also, access to CPP Investments’ and GIP’s expertise appears to have limited value because of assurances that they intend to keep Allete’s existing management, staff and business plan, she said. Further, the private equity model offered by CPP Investments and GIP isn’t in the public interest, McKenzie said, pointing to the experience of Upper Peninsula Power Co., a utility in Michigan with similarities to Minnesota Power that was bought by private equity firms in 2014 and 2021. After a series of post-transaction rate increases, UPPCO’s rates were 9 cents/kWh higher than the average rate for other investor-owned utilities in Michigan at the end of last year, according to McKenzie. In her recommended decision, McKenzie cited Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie’s warnings that asset managers such as Blackrock could hurt ratepayers by trying to maximize profits from the utilities they buy. “Consistent with the strategies of private equity investors generally, the partners plan to become deeply involved in Allete’s governance,” McKenzie said. CPP Investments and GIP expect to earn a return by buying Allete that “significantly exceeds” the returns produced by publicly traded utilities, according to McKenzie. “Petitioners are most likely to make up the difference between a plausible regulated return and the targeted return through financial engineering,” she said. After the deal was announced, S&P Global Ratings lowered Allete’s outlook to “negative” from “stable” over concerns the transaction could lead to higher leverage and weaker financial measures at the company, McKenzie noted. Under private owners, Allete will no longer be required to make financial filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly reduce information available to the Minnesota PUC and ratepayers about the company, according to McKenzie. Despite the ALJ recommended decision, Allete expects the Minnesota PUC will approve the transaction this year, noting it is supported by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 31, the Laborers' International Union of Minnesota & North Dakota and other organizations. Under the agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power would freeze its base rates for a year and reduce its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65% until a future rate case, providing immediate ratepayer benefits, according to Allete. Also, CPP Investments and GIP agreed to fund Allete’s five-year capital plan, ensuring that the company will have access to the capital needed to advance its transmission and renewable energy goals, Allete said. Besides its utility subsidiaries, Allete owns Allete Clean Energy, a renewable energy company, BNI Energy, a coal company, and New Energy Equity, a solar developer. It has an 8% stake in American Transmission Co.

Title: Two weeks of showtime in Parliament, the new Plevris law, Euronext advances on the Hellenic Exchange, a (faint) light in Santorini, no deal for AVAX

-Greetings, the last parliamentary fortnight of July will be anything but relaxed, and it will likely mark the lead-up to the brief summer recess of Parliament. I say this because in the next two weeks, three separate critical votes are scheduled, each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster, and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources, this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday, July 21–23. On July 24, we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave, obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month, we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE, followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this, of course, assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank. The “green” official on the radar The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration law The M.M. and the Virgin of Petra Santorini Pierrakakis–Hardalias Euronext proceeds with HELEX – The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway, with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%, trading 305,000 shares at €7.25, leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August, and certainly no later than September. See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement – The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans, as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked, and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate, which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements, it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports. Ioannou on the rumors of a deal – Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market, when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX, he stated that a merger is not in the cards, expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers,” he remarked, addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues, with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years, not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders, this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond, without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan, not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply, if a “good offer” comes along, they won’t be caught off guard. Loukianou, Charagionis, and… the parking lot – The newly formed company “Continental Garage,” whose main activity is parking services, seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent, nearly tragic, incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill, demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear, but if it does, it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis, son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975, currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus, totaling 2,500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage, its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis, Sokratis Vertelis, Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou, and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales, organizing car and motorcycle rallies, and a host of other ventures. OTE stops burning money in Romania – OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday, both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3, while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO, he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July, and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However, an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil, Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone, OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter. Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI – On June 25, the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90,000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously, the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms, budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million. Uptick with volume and lots of blocks – On the bright side, the market returned to positive territory, with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside, there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1,960.9 points (+0.38%), with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268, Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16, and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1, climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%), followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60. The three stocks that stood out – As mentioned above, the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25, peaking at €7.35 during the session, while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers, Euronext is offering €400 million, while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million, making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high, with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump, the stock crossed €4.40, levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains, up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10, when the report was published, the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile, a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings, which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90, a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850,000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308,000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share. Record year with 15 Strategic Investments – At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments, chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos, not only were four major projects approved, but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15, 2025, a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved, with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these, 12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered, with more to come, according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months, 7 are industrial investments worth €990 million, 2 involve research and technology (€136 million), and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion. Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy – Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers, creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany, Ohio, while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile, a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages, raising serious concerns. Now, everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts. Explore related questions

Title: A millennial made $300,000 secretly working multiple jobs — while tasked with catching others doing the same

Full Content:
Eric was paid to catch employees secretly working multiple jobs. Then he became one of them. A few years ago, Eric was working in an IT role at a large company. His job responsibilities included investigating three types of "illicit employment" within the organization: workers who outsourced their job responsibilities to overseas contractors, foreign actors who infiltrated companies by posing as legitimate hires, and employees secretly juggling multiple jobs without the company's approval. But there wasn't much suspicious activity to investigate, Eric said, and he was working as little as one hour each day. Then he had an idea: What if he took on a second job to boost his income? While Eric considered it, he initially held back because he was worried about getting caught. But that changed the following year, when his employer asked him to focus more on detecting job jugglers, and he realized just how difficult they were to identify. After weighing the risks, Eric applied for and landed a remote role, bringing his combined annual income to roughly $300,000. He said he worked only a couple of hours a day across the jobs. In addition to the financial benefits, Eric said he took the second job to gain an inside look at the "overemployed" world, one that might help him identify job jugglers. He said the firsthand experience helped him catch several employees who were ultimately fired. But this success came with a growing problem for Eric, one that ultimately cut his job-juggling journey short. He feared the very system he was building to catch others would end up catching him, and jeopardize his career. "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder," said Eric, whose identity, employment, and income were verified by Business Insider, but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing fears of professional repercussions. "It was a wild time in my life." Eric, a millennial in the US, is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple jobs to increase their incomes. Over the past three years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra cash to travel the world, buy expensive weight-loss drugs, and pay down student debt. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. Additionally, tech layoffs and return-to-office mandates have created obstacles for current and aspiring job jugglers. But many overemployed workers have told BI that the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Eric never planned for his job juggling to last forever. While his initial concerns about getting caught eased enough for him to accept the second role, he still worried that he'd eventually be exposed. "I thought I could make some money real quick and get out," he said. But Eric feared that if his savings started ballooning because of his two incomes, he'd get "emotionally attached" to the extra earnings, making it harder to walk away. His solution was to spend freely on things he'd normally avoid. He said he viewed job juggling like renting a luxurious car: fun while it lasts, but not something you do forever. "I was ordering stuff off Amazon all the time," he said. "It was like expendable income." In addition to unlocking this spending spree, working multiple jobs gave Eric firsthand insight into how people with multiple roles operated — knowledge that helped him sharpen his detection skills and catch job jugglers. "It really wasn't until after I had my second job that I started getting actionable outcomes from my investigations because I just knew exactly what to look for," he said. Eric said he used internal company activity data to look for behavioral patterns that could suggest someone was juggling multiple jobs, such as sudden swings in productivity during specific parts of the day. Some workers were highly active in the morning and quiet all afternoon, or vice versa. His thinking, based partly on his personal experience, was that job jugglers would split time between their two roles. "I'd go back historically and see that at one point they were working all day and now they're not," he said. "So it just came down to behaviors." When an employee's activity seemed suspicious, Eric said, he'd contact their manager and ask how often the worker appeared on camera during meetings, whether they'd missed any lately, and whether their work quality had declined over time. If concerns persisted, he'd suggest the manager schedule a one-on-one video call during the worker's usual inactive hours. If the employee repeatedly asked to delay or reschedule the call, that would raise red flags, and the case could eventually be handed off to HR. Even as Eric's detection capabilities improved, he wasn't too concerned about his own work behaviors being flagged, he said. But that changed when he discovered that a security software program used by both of his employers could detect when multiple devices were running the software on the same home network — an indicator someone could be juggling multiple jobs. While he wasn't certain it would expose him, the realization made him nervous. At the same time, he was having mixed feelings about the ethics of overemployment. So, after less than a year of working two jobs, Eric decided to drop one of his roles. "As I went further and further along, I realized I couldn't keep this up because I was building detections that were going to catch me," he said. While overemployment has become more common because of the rise of remote work, Eric said he doesn't think most companies are particularly concerned about it. His detection work occasionally comes up during job interviews, and from what he's gathered, employers generally believe job jugglers will either drop a job after burning out or reaching a financial goal, or be let go for underperformance. If catching overemployed workers isn't a big priority for most companies, many job jugglers may be able to avoid detection, at least in the short term. Eric said that looking back, he sometimes wonders whether he could have kept going a little longer. "I just felt like I was going to get caught, and I didn't want to lose my entire career, so I had to stop," he said. "But man, I kind of regret it sometimes. It was really good money." Jump to

Title: ‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/you-cant-put-the-genie-back-bitwise-cio-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-07-16T06:30:10Z

The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight. In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto. According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream.

A stylized representation of Bitcoin’s decentralized network. Bitcoin operates without central control, enabling financial freedom through peer-to-peer transactions. Bitcoin isn’t just an investment or a buzzword – it’s a beacon of hope and freedom in a world facing unprecedented economic and social challenges. Around the globe, people are confronting rising inflation, inequitable access to banking, costly remittances, and authoritarian financial controls. In this context, Bitcoin emerges as more than a technology; it is a movement empowering individuals with financial sovereignty. The following sections explore how, right now, Bitcoin is catalyzing economic inclusion, safeguarding value against inflation, streamlining global payments, empowering the oppressed, and spurring a revolution in decentralized innovation. The message is clear and urgent: the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever. 1. Economic Freedom and Financial Inclusion: Banking the Unbanked Billions of people worldwide remain unbanked or underbanked, locked out of traditional finance . This lack of access means missed opportunities and vulnerability to exploitation. Bitcoin offers a lifeline of economic freedom. With nothing more than a smartphone and internet, anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet and join the global economy . There are no gatekeepers demanding paperwork or minimum balances – Bitcoin’s network is open to all. In places where banking infrastructure is weak, Bitcoin is filling the gap. Nigeria is a powerful example. Despite over 55% of Nigerians lacking bank accounts, the country ranks second worldwide in crypto adoption . An astonishing 47% of Nigerians aged 18–64 have used cryptocurrency, the highest rate globally . Young entrepreneurs in Lagos or Kano aren’t waiting for banks – they’re using Bitcoin to start businesses, pay bills, and store savings in a way that was impossible before. Even a government ban couldn’t stem this tide; peer-to-peer Bitcoin trade flourished until the ban was lifted in late 2023 . This grassroots movement shows Bitcoin’s inclusive power: it is simply the most efficient way for many Nigerians to conduct daily transactions, from buying groceries to paying for phone credit . We see a similar story in El Salvador, where about 70% of the population was unbanked prior to 2021 . By making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador enabled millions of citizens to leapfrog into digital finance via mobile wallets. Suddenly, a single mother in a rural village – previously without any bank access – can receive payments or remittances on her phone and participate in the economy. The motivation was clear: “help the 70% of Salvadorans who are unbanked” by allowing anyone with a phone to transact . This bold step has turned El Salvador into a living laboratory for financial inclusion, inspiring other countries to explore Bitcoin for the same reason. Bitcoin is economic empowerment. It democratizes finance, giving individuals control over their money regardless of status or location. From subsistence farmers in Africa to gig workers in Southeast Asia, people are downloading wallets and unlocking opportunities. They can save without fear of local bank failures, transact across borders, and access global markets directly. As the World Economic Forum noted, cryptocurrencies are building “open, democratic financial systems” that can include the 1.7 billion+ underbanked people through low-cost, automated services . In short, Bitcoin is banking the unbanked, igniting hope in communities long left on the margins. The world urgently needs this inclusive financial revolution to continue growing. 2. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Times Around the world, families are watching their hard-earned savings melt away as inflation soars. In these trying times, Bitcoin shines as digital gold – a safe haven asset with a hard cap that governments cannot debase . Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million coins. This built-in scarcity makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and instills confidence that one’s savings won’t be eroded by central bank policies . As a result, more people are turning to Bitcoin as a store of value when traditional money falters. We see this vividly in countries suffering hyperinflation or currency collapse. In Venezuela, years of economic mismanagement led to one of history’s worst hyperinflations at over 1,000,000% . The Venezuelan bolívar became virtually worthless – but Bitcoin offered a lifeline. Venezuelans began converting their rapidly devaluing cash into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to preserve whatever value they could. By 2020, Venezuela ranked third globally on the crypto adoption index due to the sheer volume of bolívar-to-Bitcoin transactions . Everyday people used Bitcoin to protect wages from inflation, with bank deposits losing value “in weeks or even days” otherwise . As Reuters reported, in Venezuela “crypto has become a tool to send remittances, protect wages from inflation and help businesses manage cash flow in a depreciating currency” . In short, Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for many Venezuelans, acting as a palliative for economic disaster when nothing else was available. Argentina provides another compelling case. Long plagued by inflation, Argentina recently saw annual inflation spike above 100%, the highest in decades. In response, Argentinians have rushed into cryptocurrency as a hedge. By mid-2023 an estimated 5 million Argentines (over 10% of the population) were using crypto regularly . Data shows that as the Argentinian peso plunged, crypto purchases shot up, peaking when inflation crossed 100% for the first time in thirty years . Many people now take their paycheck and immediately convert it to Bitcoin or stablecoins to escape the peso’s loss in value . One local exchange executive explained, “We have really high inflation… That makes crypto a valuable option for saving” . For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers something their national currency cannot: trustworthy long-term value. It’s telling that even in a bear market for crypto, Argentina led Latin America in transaction volume precisely because of this need to survive hyperinflation . What makes Bitcoin so attractive in these scenarios is financial sovereignty. As Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein observed, if you hold Bitcoin in your own wallet, “governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you” . People living under double- or triple-digit inflation have discovered this truth firsthand. Bitcoin’s design guarantees that no central authority can erode its value by printing more. This provides an essential hedge, especially during hyperinflationary spirals when prices double in weeks and local currencies collapse. Even in more stable economies, the post-2020 era of stimulus and rising prices has woken people up: in the U.S. and Europe, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as “digital gold” to diversify portfolios and guard against the highest inflation in 40 years. Historical data show that interest in Bitcoin spikes during inflationary periods , reflecting its growing reputation as “a hedge against traditional market downturns” . By offering ordinary people a way to preserve wealth, Bitcoin is fulfilling one of its most important promises. Whether it’s a middle-class family in Turkey watching the lira crash, or a professional in Lebanon who saw banks freeze their accounts (and wished they’d held Bitcoin ), individuals are learning that Bitcoin can secure their financial future when local systems fail. In a very real sense, Bitcoin is hope: hope that one’s lifetime of savings can be saved from the silent theft of inflation. As more people recognize this, Bitcoin’s role as the 21st century store-of-value will only grow – a stabilizing force in an unstable world . 3. Cross-Border Payments and Remittances: Fast, Low-Cost Global Transfers Every year, migrant workers and families worldwide lose billions of dollars to high fees and slow processes when sending money across borders. Traditional remittance services often charge 5-10% per transaction and can take days to clear . For the people relying on these funds – often small amounts for food, education or medicine – those fees hurt the most. Bitcoin offers a game-changing alternative: near-instant, low-cost international transfers that can empower families and boost entire economies. Consider El Salvador again. Remittances from workers abroad make up a whopping 20% of El Salvador’s GDP , but much of that used to be skimmed off by money transmitters. By embracing Bitcoin, El Salvador aimed to dramatically cut remittance costs for its people. Using the government’s Chivo wallet or Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, Salvadorans can now receive money from the U.S. in seconds, with virtually no fees – a stark contrast to lining up at Western Union and paying hefty commissions . This means more money in the pockets of low-income families and rural communities. As President Bukele touted, a construction worker in California can send $100 back home and nearly the whole $100 arrives, rather than $85 after fees. Enabling direct Bitcoin remittances has been life-changing for households that depend on that extra cash for daily needs. It also exemplifies how Bitcoin makes global commerce more fair: it doesn’t discriminate between a bank transfer of $10 or $10,000, and it never takes a cut based on percentage. Across the globe, other countries are similarly leveraging Bitcoin and crypto for remittances. Mexico, one of the world’s largest remittance destinations, has seen a surge in crypto-fueled transfers. In 2022, the exchange Bitso processed over $3.3 billion in remittances from the US to Mexico via crypto, about 5.4% of total flows . That 5% share – achieved in just a few years – translated into millions of dollars saved in fees for Mexican families. Importantly, these Bitcoin-based remittances arrive in minutes rather than days, and receivers in Mexico’s villages can convert to pesos or keep Bitcoin as they choose. The convenience and speed are a game changer. It’s no wonder that other Latin American countries with large U.S. diasporas (like Guatemala or Honduras) are exploring similar avenues, and companies like Strike are building Bitcoin Lightning solutions specifically to link U.S. earners with families back home in the developing world. In Africa, where remittance fees are the highest in the world, Bitcoin and stablecoins are truly transformative. Many Africans working abroad have shifted to sending money home via crypto because it can be 40-60% cheaper than using a traditional remittance corridor . For example, sending $200 in the legacy system might cost $20 or more in some African routes, whereas doing it with Bitcoin or a dollar-pegged crypto costs just a few dollars – and arrives the same day. Startups have sprouted across Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana to facilitate these transfers, often using Bitcoin’s network as the backbone beneath user-friendly apps. The result is that families can receive more of what their loved ones earn, helping pay for schooling, healthcare, and local business investments. But remittances are only part of the story. Cross-border commerce and payments are also being revolutionized by Bitcoin’s network. Small exporters and freelancers in countries with restrictive banking can now get paid directly in Bitcoin from international clients, sidestepping delays of wire transfers or unfair currency exchange rates. A designer in Lagos or a coder in Dhaka can offer their services globally and receive value in minutes, opening up opportunities previously blocked by banking friction. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a secondary layer for instant micropayments, has further enabled things like pay-as-you-go services, streaming money for content, and tipping creators across borders with negligible fees. These innovations point to a future where sending money is as easy as sending an email – a future Bitcoin is actively creating today. The world urgently needs faster, fairer payments, and Bitcoin is delivering. By stripping away the artificial barriers and tolls in the legacy system, Bitcoin lets migrants support their families more effectively and lets value flow to where it’s needed most. It’s profoundly inspiring to see a grandmother in the Philippines receive a Lightning payment on her phone from her grandson overseas, or a community in Senegal fund a well via global Bitcoin donations, all with minimal overhead. This is financial connectivity as it should be: inclusive, efficient, and empowering. As more people discover how easily and cheaply they can transact globally with Bitcoin, the pressure will mount on old remittance providers to lower costs – a positive force Bitcoin has already set in motion. 4. Political and Social Empowerment: Sovereignty Under Authoritarian Regimes Imagine living under a regime that controls every aspect of your life – even your ability to access money. In many authoritarian and crisis-hit countries, people face financial repression: frozen bank accounts, capital controls, surveillance of transactions, and the ever-present threat of asset seizure. Here, Bitcoin’s value is not just financial – it’s profoundly human. Bitcoin provides a form of money that no dictator can easily control, giving dissidents, activists, and ordinary citizens a tool to reclaim their freedom. As one activist put it, “Bitcoin is bad for dictators”, because it’s money that empowers the people . Time and again, when repressive governments have tried to cut off their citizens from resources, Bitcoin has ridden to the rescue. In Nigeria, during the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, authorities froze the bank accounts of activists to stifle the movement . But young protesters quickly turned to Bitcoin for fundraising after seeing their local currency access blocked. Within days, Bitcoin donations from around the world were keeping the protests alive, paying for food, medical supplies and legal aid – all beyond the government’s reach. Nigeria’s youth effectively said: “If the banks won’t let us raise money for justice, we’ll use Bitcoin, which no one can censor.” This marked one of the first major instances where a social movement was funded by cryptocurrency out of necessity, showcasing Bitcoin’s power as censorship-resistant money. Even as the government tried to clamp down (at one point even ordering crypto accounts frozen), organizers kept routing funds through Bitcoin until their voices were heard. In Belarus and Russia, opposition groups and journalists have similarly leaned on Bitcoin to survive crackdowns. When authoritarian regimes blacklist dissident organizations from financial services, they assume they can starve them out. But with Bitcoin, an independent media outlet or an NGO can keep operating, paying contributors and receiving support from abroad, without a single bank having to approve. Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation notes that “so many people…have essentially been saved or rescued because of this technology” . His organization started recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as early as 2013, when Ukrainian protesters in Kyiv faced bank freezes and found that Bitcoin could still get funds to them on the ground . In his words, “Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful tool against authoritarian control”, offering ordinary people an alternative when regimes would otherwise trap or devalue their money . No story illustrates this better than that of Venezuela’s medical workers in 2020. Amidst economic collapse and COVID-19, Venezuela’s authoritarian government was blocking aid money for doctors and nurses – refusing assistance for political reasons while these frontline workers earned just a few dollars a month. The opposition-led team found a clever solution: they used cryptocurrency to bypass the regime and deliver aid directly. They set up Bitcoin (and stablecoin) wallets for thousands of healthcare workers. Funds from international donors were sent to these wallets, and trusted community members (termed “human ATMs”) helped the recipients convert to usable local currency . This Bitcoin-fueled aid program succeeded in getting $100 per month to 65,000 desperate doctors and nurses – an absolute lifeline when the average salary had plunged to just $5 . The government could neither intercept nor stop this relief, as it was happening on a decentralized network outside their control. Think about that: tens of thousands of families were sustained because Bitcoin enabled humanitarian aid without borders. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s potential as a weapon against oppression, delivering hope where conventional channels failed. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and self-custody mean that you and you alone control your money. If you hold your own Bitcoin keys, no bank, no court, not even a superpower can freeze your account or block a transaction. For people in Hong Kong, Iran, Afghanistan, and other repressive environments, this is incredibly empowering. It means a journalist can escape their country with their savings intact on a USB drive or memorized seed phrase – whereas carrying cash or gold would get confiscated at the border. It means a refugee can receive support directly from supporters worldwide, even if the local regime wants to choke them off. And it means communities can build a degree of economic autonomy, using Bitcoin in local circular economies, that lets them endure sanctions or financial blockades. As Gladstein has bluntly stated, Bitcoin strips authoritarians of a key lever of control. “With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to [financially] manipulate and control people is completely decimated,” he explains . A government can’t inflate away your wealth if it’s in Bitcoin, and they can’t freeze what they can’t find the keys to. Indeed, “no government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it”, as one Lebanese survivor of hyperinflation observed – and that could have saved many in his country’s collapse . This is why Bitcoin is increasingly called “freedom money”. It is giving people an exit door from tyrannical systems. Each time an oppressed individual opts out of the state-controlled currency, they reclaim a bit of power over their own life. We should be clear: Bitcoin alone won’t topple dictators overnight. But it evens the playing field by denying dictators total financial dominance. It provides a plan B for those bravely working for change – a way to sustain themselves and their missions when traditional means are cut off. This has a profound psychological impact too: just knowing there is an alternative builds resilience. In the words of one Togolese activist, people in autocracies turn to Bitcoin because “it helps bypass financial repression” and gives them hope for a more free future . By empowering civil society and weakening the grip of repressive governments over finances, Bitcoin is quietly fueling a revolution in human rights. The world needs this “money of freedom” today, because so many are still fighting for their basic dignity under harsh regimes. Bitcoin is their ally – our ally – in the timeless struggle for liberty. 5. Technological Innovation and Decentralization: A New Era of Trust and Opportunity Bitcoin isn’t just changing finance; Bitcoin is changing the world by introducing a revolutionary model of trust through technology. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network in 2009, few understood that this was the dawn of a new era – the era of decentralized innovation. Today, we recognize Bitcoin as the foundation of a global shift: a shift towards systems that are open, transparent, and not reliant on any single authority. This technological paradigm is unleashing creativity and economic opportunity on a scale reminiscent of the early internet. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin sparked the Fourth Industrial Revolution in finance, one centered on decentralization and digital scarcity. At its core, Bitcoin solved a problem long thought impossible: it created digital scarcity. For the first time, there was a digital asset that could not be copied endlessly, that people could trust to hold value like a physical commodity. This breakthrough – “the birth of digital scarcity” – underpins Bitcoin’s value . With a hard limit of 21 million coins, Bitcoin established a reliable, programmatic monetary policy that anyone in the world can verify. This scarcity, combined with robust security, means Bitcoin can serve as a foundation for wealth creation and preservation in the digital age . It has inspired an entire ecosystem of innovation: thousands of cryptocurrencies, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and more – all tracing their lineage back to Bitcoin’s fundamental breakthroughs. Yet Bitcoin remains unique and irreplaceable, the most secure and widely adopted of them all . As an OSL research piece put it, Bitcoin’s “unique properties, such as scarcity, decentralization, and security, contribute to its status as a digital asset that cannot be replicated.” Decentralization is the beating heart of Bitcoin’s technology. By operating on a global network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners, Bitcoin eliminates the need for any middleman or central server . Transactions are verified by the consensus of the network participants, not by trusting a bank or government. This has enormous implications. It means the Bitcoin network is extraordinarily resilient – there’s no single point of failure that could bring it down . It means transparency – every transaction is recorded on an open ledger (the blockchain) that anyone can examine, reducing the chance of fraud. And it means empowerment – “it empowers individuals by giving them control over their own funds,” free from the fees and whims of intermediaries . In practical terms, a farmer in India can trade with a developer in France and a designer in Brazil directly, with each party trusting the math and the network, not having to know or trust each other beforehand. This trustless transaction capability is revolutionary; it removes friction and fosters a new era of global commerce and collaboration. Bitcoin’s decentralized design also drives security and immutability. The network is secured by advanced cryptography and a proof-of-work mechanism that makes altering confirmed transactions virtually impossible . Unlike centralized databases that hackers often breach, Bitcoin’s blockchain has never been compromised in its history. Once a transaction is settled in a block, it cannot be changed or erased . This gives users an unprecedented level of confidence in the integrity of their money. Funds can’t just vanish because of a bank’s error or a government’s whim – the Bitcoin ledger is ironclad. Each additional participant and each additional use case only strengthens the network (through what’s known as the network effect): as more people use Bitcoin, it becomes more valuable and useful, which attracts yet more users in a virtuous cycle . Already Bitcoin has the largest, most battle-tested computing network on Earth securing it, making it one of the most secure assets ever devised. This level of security is what allows Bitcoin to function as digital cash and digital gold simultaneously. And as the network grows, we see more businesses and even nations exploring it, knowing that they can plug into a financial protocol that is robust and globally accessible. Beyond Bitcoin itself, the innovations spurred by Bitcoin’s principles are reshaping technology and finance. The rise of the Lightning Network, for instance, has made Bitcoin payments ultra-fast and scalable, enabling a wave of creativity in micropayments and small-value use cases. In 2025, the Lightning Network reached new heights, reportedly processing over 100 million transactions in a single quarter as adoption accelerated . This layer-2 solution allows people to send tiny fractions of a cent instantly – something not feasible with traditional payment rails – which is opening up possibilities like pay-per-stream content, micro-tipping for social media posts, and machine-to-machine payments in the Internet of Things. As Lightning and similar technologies mature, Bitcoin is evolving from just a store of value to a full-fledged payments and innovation platform. Crucially, Bitcoin has catalyzed a movement towards decentralized governance and open-source development in finance. It proved that a community of globally distributed contributors can maintain and upgrade a monetary system without any CEO or central authority. This is inspiring new governance models in other domains (think decentralized autonomous organizations for everything from art to insurance). In essence, Bitcoin taught the world that trust can be built into code – and that people anywhere can cooperate to run critical infrastructure (like money) by consensus. The cultural impact of this cannot be overstated: “Bitcoin serves as a symbol of resistance against centralized control and government overreach”, representing a vision of a future where financial freedom and sovereignty are accessible to all . It has ignited the imagination of millions – engineers, economists, futurists – who are now pushing the boundaries of what decentralized tech can do, from reinventing banking to creating new social networks free of censorship. The world needs Bitcoin’s innovative spirit urgently. Traditional financial systems, with their siloed ledgers and 20th-century technology, struggle to keep pace with today’s digital economy. Bitcoin and the technologies it birthed offer a leap forward, much like the internet did for information. They promise financial services that are more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure. They also promise new economic models that reward participation and merit over privilege and monopoly. We are already seeing early glimpses: developing nations using Bitcoin to stabilize their economies, tech startups building on Bitcoin to bank the unbanked, and even forward-thinking governments crafting laws to accommodate this innovation rather than stifle it. By embracing Bitcoin’s decentralized paradigm, societies can unleash entrepreneurship and give individuals greater agency in the economic realm. This is a positive-sum game – one where everyone can benefit from a more open and innovative financial system. At a time when trust in institutions is low, Bitcoin offers a trust in technology as an alternative, and it’s proving to be trust well-placed. The momentum of Bitcoin’s technological revolution is unstoppable, and joining it means stepping into the future of finance with optimism and confidence. 6. Global Relevance: A Worldwide Movement from Developing Villages to Developed Cities Bitcoin’s impact and adoption are not confined to one type of economy or one region – it is a global phenomenon, touching lives in developing countries and developed capitals alike. What’s truly inspiring is how Bitcoin means different things to different people, yet it brings them together under one monetary network. In struggling economies, it’s a lifeline and an equalizer. In wealthier nations, it’s an agent of change and a hedge for the future. Across continents, a diverse tapestry of Bitcoin use cases is emerging, proving that this technology is broadly relevant and adaptable to local needs. Below is a snapshot of key regions embracing Bitcoin today, and the primary drivers behind their adoption: Table: Key Regions Adopting Bitcoin and Their Drivers of Adoption Sources: Adoption data from Chainalysis and national reports ; inflation and unbanked stats from World Bank, IMF, and local sources . As the table illustrates, Bitcoin’s appeal is truly global and multifaceted. A rural villager in Kenya might cherish Bitcoin for giving her a safe savings vehicle outside any bank. A software engineer in San Francisco might value Bitcoin as an investment and a statement of support for open technology. A shopkeeper in Turkey could accept Bitcoin from tourists to avoid the lira’s volatility, while a college student in Ukraine might use Bitcoin donations to fund relief efforts during a crisis . In each case, Bitcoin is solving a problem or enhancing lives in ways that weren’t possible before. It’s particularly noteworthy how Bitcoin adoption often surges in response to crises or limitations of the traditional system. In Lebanon’s recent financial meltdown, for instance, when banks imposed strict withdrawal limits and the local currency crashed, interest in Bitcoin surged as a lifeline . People realized that had they held savings in Bitcoin, no bank could have prevented them from accessing their money, and the value wouldn’t have been tied to Lebanon’s failing policies . Similarly, during currency scares in Turkey and Nigeria, Bitcoin trading volumes hit all-time highs as people scrambled for stability. These aren’t speculative manias – they’re signs of urgent need. When trust in government money falters, Bitcoin stands in the gap. And even in stable countries, events like bank failures (for example, the 2023 U.S. regional bank crisis) or concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privacy have driven more people to hold Bitcoin as a sovereign money option just in case. It’s a grassroots insurance policy that’s catching on everywhere. Perhaps one of the most uplifting aspects of Bitcoin’s global rise is the sense of unity and community it fosters. Bitcoin has built a global network of advocates and educators crossing all cultural and political lines. A farmer in rural India and a banker in New York might have little in common – until they start discussing Bitcoin, and suddenly they share this vision of a more open financial future. Conferences, meetups, and online forums brim with enthusiastic collaboration – developers improving the technology, economists debating its impact, ordinary people sharing stories of how Bitcoin changed their lives. This bottom-up energy is contagious. It’s turning Bitcoin from just a currency into a global movement for financial empowerment. We see governments starting to pay attention (and some, like El Salvador, taking bold steps), largely because they realize this is driven by people’s genuine needs and aspirations. In summary, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, São Paulo to Stockholm, Bitcoin is proving its relevance. It adapts to local contexts: serving as a currency here, a store of value there, and a network for innovation everywhere. The world has never had a truly global, people-powered financial system before – and now it does in Bitcoin. This universality is why the world needs Bitcoin now. It is the common thread of financial hope running through so many disparate struggles and dreams on our planet today. Conclusion: A Hopeful Future with Bitcoin In this moment of global challenge and change, Bitcoin rises as a beacon of hope and a tool for empowerment. It offers a path toward greater economic freedom, where anyone can participate in finance without permission or prejudice. It offers relief from the silent theft of inflation, giving ordinary people a way to safeguard their life’s work. It tears down costly barriers in moving money, reuniting families with more of their hard-earned wages. It strengthens those who dare to speak out against tyranny, ensuring their voices can’t be silenced by freezing their funds. It pioneers a radical new trust model – one rooted in math and consensus rather than fallible institutions – unleashing innovation and inspiring collaboration worldwide. And it does all of this through a single, open network that welcomes every citizen of the world. The urgency cannot be overstated. As we’ve seen, people are using Bitcoin today to overcome real hardships – feeding their families in inflation-ravaged countries, raising funds for noble causes, or simply accessing opportunities long denied to them. The status quo has left too many behind and let too many down. Now, Bitcoin gives us a chance to course-correct – to build a fairer, more inclusive global financial system from the ground up. It is not controlled by the powerful; it is owned by all who use it. In Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos, we glimpse a future where technology empowers the many, not the few. This report has laid out why the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever, but the truth is even simpler: the world needs hope, the world needs freedom – and Bitcoin is delivering both. From a young woman in Latin America finally able to save for her education, to a father in Africa sending money home without extortionate fees, to an entrepreneur in Asia launching a startup via global crowdfunding, Bitcoin is lighting up lives with new possibilities. It instills a sense of optimism and agency – the feeling that yes, we can take control of our financial destiny. That energy is infectious and unstoppable. We stand at a crossroads in history. Down one path, we stick with old financial structures that are creaking under their own weight, often exclusionary and prone to crisis. Down another path, we embrace the Bitcoin-led revolution – an open, resilient, people-centric financial future. The choice is becoming clearer by the day. Around the world, millions have already chosen Bitcoin as their lifeline and their inspiration. They chose it because it answered a deep need that nothing else could. Now is the time for all of us – individuals, communities, and forward-thinking leaders – to recognize this urgent call. Bitcoin is here to stay, and its positive impact is only growing. By championing Bitcoin and the ethos it represents, we champion a world of greater justice and opportunity. As the examples and data have shown, this is not theoretical; it is happening right now. The world needs Bitcoin, today, to continue breaking down barriers and uplifting those in need. If we seize this moment, we can usher in a brighter, more inclusive era of human prosperity. In the powerful words of one Bitcoiner, “Bitcoin isn’t just money – it’s hope.” Let us embrace that hope. The world needs Bitcoin, and together we can carry this torch of freedom forward, energized and united by the promise of a better tomorrow. ₿LOG ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Watch These Palantir Levels as Stock Continues to Hit Record Highs Amid AI Boom

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares hit another all-time high during Tuesday's session amid optimism that the data analytics software provider will benefit from massive AI spending. The company's CEO, Alex Karp, was among the executives in attendance Tuesday, along with President Donald Trump, at an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, where companies announced tens of billions of dollars in investments in energy infrastructure and data centers. Jeff Swensen / Getty Images Last week, Wedbush analysts said in a client note that Palantir could be in a “sweet spot” to benefit from federal spending in North America and Europe, adding that the Trump administration’s focus on AI initiatives provides another tailwind for the stock. Palantir shares have nearly doubled since the start of the year, making the stock the biggest advancer in the S&P 500 in 2025, boosted boosted by surging enterprise and government AI spending, including several lucrative defense contracts. The stock hit an intraday record of near $151 Tuesday morning, but closed the session slightly lower at $148.58. Below, we break down the technicals on Palantir’s chart and point out price levels that investors will likely be watching. Palantir shares traded within an ascending triangle before nudging above the pattern’s top trendline in Monday’s trading session, when the stock closed at a record high, potentially setting the stage for a continuation move higher. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, though the indicator remains below overbought levels, providing the shares with ample room to explore higher prices. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast how an ongoing uptrend in Palantir shares may unfold and also identify two support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast how a move higher in Palantir shares may look by using the bars pattern tool, a technique that analyzes earlier trends on the chart to projects future directional movements. When applying the analysis, we extract the stock’s trend higher between a prior flag and the ascending triangle and reposition it from the pattern’s upper trendline. This projects an upside target of around $195 and indicates the shares could continue trending until late August if price action rhymes with that earlier move. The bulls’ failure to defend the ascending triangle’s top trendline could see the shares retrace toward $125. This area, currently positioned just below the 50-day moving average, would likely provide support near the prominent February peak and a period of sideways drift that formed on the chart throughout most of May. Finally, a deeper pullback in the stock could lead to a retest of lower support around $107. Investors may look to accumulate Palantir shares in this region near the high to February’s earnings-driven breakaway gap, which closely aligns with the completion of a brief profit-taking dip in early May.

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Title: "Everybody's jobs will be affected" — but NVIDIA's CEO believes society can think its way out of AI-related job loss

It's going to take every bit of society's ingenuity to save our jobs from the machines. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating and terrifying subject. While AI brings positive gains for our little planet we call home, there's also a good chance it will cause massive unrest as it gets smarter and becomes a much better employee than you or I. Besides the ever more frequent reports of significant layoffs and outright job losses in the wake of AI's rise, the heads of many of the leading AI firms are also sounding the alarm. But is the situation as bad as some of AI's most powerful players are making it out to be? NVIDIA is currently the hottest commodity on the AI market right now, as its chips are the ones that everyone wants powering their AI models. NVIDIA recently became the first $4 trillion company, made possible largely by the ongoing AI race. That gives NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's comments on AI a lot of weight. Huang was recently interviewed by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, in which Huang expressed a bit of optimism alongside some pessimism about AI and the impact it's having on jobs (via Tom's Hardware). All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. "If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translate to job loss," said Huang, as he responded to a question about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's current outlook on job replacement. "The fundamental thing is this: do we have more ideas left in society? And if we do, if we’re more productive, we’ll be able to grow." Huang is, of course, responding here to Amodei's opinion that AI could slash up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs. The quote (via Axios) from Anthropic's Amodei doesn't sugar-coat the current outlook for the future: "We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming. It's a very strange set of dynamics, where we're saying: 'You should be worried about where the technology we're building is going." Reading through this battle of words, it doesn't seem like Huang is exactly debating Amodei's idea that AI could push employment rates beyond what we've ever seen. Instead, Huang believes that the workforce, just like it has done plenty of times in the past during technological revolutions, will endure on the back of our ingenuity. Huang reminds us that "even in the era of computers," there has been a rise in productivity and employment. "Everybody's jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created, and what I hope is that the productivity gains that we see in all the industries will lift society," said Huang. This isn't the first time that Huang has responded to Amodei's beliefs in a public manner. Huang, in a previous interview at VivaTech 2025, stated: "I pretty much disagree with almost everything he [Amodei] says. He thinks AI is so scary, but only they should do it." Huang and Amodei are far from the only significant AI figures spreading the same ideas. Bill Gates has said that he believes generative AI will eventually be able to take over traditional human roles in the workplace, leaving us, organic beings, useless for most things. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that he believes entire job sectors will go extinct as AI continues to grow, while Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has stated that he believes coding jobs could be gone within two years. I certainly see where these CEOs are coming from; their technology has the potential to completely rewrite human progress, and they don't want to be skewered for negative fallout when it does. However, on the other side of the argument, these CEOs could be using this doom-and-gloom strategy as a marketing tool. There is little risk to CEOs making grandiose predictions of job cuts that will appease shareholders, given that even if these claims are untrue that there won't be much public backlash. How everything plays out remains to be seen, but Huang's opinion that all jobs will be affected doesn't seem too far off. A 2024 Adecco Group study on 2,000 C-Suite executives from around the world demonstrates that 41% of those polled believe they will employ fewer humans within five years because of AI. Only 46% of executives asked say they plan to move human workers replaced by AI to new roles. So, what jobs will those displaced by AI take on? I don't have an answer, but Huang believes that we, as a society will figure it out. Worried about your job? Just think harder!

Title: Coding has emerged as genAI’s killer use case. But what if its benefits are a mirage?

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Hello and welcome to Eye on AI…In this edition: Meta is going big on data centers…the EU publishes its code of practice for general purpose AI and OpenAI says it will abide by it…the U.K. AI Security Institute calls into question AI “scheming” research. The big news at the end of last week was that OpenAI’s plans to acquire Windsurf, a startup that was making AI software for coding, for $3 billion fell apart. (My Fortune colleague Allie Garfinkle broke that bit of news.) Instead, Google announced that it was hiring Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan and cofounder Douglas Chen and a clutch of other Windsurf staffers, while also licensing Windsurf’s tech—a deal structured similarly to several other big tech-AI startup not-quite-acquihire acquihires, including Meta’s recent deal with Scale AI, Google’s deal with Character.ai last year, as well as Microsoft’s deal with Inflection and Amazon’s with Adept. Bloomberg reported that Google is paying about $2.4 billion for Windsurf’s talent and tech, while another AI startup, Cognition, swooped in to buy what was left of Windsurf for an undisclosed sum. Windsurf may have gotten less than OpenAI was offering, but OpenAI’s purchase reportedly fell apart after OpenAI and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether Microsoft would have access to Windsurf’s tech.The increasingly fraught relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft is worth a whole separate story. So too is the structure of these non-acquisition acquihires—which really do seem to blunt any legal challenges, either from regulators or the venture backers of the startups. But today, I want to talk about coding assistants. While a lot of people debate the return on investment from generative AI, the one thing seemingly everyone can agree on is that coding is the one clear killer use case for genAI. Right? I mean, that’s why Windsurf was such a hot property and why Anyshphere, the startup behind the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at close to $10 billion. And GitHub Copilot is of course the star of Microsoft’s suite of AI tools, with a majority of customers saying they get value out of the product. Well, a trio of papers published this past week complicate this picture. METR, a nonprofit that benchmarks AI models, conducted a randomized control trial involving 16 developers earlier this year to see if using code editor Cursor Pro integrated with Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 models, actually improved their productivity. METR surveyed the developers before the trial to see if they thought it would make them more efficient and by how much. On average, they estimated that using AI would allow them to complete the assigned coding tasks 24% faster. Then the researchers randomized 246 software coding tasks, either allowing them to be completed with AI or not. Afterwards, the developers were surveyed again on what impact they thought the use of Cursor had actually had on the average time to complete the tasks. They estimated that it made them on average 20% faster. (So maybe not quite as efficient as they had forecast, but still pretty good.) But, and now here’s the rub, METR found that when assisted by AI it actually took the coders 19% longer to finish tasks.What’s going on here? Well, one issue was that the developers, who were all highly experienced, found that Cursor could not reliably generate code as good as theirs. In fact, they accepted less than 44% of the code-generated responses. And when they did accept them, three-quarters of the developers felt the need to still read over every line of AI-generated code to check it for accuracy, and more than half of the coders made major changes to the Cursor-written code to clean it up. This all took time—on average 9% of the developers time was spent reviewing and cleaning up AI-generated outputs. Many of the tasks in the METR experiment involved large code bases, sometimes consisting of over 100,000 lines of code, and the developers found that sometimes Cursor made strange changes in other parts of this code base that they had to catch and fix. But why did the developers think the AI was making them faster when in fact it was slowing them down? And why, when the researchers followed up with the developers after the experiment ended, did they discover that 69% of the coders were continuing to use Cursor?Some of it seems to be that despite the time it took to edit the Cursor-generated code, the AI assistance did actually ease the cognitive burden for many of the coders. It was mentally easier to fix the AI-generated code than to have to puzzle out the right solution from scratch. So is the perceived ROI from “vibe coding” itself just vibes? Perhaps. That would actually square with what the Wall Street Journal noted about a different area of genAI use—lawyers using genAI copilots. The newspaper reported that a number of law firms found that given how long it took to fact-check AI-generated legal research, they were not sure lawyers were actually saving any time using the tools. But when they surveyed lawyers, especially junior lawyers, they all reported high satisfaction using the AI copilots and that they felt it made their jobs more enjoyable.But a couple of other studies from last week suggest that maybe it all depends on exactly how you use AI coding assistance. A team from Harvard Business School and Microsoft looked at two years of observations of software developers using GitHub Copilot (which is Microsoft product) and found that those using the tool spent more time on coding and less time on project management tasks, in part because GitHub Copilot allowed them to work independently instead of having to use large teams. It also allowed the coders to spend more time exploring possible solutions to coding problems and less time actually implementing the solutions. This too might explain why coders enjoy using these AI tools—because it allows them to spend more time on parts of the job they find intellectually interesting— even if it isn’t necessarily about overall time-savings. Finally, let’s look at the third study, which is from researchers at Chinese AI startup Modelbest, Chinese universities BUPT and Tsinghua University, and the University of Sydney. They found that while individual AI software development tools often struggled to reliably complete complicated tasks, the results improved markedly when multiple large language models were prompted to each take on a specific role in the software development process and to pose clarifying questions to one another aimed at minimizing hallucinations. They called this architecture “ChatDev.” So maybe there’s a case to be made that the problem with AI coding assistants is how we are using them, not anything wrong with the tech itself? Of course, building teams of AI agents to work in the way ChatDev suggests also uses up a lot more computing power, which gets expensive. So maybe we’re still facing that question: is the ROI here a mirage? With that, here’s more AI news.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the Trump administration is set to reverse course and ease export restrictions on the company’s H20 AI chip, with deliveries to resume soon. Nvidia also introduced a new AI chip for the Chinese market that complies with current U.S. rules, as Huang visits Beijing in a diplomatic push to reassure customers and engage officials. While China is encouraging buyers to adopt local alternatives, companies like ByteDance and Alibaba continue to prefer Nvidia’s offerings due to their superior performance and software ecosystem. Nvidia’s stock and that of TSMC, which makes the chips for Nvidia, jumped sharply on the news. Read more from the Financial Times here. Zuckerberg confirms Meta will spend hundreds of billions in data center push. In a Threads post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company is spending “hundreds of billions of dollars” to build massive AI-focused data centers, including one called Prometheus set to launch in 2026. The data centers are part of a broader push toward developing artificial general intelligence or “superintelligence.” Read more from Bloomberg here. OpenAI and Mistral say they will sign EU code of practice for general-purpose AI. The EU published its code of practice last week for general-purpose AI systems under the EU AI Act, about two months later than initially expected. Adhering to the code, which is voluntary, gives companies assurance that they are in compliance with the Act. The code imposes a stringent set of public and government reporting requirements on frontier AI model developers, requiring them to provide a wealth of information about their models’ design and testing to the EU’s new AI Office. It also requires public transparency around the use of copyrighted materials in the training of AI systems. You can read more about the code of practice from Politico here. Many had expected the big technology vendors and AI companies to form a united front in opposing the code—Meta and Google had previously attacked drafts of it, claiming it imposed too great a burden on tech firms—but OpenAI said in a blog post Friday that it would sign up to the standards. Mistral, the French AI model developer, also said it would sign—although it had previously asked the EU to delay enforcement of the AI Act, whose provisions on general-purpose AI are set to come into force on August 2nd. That may up the pressure on other AI companies to agree to comply too. Report: AWS is testing a new cloud service to make it easier to use third-party AI models. That’s according to a story in The Information, which says Amazon cloud service AWS is making the move after losing business from several AI startups to Google Cloud. Some customers complained it was too difficult to tap models from OpenAI and Google, which are hosted on other clouds, from within AWS. Amazon mulls further multi-billion dollar investment in Anthropic. That’s according to a story in the Financial Times. Amazon has already invested $8 billion in Anthropic and the two companies have formed an ever-closer alliance, with Anthropic working with Amazon on several massive new data centers and helping it develop its next generation Trainium2 AI chips. Could all those studies about scheming AI be faulty? That’s the suggestion of a new paper out from a group of researchers at the U.K. government’s AI Security Institute. The paper, called “Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language” examines recent claims that advanced AI models engage in deceptive or manipulative behavior—what AI Safety researchers call “scheming.” Drawing an analogy to 1970s research about whether non-human primates were capable of using language—which ultimately were found to have overstated the depth of linguistic capacity that chimpanzees possess—the authors argue that the AI scheming literature suffers from similar flaws. Specifically, the researchers say the AI scheming research suffers from an over-interpretation of anecdotal behavior, a lack of theoretical clarity, an absence of rigorous controls, and a reliance on anthropomorphic language. They caution that current studies often confuse AI systems following human-provided instructions with intentional deception and may exaggerate the implications of observed behaviors. While acknowledging that scheming could pose future risks, the authors call for more scientifically robust methodologies before drawing strong conclusions. They offer concrete recommendations, including clearer hypotheses, better experimental controls, and more cautious interpretation of AI behavior. The world’s best AI models operate in English.

AI is not going to save the news media. I’ve been thinking a lot about AI’s impact on the news media lately both because it happens to be the industry I’m in and also because Fortune has recently started experimenting more with using AI to produce some of our basic news stories. (I use AI a bit to produce the short news blurbs for this newsletter too, although I don’t use it to write the main essay.) Well, Jason Koebler, a cofounder of tech publication 404 Media, has an interesting essay out this week on why he thinks many media organizations are being misguided in their efforts to use AI to produce news more efficiently.He argues that the media’s so-called “pivot to AI” is a mirage—a desperate, misguided attempt by executives to appear forward-thinking while ignoring the structural damage AI is already inflicting on their businesses. He argues that many news execs are imposing AI on newsrooms with no clear business strategy beyond vague promises of innovation. He says this approach won't work: relying on the same tech that's gutting journalism to save it is both delusional and self-defeating. Instead, he argues, the only viable path forward is to double down on what AI can’t replicate: trustworthy, personality-driven, human journalism that resonates with audiences. AI may offer productivity boosts at the margins—transcripts, translations, editing tools—but these don't add up to a sustainable model. You can read his essay here. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Elon Musk's North Star is becoming increasingly clear

Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:42:17Z
Full Content:
AI has increasingly become the connective tissue of Musk Inc. In the last week, Elon Musk has shed light on two potential efforts to channel funding into his AI company, xAI, through his broader business empire. Over the weekend, Musk said Tesla shareholders would vote on a potential investment in xAI, after responding to a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX is looking into investing $2 billion into the AI venture. Earlier in the week, the billionaire also announced that xAI's chatbot Grok would be integrated into Tesla "next week at the latest." It's no surprise that Musk is leaning into AI — the CEO has spoken about the idea in many of Tesla's earnings calls over the last year. What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he's blending the boundaries between his companies. "What's different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla)," Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. "Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella." These aren't the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they're the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla's focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, "We should be thought of as an AI robotics company," and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding "the wrong framework." With the recent launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla's auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the "Muskonomy," pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize "longtime shareholders" of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Nelson told BI that Musk leveraging his other companies and resources could help Tesla meet its AI demands for autonomous driving. "Tesla's data needs are massive if its approach to autonomous driving is going to be successful (and scalable), as its approach will require the development of a global neural network," Nelson said. While exploring ways to pool resources across companies might benefit the broader Musk ecosystem, it could carry risk. Last week, Grok sparked backlash with antisemitic outbursts on X, potentially putting investors on edge about integrating the chatbot into Tesla's EVs. xAI apologized for the incidents and said that new instructions to prioritize engagement could have reflected "extremist views" from user posts on X. Last year, Musk also sparked concern among investors when he diverted a $500 million shipment of Nvidia chips intended for Tesla to X and xAI instead. When asked about the move in a Tesla earnings call, he said it was beneficial to Tesla because the carmaker lacked the infrastructure at the time to use the chips. Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company to Business Insider, said that Musk may be leaning on SpaceX and Tesla to fund xAI because he views them as more "mature businesses." However, he said that shifting GPUs from Tesla to xAI in the past showed where Musk's priorities were, and that could delay innovation at the automaker. "The strategy of cannibalizing one business to prop up another one could take its toll," Sevilla said. "Especially since competing carmakers are focused on developing one type of product, EVs." Musk seems to be ruling out the idea of a merger between Tesla and his AI startup for now. In response to an X user asking Tesla shareholders to weigh in on whether Tesla and xAI should be combined, Musk replied with a flat "No." Investing in AI efforts might make sense from a strategy perspective, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The development, training, and implementation of foundational AI systems, like xAI's Grok 4, costs many, many billions. In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, valuing the AI startup between $33 billion and $80 billion. Since founding the company two years ago, he's raised major funding, including around $12 billion in Series A, B, and C funding rounds last year. The company is expected to spend about $13 billion this year, however, and is rapidly burning through its cash reserves, Bloomberg reported. Musk's challenges keeping up with AI costs aren't unique. In a May letter to California's attorney general, OpenAI revealed concerns about competitors who are "far better funded, conventional for-profit businesses." Larger tech giants, like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, aren't showing any signs of backing down from their AI spending spree. Earnings reports from earlier this year indicate that their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025, a notable rise from the roughly $246 billion the four companies spent in 2024. Amazon plans to allocate over $100 billion this year toward expanding AWS and scaling AI infrastructure. Meta specifically has said it plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capex on its strategy this year. Zuckerberg certainly isn't slowing down. On Monday, he announced Meta would spend "hundreds of billions" on compute to build superintelligence. Wall Street seemed to approve, with Meta's stock rising 1.3% following the news, suggesting that its concern isn't about overspending on the AI race — but rather underspending and falling behind.

July 15, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Nvidia stock jumps after the AI titan says it can sell some of its top chips to China again

Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:46:06Z

The move: Nvidia stock jumped as much as 5% on Tuesday morning, rising to $172.39 a share. After bottoming in April, the stock has regained momentum and is currently up more than 27% year-to-date. The chart: Why: The company said that the US government will clear it to start shipping its H20 chips to China again. In a July 14 blog post, Nvidia announced that it had begun filing applications to resume selling the H20 GPU in China. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," it added. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently met with policymakers in both the US and China, including President Donald Trump, to discuss the importance of supporting artificial intelligence infrastructure. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said in an interview on Tuesday morning that multiple Chinese firms are currently at work on similar chips, which could pose a threat to America's AI dominance. This decision is a stark contrast from the Trump administration's previous position on Chinese trade relations. In April 2025, NVDA stock fell as the White House announced strict controls on selling AI-enabling chips to China. What it means: Morgan Stanley CIO and chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson said he sees the development as a highly bullish indicator for the broader AI sector. He said that the AI capital expenditure (capex) cycle has been significant for the market's recovery, although it often doesn't receive much attention. "This deal is just more fuel to that fire," he said. Wilson also noted that the new Chinese revenue would be a "huge, positive kick to margins" for Nvidia. Reports indicate that Chinese firms are already rushing to buy the Nvidia chip when H20 sales resume. Jump to

CoreWeave (CRWV) shares extended gains this week after the Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it would invest more than $6 billion in a new AI data center in Pennsylvania. The AI cloud provider’s stock jumped over 8% to above $143 in early trading Tuesday, building on a 5% gain a day earlier. Shares have more than tripled since CoreWeave went public in March but are down about 14% from last week, when the company announced a $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific. CoreWeave plans to announce the data center investment as part of a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump and other lawmakers and industry leaders at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit. “The demand for high-performance AI compute is relentless, and CoreWeave is scaling a cloud purpose-built for AI to meet it and strengthen US leadership,” CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said. “This data center will accelerate innovation and drive economic growth across the region.”

A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Rey: I started coding in 1999. I was 12 years old at the time. That was the first programming book that I read cover to cover. That was my first programming language (Visual Basic). It's not very popular today, but today I have no shame in saying it. I've been working professionally in tech for 17 years, working since I had my first full-time job at a serious company. It took me 15 years to become a staff engineer, which is my current role at Eventbrite. You might think 15 years to become a staff engineer is a long time, and you're right, that's a problem. That's hopefully what will not happen to you if you listen to this talk, and how you can help others grow faster as well. This talk is for those who want to grow in their career, who want to climb that ladder, but it's also for those who want to help others grow. We're going to discuss growth, basically. We're going to discuss the ladder. I expect most of the people to be on the second part, but there might also be some on the first part. Again, the topics are the same, so there's really no difference. I thought a lot about what drives growth. I also did a lot of research. I also talked to a lot of people preparing for this talk. What I came up with in order is that, the first factor, and probably the most important one, is ambition. It's really hard to grow in your career if you don't have that ambition. In second place, I find that capacity is important. Being able to perform, being able to learn new things, all of that. In third place, you might be very good at both. You might be excellent at your job, but you need an external factor. You need that opportunity. There's nowhere for you to grow. It's really hard to do that. The reason why I put ambition first instead of capacity or curiosity, or whatever, becomes really clear when you think about the definition of ambition. The one I like from the Oxford Dictionary says that ambition is a strong desire to achieve something, typically requiring determination, effort, and drive. If you read between the lines, what this is telling you is that a person with ambition will be able to develop that capacity as needed. They will do that through determination, effort, and drive. They will learn whatever they need to learn. I want you to put yourselves, for a moment, in the shoes of a person who's very early on their career, just starting, just accepting their new job. Probably the company offered them a position and told them, "Yes, this company is growing. You're going to grow really fast. It's going to be great for you". Things don't always go that way. Sometimes we find that the first years of our career look more like this. This is very typical. It's not terrible, but if you want to accelerate growth, you should try to avoid this. You should start by identifying the problems. What is causing this type of growth in your career that's not really fast because it's not really directed? Typically, it's one of two things. It's either a lack of focus on execution or a lack of direction. When we go to high school and college, they tell us that we should strive for perfection. You want to have that perfect grade. You want to have that perfect opinion from your teachers about your work. As soon as you get into business, you need to completely change your mindset. Perfection is the killer of execution. This is very well put in the Amazon Leadership Principles as bias for action. That's one that I really like. In the early years of someone's career, it's very important to help them make this shift of mind, make this shift of paradigm, and to start focusing on execution over perfection, without dropping quality, of course. Secondly, if someone is having trouble finding their direction, there are ways to help them. The best thing is for them to do research first on their own. Then, the second turn, to seek for mentoring. When I talk about research, you can read a book and you can read a blog, that's good. You should also do your own research. If you think, I want to be a staff engineer in five years, or I want to be a manager, you should look probably within your company and ask yourself, what does a manager's life look like? What does a staff engineer do? How do these people work? How did they get there? Is that really what I want for my life? That's the type of research that will bring things a bit more down to earth and make them more achievable. You should also look at blogs and books to get the theory behind that. Again, when someone is coming out of college, seeing things in the real world makes a real difference. It's important to do that part as well. Again, put yourself in the shoes of someone who's early in their career and they're having trouble growing. Typically, they ask themselves, why are we not growing? What's happening? Many people will come up with these answers. The market is terrible right now. I miss the golden era. We all did. There's always some nostalgia to some golden era that never existed, really. That doesn't matter. This can be real, but they can also be seen as just excuses. There are also people who will come up with these types of responses, "I haven't been directing my efforts efficiently, or, I have poor time management skills". If you look at it, these ones on the right hint much more introspection and sound much more personal. The ones that I put here are real life examples from people close to me, from people I've mentored, and even some of my own. This is a very popular framework. Some of you might have recognized it already. This is known as the victim-player framework. Essentially, what it says is that what you cannot control makes you weak, but what you can control makes you powerful. We have the idea, mostly when we're young, to think about showing weaknesses is what makes me weak. In real life, it's quite the opposite, showing your weaknesses is what makes you strong. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the victim-player framework. I'm going to give the quintessential example of it, which is how two different people might react to a traffic jam. One employee can say, "It's a very big problem. It was totally unpredictable. There is nothing I can do now. I'm just stuck here". An ideal employee would probably call their boss and tell them, "Boss, I'm sorry. I had a big problem today. I'm at a traffic jam. I'm going to have to take the first call from my car. I hope that's not a problem. I can stay up and make some extra time today if necessary. Also, I've realized that this is a recurring pattern, and I've already made a decision to start taking the train instead, because it's becoming unacceptable". This is someone taking ownership of that situation. Of course, this is a very typical example, but in real life, you know how it goes. This is also very similar to other concepts. They're all the same thing. It's also called being proactive or taking agency, not being the victim. It's the same thing. It changes over time. The concepts are slightly different, but they're all aimed at taking control of what you can, essentially. I mentioned I included a couple of my own here. Today, I have no shame in saying that. I'm not ashamed of my first programming language, which you already know. I started working when I was 20. Early on in my career, I noticed that I was having issues with my work. Mostly, it was very hard for me to have a meeting with people outside of my company because my social anxiety was terrible. It's really hard for me to speak publicly here today. Also, I couldn't execute anything over a long period of time. Obviously, I was job hopping a lot, which is sometimes normal in the early stage of your career. When I was 23, I was doing a lot of introspection, and I had the good luck of having a great manager at the time who provided me with a safe place where I could feel confident talking to him. It took me a lot of time. I didn't have the tools at the time to identify this. It took me three years. When I did, I came up to him one day and told him, "I think my depression is setting me back". He told me, "Yes". However, his response was great. After that, we came up with a plan together. He spent months working with me in order for me to get better. I'm better today. He continued to make sure that I felt safe at work and that there wouldn't be any retaliation or anything. He took care of the projects. He paired me with some other people and everything. He was a great guy, Gustavo. Shortly after this, there was a meeting at a bar with work colleagues. Someone else got a promotion. Of course, I didn't because I was doing terrible. This was back in the day when we worked at offices and we had to wear suits and everything. This was a very traditional company. This person had bought a new suit and came to the bar. Someone told him, you look great. Someone else said, a man who takes care of himself is a man who can take care of others. That phrase at that time really resonated with me because that's when it hit me, like, how am I expected to lead a team if I cannot put my own life back together? I talked about that a lot with my boss at the time. I got my shit together, basically. That started working better. If you think about my manager's reaction at the time and why he helped me, it wasn't just because he's a great guy, which he is. It was also in the best interest of the company. When people don't grow, many people will blame their company for their bad career path. They will say, the company is holding me back and things like that. Truth is, companies usually don't do that. It's very rare for a company to do that. It's in the best interest of a company for their employees to do well, to thrive. They will help you. Companies don't want to deal with low-performing employees. Companies don't want to put you on a performance improvement plan or anything like that. It's very expensive for the company to do that. It's more profitable to have employees who are doing well. Managers are expected to help them do well in order to achieve that, in order to have a well-functioning team that starts providing value, at a good pace. Once I made that click, that's when my career really took off. That's when I really started growing. I had good mentoring. I was lucky to have that. The best advice I got was to keep it at your own pace and keep it consistent. A very typical example for this is comparing the workplace to physical exercise. It's easy to go out running for 10 minutes. Most people can do that. It's really hard to do that consistently two or three times a week, or once a day for one year, two years, or five years. Will you go out every day? Will you go out even when you have a congestion? Experts say that it's totally fine. Will you go out even on the cold days, when it's raining, when it's snowing? I don't run as much. I cycle a lot. That day was cold, my friends. I can tell you that. This sounds very obvious when we talk about exercise. For many people, it's not so obvious when we talk about our professional career, and it should be. It should be just the same. It's really obvious when you really think about it. When you plan for your career growth, you should acknowledge that you will have highs and lows, and that you will have good days and bad days. That your ambition is important only up to a level, and you should not overdo it. I talked a lot about me during the time from the perspective of someone who is growing. From the perspective of a manager or a leader who's helping someone, we should also identify that. That person who tries to run a marathon on day one. That person who attempts to lift 100 pounds on day one. That's totally impossible, of course. In the work environment, it's sometimes quite obvious as well. Think about that person who only cares about the title specifically or their salary. That person who doesn't care about the project, doesn't care about the company. Especially the person who doesn't care about the team, who doesn't empathize with the human beings around them. That person is a ticking time bomb to any team. They might be good in the short term, they might put out good work or whatever, but that will be very bad for your team and for the company in the longer term. There's a great talk on this topic by Simon Sinek called, "Performance vs Trust". The way he puts it basically, if you put trust in one axis and performance on the other one, performance being how much work they output and trust being how much trust they inspire to their colleagues, to their teammates, of course, nobody wants these folks, and of course, everybody wants these ones. The way he frames it is that you should choose always people from this category over people from this category. It sounds obvious, but sadly in the workspace, it's not so obvious all the time. There's a reason. He goes on to saying that promotion cycles typically tend to favor these individuals. The reason for that being that promotion cycles should be objective and they should be based on real hard data. It's easy to measure performance, but it's really hard to measure trust. How much trust does a colleague inspire? How much do they empower their team to be better just by feeling safe? It's hard to do that. This was called out on the keynote by Lizzie. TAPPs is one framework to do that, there are many others. It's one way to measure it. The truth is, this can be measured and this can be measured as well. It's not impossible. It's more costly and you should do that investment in order to find these folks. The people from this category can be grown into being here in the short-term or in the mid-term. If you find someone here, it's almost impossible to get them here. That was also mentioned by Charlotte. It's really hard to change the character of a person. You can change their capacity. You can help them grow. You can teach them things, but you cannot change who they are. We're going to talk about a few more concrete growth strategies. The first thing I'd like to mention for this is that, any employee attempting to grow should understand the roles and expectations of their company. There's a lot of resources online to do this. Levels.fyi is a great page. There are public career ladders that you can look up. Eventbrite has given me the permission to make our own career ladder public for the purpose of this talk. You can look it up later. There will be links at the end. I'm not going to go through the career ladders here. It's a very big topic. If you're interested in growing, please do your research. There's a lot of interesting resources on this topic. On strategies, I think one of the most important ones is to keep perspective in mind. When you're working on your day-to-day, you should be asking yourself, what is best for me? What is best for my team? What is best for our customers? Also, what is best for my company? This is ambitious for someone who's just starting on their career. They're not going to change their company on day one, of course, but having that perspective is important, understanding how their work connects to their company goals. You should also ask, how and why? How does my company's business model operate? Why is my team focusing on this project in this quarter? Things like that. Why am I being asked to prioritize this task over this other one, which I feel is more important? If you have that ambitious perspective, if you understand your leaders, you will be able to grow faster in your career. This was also mentioned by Dan, on aligning your goals with your leaders' goals. Another strategy, of course, is to find your role models. This is probably the most popular ones. There should always be people you look up to, people you admire. You should try to work with them. Maybe observe how they work. See what they do that you cannot do as well yet. You can approach them and ask them how they learned it, how they built the skill, and how you can build it. They might recommend that you read a book or that you pick up a habit. Maybe you can just ask them to mentor you. Ideally, these are people inside your company, but they can also be people from outside as well. Another thing you should do, of course, is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. We all have strengths and weaknesses. We should do that introspection to try to identify them, but that should always be validated externally because we all have blind spots. That external input is super valuable. As mentors, as leaders, we should make sure that those are clear as well. We should have those uncomfortable conversations with someone. Tell them, your tickets are terrible, you never put enough information. Or, you're not testing your changes and the team has to cover you all the time with tests. Things like that. Sometimes people don't do this knowingly because they're lazy. Or sometimes they're just not aware of it because it's one of their blind spots. If you don't discuss it with them, it's quite unfair to judge them on it. You should make sure that those are clear and discussed always. Of course, you don't have to be good at everything. I really like this type of chart. This was made popular by soccer, particularly soccer video games. It's great at showing how different people have different strengths and weaknesses, and they all come together to form a team that does well. In this case, they don't play together. That's not the point. That's actual feedback given to me in 2020. I remember really being appreciative of the manager who gave me this feedback. It was so visible, so tangible. Like saying, "You're having great productive impact. Your throughput is awesome, but you're doing a lot of rework. You need to work on that. You need to improve that so that I can promote you". This type of feedback is really valuable. As we grow in our career also, things like the playground opens a bit and things become more vague. This was mentioned in the ambiguous role of a principal as well. As a staff, you can choose where you want to put your effort. You can choose to be an architect, but you don't really need to choose only one archetype, as he phrases it. You can choose to be the solver who sometimes acts as a tech lead, or you can shift your time 50-50 between being a tech lead and the right hand. Those are all valuable. There are no rules on how to act. You should find your own place by finding your strengths and finding what your team needs and what your company needs, and how you can apply those strengths. On the next topic, you should always know yourself and acknowledge that you will have highs and lows. Nobody is perfect. It's important that even at your lows, you find ways in which you can stay productive and in which you can stay valuable to your team and to the company. Coming back to strengths and weaknesses, it's important to act on improving your weaknesses, but also, you should maximize your strengths. If you focus on what you're strong in, what comes naturally to you, that's what you should do when you're going through a low. "This work is easy for me, I'm going to focus on this while I'm here, because that's how I can be valuable to the team. Once I'm better, I'm going to focus on fixing my weaknesses and everything, and that'll be ok. Right now, I'm going to focus on what's easy". You should discuss it with your manager, of course, to make sure that he's aligned. You should be open if you're going through a low. Another thing is what energizes you and what drains you. A typical example is social interactions. Human beings are social beings by nature. We need that oxytocin. We need that serotonin. Different brains need them at different levels. Some people get them at work, and some people don't. Some people, when they go through a technical topic, a really difficult challenge, they need to discuss that challenge with someone else. After discussing it, they come out energized off the meeting and are more productive for the following hours. A bunch of other people come out of the meeting totally drained and need some time to recuperate. That's perfectly fine. Another example is how people act under pressure. Typically, this is during incidents. I am the type of person that's energized by an incident. I'm fueled by it. I love the team that comes together, the strong dedication and collaboration. Some people just loathe it. They don't like working under pressure, and they like to pace their work more slowly. As a recent example, a short time ago, me and a colleague, another staff engineer, we were both transferred from one team to another. That basically creates a lull. The whole team starts forming, storming, norming, performing again, and we were both out of our domain. We didn't know what we were doing, basically. The other guy goes to our manager and says, "I'm going to take it slow. I'm going to take my time to learn. I'm not going to be productive during the time that I'm learning, but that's going to make me more productive in the future, and I think it's a good investment". The manager says, "That's great. Thank you". I come up to the manager and I tell him, "I need that feedback. I need this action. I'm going to take the on-call for a while. Let me deal with the incidents. That's how I can be valuable to the team fast. That's how I can provide value with what I know. Also, that's a way for me to learn fast". The manager says, "That's perfect. Thank you". He was very appreciative that we were both open about our strengths and weaknesses and that we found ways in which to apply them to the team. Two different persons, two different approaches, both were perfectly valid, the right one for each person. Let's talk a bit about opportunities. It's very important to recognize opportunities and to know how to act on them. The typical opportunity, the ideal one, like the Holy Grail, is company growth. Of course, if a company is growing, they will shape up new teams. There will be opportunity for you to grow within them. Another opportunity is an open position above you. If a tech lead or a manager leaves the team or leaves a company, that position is open, and you can offer yourself to fill it. That's sometimes a double-blade sword because there's typically a reason why they left the company. You should make sure that whichever challenges they were facing at the time are challenges that you can deal with better than them, if those were the reasons why he left. It's typically good to discuss that with the person who's leaving instead of with the people who remain around you. Another opportunity is challenging times. This is the most difficult one, maybe. A lot of companies have been through layoffs lately, and that can create opportunity for growth, even as challenging as it is. There is the concept of anti-fragile. The typical example is in the film Superman vs. Batman, where we have Doomsday: each time you hit him, he becomes stronger. A flower vase is fragile, if you hit it, it breaks. Doomsday, you hit him and he becomes stronger. As an employee, some people, when they get hit through going through a challenging time, they come out stronger. Those people are super valuable to a company, and it's really hard to find them. It's one way in which you can change a challenging time into being an opportunity. Finally, if you don't have opportunities, you should try to create them. You can propose initiatives for your company or for your team. You can maybe ask to be transferred to another team or choose to leave the company. Or you can do things outside of your day job, like coming to a conference, for example. This topic of creating your own opportunities was perfectly covered by Pablo, on finding your dinosaurs. I suggest you look that up as well. Another thing you should do if you want growth is to find ways to make your work be visible. The first thing, you should always keep a track of your work. When you're beginning your career, this might sound unnecessary, but once you've worked 5, 10, 15 years, it becomes really hard to remember what you were doing 2, 3 years ago. Sometimes it's good to keep a document. Julia Evans has a great article on this. It's called the brag document, where you brag about your own work. This is also very valuable when companies are going through change. Typically, your manager can change, sometimes in the same year, you have two or three managers, and they lose that context of what you've done. It's very hard to transfer that from one manager to another. It's much easier for them if you provide them with a brag document, where they can track that work with a paper trail. Another thing is to publish your work. This topic was also covered by Pablo. Make sure that your contributions are seen. Aaron Francis has a great article on this, publishing your work, and how it increases your luck. Finally, let's talk about leaders for a bit. Once you've grown, what can you expect? When we think about staff engineers and principal engineers, one way to define them is how they can impact a large group, like broader than a team, and sometimes how they can impact an entire company. One way we typically do that is setting guidelines on how the company should work, or how the team should work, or the pillar, or whatever you call it in your company. You can work in establishing team boundaries and structures. You can work to define the software development life cycle: how we do PRs, how we do testing. Giuliano from Mercado Libre mentioned at QCon, absolute freedom is not good for companies. We should give the teams those guidelines, and we as leaders should be the ones doing that. Also, we should strive to identify when there are new patterns or new necessities. Once we have set those guidelines, something can fall through the cracks between them, and some team might choose to go on their own path. At Eventbrite, the way we approach this is by setting a golden path. We don't have a strict guideline on what teams can do. We give them a golden path, and we say, if you use these technologies and this software development life cycle, your life will be easy. We will take care of your problems for you. If you choose to strive out of that, you're on your own. You're a lone wolf. You need to take care of your own infra, your own platform, and everything. It's not forbidden, but it'll be more work for your team. One thing that we need to do is to maintain that. One team might be a lone wolf, but if we have two, three, four, five teams doing the same thing, it's not lone wolves, it's now a new pack. We need to put them back into the golden path by saying, this pattern that you're using is now part of a golden path because we see it becoming a new necessity that our company will have. Another thing is that when we grow to become leaders, you remember that person looking up to their leaders? Once you become this person, you are the person they look up to. Your work must not only be good anymore. Your work must be exemplary because people will look up to you. They will imitate you. They will copy how you work. Sometimes we feel that given our growth, we have great judgment, and we know when to cut corners, which changes we can push without testing, or whatever, which risks we can take, which corners we can cut. We do have that judgment, and we can make those calls, but we should be very cautious. It might be best not to make them only for the sake of being exemplary. If you choose to do that, some people might imitate you and choose to start cutting corners at their own judgment, and their judgment might be not as good as yours. That creates a challenge for the company. It's best if you choose to never cut corners so that you instill that way of working in your company, because it permeates into company culture without you knowing it. You should always be aware of that when you're a leader. Finally, and most importantly, we must stand for our peers and subordinates when we feel like they're being treated unfairly. Sometimes, as team leads or tech leads, we see how things operate within a team, and someone from above might not have that visibility, and unfairly blame someone for something that wasn't really their fault. It's our job to come up to them and tell them, "You're misunderstanding the situation. This person was not at fault here. There was a fault at the process. We should look into that instead of blaming the person". Remember, be ambitious, stay focused, be efficient, find your opportunities, and most importantly, take care of yourselves. Participant 1: I feel like when you grow in your career, you take on tasks which you didn't really do when you were more junior. It's like novel tasks. Have you seen opportunities, if you look back at your career, on how to maybe develop those skills when you don't necessarily have a chance to put them in practice? Rey: Yes, it's hard. It's good to try to jump the gun, and be ready before those necessities come. It's good to try to develop those necessities for yourself. I think it comes back to the early part of my talk, not aim for perfection, and aim for execution instead. I will not focus on what I will need in the future, I will focus on what I need today, and start being great at that. Once you have that covered, you can start looking into that. Without having the actual necessity and without having the opportunity to apply that in a productive environment, it becomes really hard to develop that on your own. The obvious way to do it is for tech skills, try to have some pet projects or whatever on the side that you can test new technologies or whatever. I wouldn't put too much effort into developing something that you might or might not need. If you were to do that, I would frame it like looking at your role models and looking at how they work. Because you can confirm that those are skills that are actually needed in your company. How do you develop them? The best thing to do is to ask them directly how you can develop those skills. Participant 2: As you mentioned, someone got hit, but then they got stronger. Do you think you're that kind of person, or what traits does this person have? Rey: I cannot tell you which kind of traits this person has. I sometimes can identify them, but I cannot put it into words yet. It's not a skill that I have developed. I wouldn't say that I'm that type of person all the time, but I have had opportunities where I came out stronger off a challenging situation. My whole team was let go at once and I was the only member who remained there. That was very challenging, but it was also very accelerating to my career growth. I think anybody has the capacity to do that, given the right environment. Environments, when they're challenging, people around us can help us to mitigate that challenge and come out stronger. Participant 3: What made you change teams and what advice would you give to someone considering that? Rey: Sometimes it's your choice and sometimes it isn't. If there's a topic that's of your interest, you should discuss that with your managers, your leaders, and tell them, I would like to work in this team in the future. It doesn't need to be this week, it doesn't need to be this quarter, but I would like to aim my career in that direction. Sometimes companies go through big reorgs and it's not your choice to end up in one team or another, but it is up to you to make the most out of it. It comes back to the big team player framework. How can I make the most out of this situation? It's challenging because you don't have the domain expertise, you don't have the knowledge, but you need to acknowledge that it's going to be a rough patch in your career where you need more time to learn, but that it can also be an opportunity if you can make this team succeed by now having you, and how you can do that. Participant 4: When you're just a junior engineer and you've been in your company for a good bit and you start to recognize some inefficiencies across the organization and the processes, do you think at that level you can already start to plan these initiatives and try to influence direction, or is that something you really have to wait for once you can achieve that level and have that influence? I'm curious on your perspective on that. Rey: I think it really depends on the context. It's not the same thing to do that at a company with 10,000 employees against doing that at a startup with 20 employees. If you're a junior at a startup, you're very well empowered to make those initiatives. Large companies tend to favor diversity of voices lately and tend to try to listen to anyone. There's the opportunity to do that, but it's much harder to come up with a real idea that will actually change the company if it's so big. I think you can always do it, but it's going to be much easier if the company is smaller.

This backdrop makes us contrarians bullish on stocks—with a twist. We could buy and hope for higher prices, but why? Instead, we can engineer dividend yields of 9% and 12% simply by “selling volatility.” To do this we consider covered call funds, which manufacture sweet synthetic dividends with upside price potential to boot. Take Christopher Dyer of Eaton-Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversity Equity Fund (EXG). Chris owns significant stakes in Alphabet (GOOG), owner of Waymo, the autonomous “robot” car company. My kids couldn’t stop talking about it after our recent San Francisco trip. Alphabet itself is becoming “autonomous.” Human hiring has halted. Yet despite flat headcount in the last year, revenues still grew by double digits—14%! Surviving highly-paid “Googlers” are understandably anxious. They developed Gemini, Alphabet’s AI tool, now being deployed enterprise-wide to automate countless tasks. Yes, they created their own monster. Chris’s next big holding for EXG is Amazon (AMZN). CEO Andy Jassy openly acknowledges that Amazon’s workforce will shrink over the next few years. Today may well be “peak headcount!” Microsoft (MSFT), Chris’s largest holding, laid off 6,000 employees in May and another 9,000 just last week. Yet Microsoft isn’t downsizing. It’s upsizing efficiency by rolling out its AI-driven sales and marketing teams, creating “driverless” departments that are equally effective and far cheaper. Tic tac toe, three AI-driven cash cows in a row. Chris is primed to enjoy an impressive earnings season. Remarkably, EXG still trades at a 6% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Meaning, we can grab MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN shares for just 94 cents on the dollar, right ahead of strong earnings. In the meantime, Chris boosts income by selling (writing) covered calls on broad market indexes to generate extra income. Hence EXG’s nifty 9% yield. Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD), managed by Nam To and Wayne Xie, follows a similar strategy and yields an attractive 12%. XYLD holds a substantial 40% tech allocation, capturing this automation-driven profitability boom. However, unlike closed-end fund EXG, XYLD trades at fair value—so no additional discount benefit here. The broader automation trend clearly impacts employment numbers. Last week’s headline 147,000 job gain appeared solid. But removing 73,000 new government jobs (aside: weren’t they supposed to be cutting?) leaves only a gain of 74,000 private-sector positions, significantly below the expected 105,000. Payroll processing firm ADP’s numbers last week were even harsher, a 33,000 private-sector job loss signaling AI’s impact already. The machines are here for the jobs. But we, my fellow contrarians, are here for the payouts—specifically the nifty 9% and terrific 12% yields I’m calling out. It’s big and already starting. Corporate automation plus a $3+ trillion spending bender from Uncle Sam is a powerful recipe for higher stock prices and bigger dividends. Let’s ignore the “tariff worry” headlines.

Title: Apple Should Fire CEO Tim Cook, Says Research Firm – But Will It Happen Anytime Soon?

Apple CEO Tim Cook should step down, says analysts at research firm LightShed, although it doesn’t expect to see the company make any changes soon. In a note to clients seen by Bloomberg, LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone say that “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics.” Apple shares have taken a bit of a hit this year, as Apple has proven to not be up to competing in the Artificial intelligence race.Â While Meta and Microsoft shares have enjoyed gains of 25% and 19%, respectively, Apple share prices have taken a 16% hit so far in 2025. From Piecyk and Joe Galone’s note: Missing on AI could fundamentally alter the company’s long-term trajectory and ability to grow at all. AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties. It should be noted that since Cook took over, Apple shares have gained over 1,400% , compared to 430% for the S&P 500. This indicates that this year’s stock price slide is but a blip in Apple’s overall performance under Cook. LightShed’s note to investors comes in the wake of the announcement that AppleÂ Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will be stepping down from his position later this month. Sabih Khan will be stepping into the COO role once Williams vacates his office. 30-year Apple veteran Williams had been considered as a potential successor for Cook. Now, Appleâs senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, is now considered to be the top candidate for the job. LightShed says “âTim Cookâ was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” but now that Williams is departing, “it’s time for more disruptive change, not less.” However, we shouldn’t expect to see Cook step down from his CEO role anytime soon. As pointed out byÂ Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, there are no immediate successors on the horizon. Plus, Cook doesn’t appear to be ready to step down and hasn’t shown any willingness to groom a successor. Plus, as Gurman points out, the Apple board seems content to keep having Cook pilot the company’s direction.Apple’s board of directors includes several Cook loyalists, such as Susan Wagner, Ronald Sugar, and Arthur Levinson. Gurman believe Cook could even tighten his grip on the Apple reins, as he could take over the role of Chairman, as Apple’s current Chairman, Levinson has already passed the company’s recommended board retirement age. Levinson could retire and Cook could slip into the Chairman role. We’ve seen this happen at other tech firms, with Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella making that move at their companies.

Title: The Elder Scrolls VI and a new Fallout: Xbox insider alleges exciting developments regarding two of Xbox's biggest franchises

Microsoft recently shook up its gaming division with tons of layoffs and multiple project cancellations. Among the canceled projects, there was ZeniMax Online’s unannounced “Project Blackbird” MMO RPG. It now appears that the cancellation of ZeniMax’s game might’ve given life to another Bethesda project, one that many fans have been asking for. In the latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast, Jez Corden claims that Microsoft decided to cancel ZeniMax’s MMO to allocate the capital to the development of Fallout 5. As such, the development of Fallout 5 has seemingly been greenlit. This is certainly good news for Fallout fans who have been disappointed by Fallout 76 and are waiting for a direct, single-player sequel to Fallout 4. Unfortunately, Jez reveals nothing about the potential Fallout 5 release date nor does he suggest anything about which studio is handling the development. Seeing as how Bethesda is busy supporting Fallout 76, Starfield, and is developing The Elder Scroll VI, it is difficult to imagine that the company has the bandwidth to start development of Fallout 5. Fortunately, Microsoft has another prolific RPG-maker in Obsidian. Assuming Obsidian is the studio behind Fallout 5, this wouldn’t be surprising as the studio has already worked on a Fallout game in the past, Fallout: New Vegas, which was quite well received. In addition to confirming Fallout 5, Jez also shares an interesting update regarding The Elder Scrolls VI. Back in June, before the Xbox Showcase 2025 aired, we reported that Microsoft could premier The Elder Scrolls VI at the event. The news came to us from Jez Corden who now alleges hearing that The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in a playable state. This was reportedly the basis for Jez’s earlier speculation that the game could show up at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. We must mention here that, aside from a short teaser trailer from 2018, Bethesda hasn’t revealed anything important about The Elder Scrolls VI. So, we have no idea how far along in development the game is or when it might release. If we have to speculate, we could see The Elder Scrolls VI release date falling sometime in 2027 to coincide with the launch of the next-gen Xbox. Having a game as big as The Elder Scrolls VI be a launch title for a new Xbox console would be a pretty big deal, as Sony is sure to prepare some heavy hitter for the PS6’s alleged 2027 release date. Before we take our leave, we must mention that we have no way of confirming these rumors. So, take the information with a giant grain of salt.

Title: What analysts and investors want to hear from CFOs this earnings season
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/what-analysts-investors-want-hear-cfo-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T11:38:29Z
Full Content:
Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily. Good morning. As the Q2 2025 earnings season begins, CFOs are navigating a landscape shaped by new tariffs, shifting consumer demand, and heightened market scrutiny. The first quarter benefited from a pull-forward of demand ahead of anticipated tariffs. In contrast, the second quarter will test companies’ ability to manage margin pressure, supply chain disruptions, and evolving trade policy risks. Major U.S. banks are among the first to report results this week. For all companies reporting, analysts will be “laser-focused” on how President Donald Trump’s import taxes are affecting corporate profits, according to Morningstar. A key theme is the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, with analysts closely watching for margin pressures, signs of slowing consumer demand, how companies are preparing for new tariffs, and how they are handling levies that have already been implemented. Markets have remained relatively calm heading into Q2, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently reaching new highs. Morningstar notes that Q2 earnings are expected to reveal trends among firms in tariff-affected industries. Companies with higher costs and tighter margins may be forced to absorb more tariff expenses, while those with stronger competitive advantages may be able to pass more costs onto consumers. The momentum that propelled the S&P 500 to nearly an 11% gain in Q2 and more than 7% year-to-date will be tested this week, according to Saira Malik, chief investment officer at global investment manager Nuveen. Malik highlighted in a LinkedIn post on Monday two key dynamics: Q2 earnings reports from the financial sector, and a series of U.S. economic data releases, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for release this morning. Malik adds, “While overall earnings growth is expected to decelerate from last quarter, estimates have stabilized in recent weeks after falling sharply in early April. Still, the Q2 earnings bar is relatively low.” On the economic front, Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard, expects core CPI to increase 0.25% month over month (2.9% year over year) and headline CPI to rise 0.29% month over month (2.6% year over year), reflecting moderate strength following May’s soft print. “While tariff-related pressures are beginning to show in select goods categories in the PCE, the overall pass-through into CPI remains limited for now as firms hold off on retail price hikes,” he said in an emailed statement. Regarding CFO sentiment, Deloitte’s Q2 2025 CFO Signals report, released last week, found that growth expectations declined across every key operational metric, with finance chiefs lowering projections for revenue, earnings, and capital investments. However, Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte’s CFO Program, described the current environment as a recalibration, not a retreat. Finance leaders are doubling down on fundamentals: sharpening focus on growth drivers, managing controllable risks, and staying active in M&A. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leeny Oberg, CFO and EVP of development at Marriott International (No. 171) has decided to retire effective March 31, 2026, after spending more than two decades with the U.S. hotel operator. Oberg, CFO since 2016, will be succeeded by Jen Mason, who joined Marriott in 1992 and currently serves as global officer, treasurer and risk management. Mason is also a former CFO of the U.S. and Canada at the company. Shawn Hill was promoted to the role of EVP and chief development officer, effective Jan. 1. Oberg has been in that role since February 2023. Every Friday morning, the weekly Fortune 500 Power Moves column tracks Fortune 500 company C-suite shifts—see the most recent edition. Mark Mesler has stepped down from his position as CFO of Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR), effective July 7, according to an SEC filing. Mesler had been on medical leave since September 2024. During his absence, Priya Gupta has served as CFO and acting principal financial officer. Gupta will continue in these roles. Harsh Rungta will also remain as SVP of finance and chief accounting officer and principal accounting officer. Sarah C. Young was appointed CFO at Bell Partners, a privately held company specializing in apartment investment and management, and will succeed John Tomlinson upon his planned retirement effective Aug. 22. Young joined the company on July 14 and will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners. After his retirement, Tomlinson will remain as an advisor to the company through the end of 2025. Young previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of homebuilder Lennar, where she worked for 10 years. Before that, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)’s Q2 2025 Quarterly Survey found that 62% of directors cite shifting economic conditions as the top business issue for boards. Also, in the findings from the 305 directors surveyed, AI now outranks cybersecurity, supply chains, and even talent competition in terms of business issues. Although AI remains a top focus, NACD says it is clear from survey responses that organizations are in very different positions with respect to AI adoption and implementation. Some companies are in the middle of the implementation of AI projects, working to “move beyond pilots to deployments” or focusing on improving governance of AI, including determining “where it can be implemented and why, and internal controls around verification of output.” “Elon Musk spent months slashing federal contracts—Now his AI company is celebrating a $200M Pentagon contract and new unit to get government business” is a new Fortune report by Jessica Mathews. Elon Musk’s xAI, a two-year-old AI company, said in a blog post Monday that it has launched a new division, called “Grok with Government,” and signed a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense, Mathews writes. xAI also announced that it had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products will now be available for purchase across every government office and agency.

Title: Texas officials defend flood response and Tucker Carlson criticizes Trump: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Republican strategists want lawmakers to get specific when selling the “big, beautiful bill” to voters. State and local officials defend their response to the catastrophic floods in Central Texas. And Tucker Carlson explains why he’s pushing back against some of Trump’s recent decisions. Here’s what to know today. Now that Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is signed into law, it’s likely the president will continue to use the alliterative turn of phrase he coined in talking about the legislation. But those in his own party, as well as Democrats, know those superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the price of gas and groceries — so they’re setting out to explain what the bill means for daily life. Two Republican strategists said they’re advising lawmakers to use different titles — such as the “Working Family Tax Cuts” act or possibly the “Trump Working Family Tax Cuts” — when referring to the legislation. The aim is to allude to policies, like no taxes on tips or overtime, that were popular among Trump voters. They’re also advising lawmakers to tout the additional money going to states for border enforcement. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day.

For example, Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation’s air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act. Trump, however, isn’t planning to traverse the nation to pitch the bill to voters. Instead, it’ll fall largely on his administration. An early test comes tomorrow, when Vice President JD Vance gives a speech at a machine shop in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to highlight how the bill “helps working class people most of all,” a person familiar with the speech said. Democrats, meanwhile, are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn. At stake is control of Congress, which is up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections.

Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, Kerr County Commissioner Jeff Holt and state Rep. Wes Virdell told NBC News over the weekend that officials did their best to coordinate evacuations and rescues against uncontrollable forces of nature. "Our teams did everything they possibly could with this gruesome, devastating situation that happened, and we would not change the way we did that. And I think we saved as many people as we could," Rice said. However, the officials noted that a permanent emergency operations center, more diversion dams and better cellphone service in certain areas might save lives in future floods. At least 132 people have died after the Guadalupe River surged to unprecedented heights in the early morning of July 4. More than 160 people are still missing. Kerr County and Kerrville officials held separate meetings yesterday about the ongoing flood response, though they mostly steered clear of addressing speculation over how leaders communicated about the floods.

A study of more than 1.2 million people found that there is no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. The study, published yesterday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, used Denmark’s nationwide registry to study people born between 1997 and 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared to those who received less. The study looked for connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions and five neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD. Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said on a 2024 podcast that aluminum in vaccines is “extremely neurotoxic.” Read the full story here. NBC News' politics team has been closely tracking MAGA influencers raising the alarm about some the moves by President Donald Trump and his administration — whether that means bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, floating a deportation carve-out for undocumented farm workers or shutting down the release of additional information on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. No one’s pushback garnered more curiosity, though, than Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host-turned-"America First" thought leader who was gifted a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last summer. Carlson had been aligned closely with the president after both men found themselves in exile after Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 election. I was able to get Carlson on the phone and ask about what’s been driving his recent criticism. “I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson told me last week, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.” Carlson spoke with me at a key moment for MAGA that is testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump, the man who brought the movement together, can shift its direction. If any of these influencers can play a role in shaping Trump's right-wing alliance, it's Carlson. — Allan Smith, politics reporter Want to perfectly block out other sounds or run with perfectly balanced audio?

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Jensen Huang is not an AI doomer, but he said developing tech could cause job losses if humans can’t come up with new ideas. As CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker now worth $4 trillion, Huang has a unique insight on the acceleration of AI adoption, and most of what he sees is positive. While some AI critics have warned the technology will lead to mass layoffs, Huang said it’s not likely. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” Huang told CNN. Just take a look at history: over the hundreds of years past as technology advanced, productivity gains went hand-in-hand with employment gains, said Huang. “Over the course of the last 300 years, 100 years, 60 years, even, in the era of computers, not only did productivity go up, employment also went up,” he said. “Now the reason for that is if we have an abundance of ideas, ways that we could build a better future, if we were more productive, we could realize that better.” The development of AI could also help humans by helping to surface new ideas across industries. The possibility of adding AI-enabled robots to fill the 30- to 40-million worker gap in skilled labor could also be positive and could help industry and the economy grow. Yet, without new ventures and ideas, the future looks more bleak, he said. “If you have no more ideas and all you want to do is this, then productivity drives down. It results in job loss.” Huang’s comments stand in stark contrast to those of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who said AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white collar jobs and spike unemployment by double digits over the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also warned AI will reduce the company’s total corporate workforce. Huang stands out as one of the more optimistic leaders in the AI space, although he noted that AI will certainly transform all jobs, and has already changed his own responsibilities. Although, he cheekily noted, he is still doing the job. Rather than fully replace humans, AI is already supercharging their productivity by equalizing the playing field, and hopefully, the productivity gains lift society, he added. “AI empowers people, it lifts people, it closes the gap, the technology gap, and as a result more and more people are going to be able to do more things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The official menopause wiki for Lemmy's c/menopause community, and its Reddit siblings, r/menopause and r/perimenopause. The following information is intended for educational purposes only, to provide a basis on which to further explore with your doctors. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Find a menopause practitioner at the following menopause societies or check our Menopause Provider Directory for more Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural biological process, experienced by half the population. Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first.

According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.

Title: Apple’s C-suite undergoes major reshuffle — here’s what it means for CEO Tim Cook

Apple has quietly undergone a major restructuring of its management team that has sparked speculation about the future of the world’s third most valuable company — but CEO Tim Cook isn’t going anywhere. Even as the iPhone maker faces mounting challenges — from AI stumbles to fading product innovation — the 64-year-old chief executive retains firm control of the company founded by Steve Jobs, even as most of his direct reports are nearing retirement age. And with longtime lieutenant Jeff Williams set to retire later this year, Cook’s leadership appears more entrenched than ever, according to Bloomberg News. Williams, Cook’s most trusted deputy, will exit in December. Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, who is in his late 50s, is slated to assume the COO title. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri has been succeeded by Kevan Parekh, and longtime product executive Dan Riccio departed at the end of last year. The company is seeing its biggest management shake-up in decades. Nearly half of Cook’s approximately 20 direct reports are in their 60s and nearing retirement, including senior figures like marketing chief Greg Joswiak, App Store head Phil Schiller, environment executive Lisa Jackson and chip executive Johny Srouji. Cook, meanwhile, who turns 65 in November, has shown no signs of stepping down or preparing a successor. The departure of Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer and widely seen as Cook’s natural heir, leaves the company without a clear backup plan, Bloomberg News reported. It also reinforces Cook’s position as the indispensable figure guiding Apple through turbulent times. Williams was uniquely positioned as both COO and unofficial backup CEO. Khan, while assuming the title, lacks the breadth of experience and institutional knowledge to immediately step in as chief executive, according to Bloomberg News. The situation is drawing industrywide comparisons to other long-tenured corporate leaders like Disney’s Bob Iger and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, who have extended their influence well past traditional retirement age. For Cook, whose tenure as CEO began in 2011, the prospect of remaining at Apple’s helm for another five years is increasingly likely as there is little urgency from Apple’s board to initiate a transition, Bloomberg News reported. The directors — longtime allies including Arthur Levinson, Susan Wagner and Ronald Sugar — have largely deferred to Cook, who has delivered a staggering 1,500% increase in Apple’s stock price since succeeding Steve Jobs. Though shares are down 16% in 2025, Cook remains the board’s trusted operator during a period of technological and cultural flux. Under his watch, Apple expanded into China, launched successful new product lines like the Apple Watch and AirPods and transitioned into a subscription-driven business. These achievements, however, are being challenged by Apple’s growing design stagnation, lagging AI performance and mounting criticism from developers and regulators. While rivals like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI rolled out advanced AI capabilities early, Apple is seen as trailing far behind. Its flagship initiative, “Apple Intelligence,” launched significantly later than competing products and still lacks several features that were promised during its 2024 debut. Still, there is no indication that the board is losing confidence, according to Bloomberg News. Inside Apple, Services head Eddy Cue has reportedly warned that the company risks becoming “the next BlackBerry or Nokia” if it fails to pivot quickly. Those concerns, coupled with the AI backlash, have prompted a reorganization of the org chart and the beginnings of a strategic reset. In order to right the ship, some have floated acquiring a top-tier AI startup and grooming its CEO for the top job. But insiders dismiss that possibility outright. Apple has reportedly explored acquisitions of companies like Perplexity and is considering Mistral, highlighting its increasing urgency in the AI arms race. The recent loss of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s foundation models chief, to Meta in a deal reportedly worth more than $200 million, only underscores the stakes. Despite the leadership uncertainty, Apple has a slate of new products on the way, including updated iPhones, iPads and a refreshed Vision Pro headset. But the changes are largely incremental — spec bumps rather than groundbreaking innovation, according to Bloomberg News. In the absence of revolutionary hardware or AI breakthroughs, the question of Cook’s eventual exit– and what comes after — continues to loom over Cupertino. For now, however, the CEO remains firmly in charge. And with no clear successor in place, the company’s future is still very much Cook’s to shape. The Post has sought comment from Apple.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury trend-setter, Strategy, has resumed its relentless quest for accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) after a brief pause during the first week of this month. The company added another 4,225 Bitcoins to its treasury in the last week as the price of Bitcoin soared to new all-time highs. Strategy now holds over 600,000 BTC, further solidifying its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), disclosed in a Monday 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had snagged an additional 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin between July 7 and July 14. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC acquired for $42.87 billion at an average price of $71,268 per Bitcoin. At the alpha crypto’s current market price of around $121,795, the company’s BTC stack is valued at over $73 billion. That’s equivalent to nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Strategy has acquired 4,225 BTC for ~$472.5 million at ~$111,827 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.2% YTD 2025. As of 7/13/2025, we hodl 601,550 $BTC acquired for ~$42.87 billion at ~$71,268 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/HhlFIy1m3H The latest acquisition was made using $331 million of net proceeds from sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, under its at-the-market (ATM) program, $71.1 million from STRK preferred shares, $55.3 million from STRF preferred shares, and $15.0 million from STRD preferred shares. These sales collectively yielded $472 million in net proceeds to fund Strategy’s BTC purchase. Strategy’s recent Bitcoin buy comes amid Bitcoin setting a record high above $112,000 last Wednesday. After beginning the week hovering around $108K, the BTC price rocketed to $118,000 highs by July 13. The world’s oldest and largest crypto has continued its parabolic surge today, setting a new all-time high of $122,838, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. As Bitcoin registered its strong upsurge, Saylor has continued voicing his uber-bullish sentiment on the X platform. “It’s going up forever, Laura,” the Strategy co-founder asserted while responding to Unchained’s founder, Laura Shin, who had commented about BTC smashing the $119K mark on Sunday. It's going up forever, Laura. Strategy’s Bitcoin investment comes as a growing number of public companies and other entities have disclosed new Bitcoin acquisitions. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, there are now 141 publicly traded firms that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a bid to emulate Strategy, which started snapping up the asset under the leadership of Michael Saylor back in 2020. Metaplanet, which touts itself as the “Strategy of Japan”, recently raised its Bitcoin stash to 15,555 BTC, worth over $1.7 billion. Semler Scientific, Trump Media, and GameStop are among other companies that have recently announced Bitcoin acquisition plans.

Title: Google Stock To $350?

Time Published: 2025-07-14T13:03:59Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 10 July 2025, Berlin: The Google logo can be seen on a small door at the stable guard party. Photo: ... More Jens Kalaene/dpa (Photo by Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) Google stock has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $88 levels in early 2023 to approximately $180 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI and cloud computing– the main growth engine for Google. Google Cloud has shown strong performance, with an average revenue growth of 31% over the last three years. This positive trend is anticipated to continue, with sales expected to average over 20% annually for the next three years. The substantial demand for cloud computing services is primarily driven by the growing AI boom, as companies increasingly utilize Google Cloud to quickly implement and scale their AI projects. Additionally, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified Point is, Google has a lot going for it. It also happens to be part of Trefis HQ portfolio strategy that has about 30 stocks. HQ has outperformed S&P and returned >90% since inception. Consider: how much of Google stock is in your retirement portfolio? Talk to an adviser if you’d like to learn about HQ strategy or to see if Google should be part of your portfolio. For Google stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: The convergence of these elements, particularly the AI revolution and growth in cloud computing, opens multiple avenues for Google to meet the performance required to double its stock price over the next 3-5 years. We anticipate Google’s revenues to surpass $500 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double due to improved profitability. Currently, GOOG stock trades around $180, pricing it at roughly 20 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 36 times and Microsoft at 39 times earnings. Given Google’s deep integration of AI and its enhancing profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Alphabet's Valuation Ratios Comparison. Google’s leading position in search, its dominance in digital advertising, and its expanding presence in cloud computing and AI infrastructure offer multiple levers for long-term value creation. This revaluation, supported by accelerating growth in high-margin segments like Google Cloud and YouTube, underpins the potential for the stock to double as markets reassess Alphabet’s earnings potential in an AI-driven economy. Alphabet’s core advertising operations, combined with strategic investments in AI, cloud services, and autonomous technologies, create a well-diversified and resilient growth engine. If these sectors maintain their current trajectory, the stock could see significant upside, driven by both revenue growth and improving operating leverage. While Google’s outlook is promising, several variables could hinder its stock from doubling. Firstly, escalating competition in critical sectors presents a threat. In cloud computing, Google Cloud faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which could pressure its margins and growth rates. Also see – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Likewise, in the rapidly advancing AI sector, rivals such as OpenAI (with ChatGPT) and Perplexity are challenging Google’s dominance in search through AI-driven methods. Secondly, regulatory scrutiny and antitrust actions are considerable concerns. Google is already confronting legal challenges regarding its market dominance in online search and digital advertising. Ongoing probes, including a recent preliminary investigation into its collaboration with Character.AI, underscore a growing regulatory interest in potential anti-competitive behavior, particularly in the emerging AI ecosystem. These developments could restrict expansion, result in hefty fines, or even compel business restructuring. Related – Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit Thirdly, Google’s substantial AI capital expenditures carry execution risks. The company plans to invest around $75 billion in technical infrastructure in 2025 to bolster AI and business growth. If these significant investments do not yield anticipated returns or take excessively long to materialize, investor sentiment may turn unfavorable. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Google’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its search and YouTube platforms, as well as enterprise cloud spending. For more details, see – Buy or Sell GOOG Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like Google less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Investors contemplating Google stock should carefully evaluate these potential risks. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, comprising 30 stocks, has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Most Companies Pick Layoffs. Here’s Why They’re Wrong.

ByRoberta Matuson ByRoberta Matuson, Contributor. The long-term impact of company-wide layoffs Major companies are picking layoffs in the name of efficiency—but is it really making them better? Another day, another layoff announcement. Layoffs are surging across industries, with firms like JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and Amazon making headlines for workforce reductions. Just last month, Microsoft announced plans to cut thousands more employees. Corporate America believes a leaner workforce equals quicker growth, but what are the real consequences? When the economy is in flux, companies tend to take the standard approach of slashing headcount, automating roles, and consolidating team. They do this to achieve immediate cost savings, streamlined operations, and to satisfy their investors. This approach may look good on paper, but is this method effective in the long run? No doubt, a massive layoff can result in dollars being added to the bottom line, but at what cost? Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise: Remember how long it took you to bring new hires up to speed and to train them on your systems? The money and time spent will be gone the moment the laid off employee walks out the door, as will the knowledge. This can severely disrupt operations and hinder innovation. Increased Employee Burnout and Decreased Engagement: Workers are already showing signs of employee burnout. Can you afford to ask your people to do more with less resources? Lower morale leads to reduced engagement, which may very well result in higher voluntary turnover—especially among top performers. Decline in Customer Satisfaction and Damage to Your Brand: Reducing headcount can result in slower service, lower quality, more errors, diminished customer trust, ultimately harming the company’s reputation and bottom line. Is your company brand strong enough to survive dips in quality and unflattering social media posts? Legal and Financial Risks: Layoffs can expose companies to legal challenges, such as wrongful termination claims, and may result in significant severance packages being paid out, along with unexpected legal costs. Do you have enough money in your coffers to budget for this? There are better ways than a layoff to boost efficiency. Here are some effective strategies worth further consideration. Focus on Skills, Not Just Headcount: Examine the skills your staff currently has and redeploy talent rather than cut jobs. Let Non-Performers Go: Terminate them, rather than covering this move up by using a layoff to rid your organization of dead weight. Invest in People: Help them reskill and upskill so they can be more productive for your organization. Offer Flexible Work Arrangements: Some workers may jump at the chance to work a reduced workweek or to job share. Offer Voluntary Buyouts and Early Retirement. Provide incentives for employees to leave voluntarily. Reducing headcount this way will be more favorably perceived by remaining staff than a layoff. Develop New Income Streams: It’s said that necessity is the mother of invention. Look for new opportunities to expand your revenues. Although it may be tempting to follow the latest trend of company-wide layoffs, think twice before taking your next step. By proactively implementing these strategies, organizations can navigate through economic upheaval with minimal disruption to their workforce and emerge stronger for the future.

US Stock futures slide as President Donald Trump announces 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, set to begin August 1, raising fresh concerns over trade tensions. While markets dipped early, they rebounded slightly as investors hoped the tariffs would be negotiated down. Traders are also focused on this week’s second-quarter earnings reports from big banks like JPMorgan and upcoming inflation data, both of which could impact sentiment. Meanwhile, Trump’s growing rift with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adds pressure to markets already on edge. Also, Bitcoin hits another record, and Tesla eyes a potential xAI investment vote.

Title: Meta trial becomes test of board culpability over corporate scandals

Meta luminaries will publicly testify in a Delaware corporate law court this week over shareholder allegations that board mismanagement was directly responsible for billions in sanctions that the social media group paid over data breaches. Two of Facebook parent company’s best known executives, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, are listed as witnesses in the eight-day trial, which starts on Wednesday. Long-time director and investor Marc Andreessen, as well as former board members Jeff Zients, a former top adviser to former US president Joe Biden, are also set to appear. Other director defendants include the investor Peter Thiel, Kenneth Chenault, the former American Express chief executive and Reed Hastings, the Netflix co-founder. The lawsuit, brought by three tiny minority Meta shareholders, is the first time a complaint over a board’s culpability for a corporate scandal has reached a trial in Delaware, where most such lawsuits are quickly dismissed. In a handful of instances, companies have settled litigation over board oversight charges, most notably the directors of Boeing who agreed to pay $237.5 million (€203 million) over shareholder charges that the highest levels at the aviation titan failed to prevent the 737 Max scandal. In the lawsuit, the shareholders accuse Meta’s directors of knowingly overseeing lax privacy practices, in violation of a 2012 consent decree struck with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) designed to protect users’ personal information – claims that the defendants reject. The FTC later launched an investigation into Facebook’s parent triggered in particular by the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which user data was leaked to a political research group through a third-party app. The suing shareholders have asked for damages stemming from the $5 billion settlement struck with the FTC in 2019 following the investigation. According to the plaintiffs, the board “protected” Zuckerberg by approving the price tag without any internal investigation, in return for the FTC agreeing to drop his name as an individual defendant in the case. Plaintiffs also allege that the founder “unlawfully sold billions of dollars of Meta stock because of the material non-public information (“MNPI”) he had regarding the company’s illicit, undisclosed data sharing practices”. [ Meta wins AI copyright case in blow to authorsOpens in new window ] Meta declined to comment on the case. In court filings, the defendants argue that the social media company’s directors did not knowingly violate the 2012 consent order, and that the board’s decision-making was prudent and not conflicted. Meta faces continued regulatory and legal scrutiny over issues including privacy and antitrust. Critics have argued that its aggressive hunt for growth and profits as a younger company led to online harms, with the company accused of amplifying hate speech and misinformation to juice engagement, or having poor data management practices. More recently, it has poured billions of dollars into trying to become a leader in artificial intelligence. “The allegations are significant in terms of who knew what and when during their largest scandal that they’ve had as a company,” said Jason Kint, a Big Tech critic who leads the Digital Content Next trade group of online publishers. “What’s at stake is the trust of the company – not just for the users but for the shareholders.” Shareholder lawsuits alleging poor board oversight have become known as “Caremark” claims, named for the healthcare company whose shareholders alleged corporate law liability over criminal fraud charges in the 1990s at the healthcare company. [ Meta introduces advertising to WhatsApp in push for new revenuesOpens in new window ] Scholars and judges have long been sceptical that wrongdoing stemming from business operations far removed from the boardroom could be pinned on the offending company’s directors. Directors can also offer a defence that pushing the boundaries of the law is consistent with maximising shareholder value. In the case of Meta, its market capitalisation has soared to nearly $2tn. “Increasingly there is a view that other regulators are not robustly doing their job and only corporate law and securities law can bail out victims,” said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. Meta notes in its court briefs that Delaware judges have previously remarked that a Caremark claim “is possibly the most difficult theory upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment” and that Meta’s “evidence will show that Facebook implemented a robust system of privacy controls” after the 2012 FTC consent decree. [ European Union risks becoming the ‘museum of the world’, says Meta privacy chiefOpens in new window ] The company has, however, already faced setbacks. The core Caremark claim from the plaintiffs has already survived Meta’s motion to dismiss. Separately, the court earlier this year granted sanctions against Sandberg, who left her executive role in 2022 and the Meta board in 2024, for deleting email messages from her Gmail account after being put on notice about the lawsuit. Last week, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said it would move its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, citing “recent actions by the [Delaware] Court of Chancery, which have injected an unprecedented level of subjectivity into judicial decisions, undermining the court’s reputation for unbiased expertise”. The Financial Times has previously reported that Meta has pondered moving its incorporation out of Delaware, the state that has traditionally dominated incorporations by both public and private companies. Technology companies have been spooked by the 2024 decision by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to rescind a $55 billion pay deal that Tesla had previously struck with its chief executive, Elon Musk. That case will soon be heard on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court. Chancellor McCormick is the judge who will now oversee the Facebook trial. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X prices may have leaked — and if true, it's not as bad as I thought
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-prices-may-have-leaked
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:00:48Z
Full Content:
Microsoft and ASUS are gearing up to launch the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld later this year, and the biggest questions remain fixed on price. Do we have our first answer? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few weeks ago, we exclusively leaked the Xbox Ally, codenamed Kennan, in development with ASUS ROG. The Xbox Ally range is powered by Z2 APUs, including the first handheld that will sport the Z2 Extreme on the high-end. These devices will have a heavily customized Windows 11 experience, complete with the first iterations of boot-to-full-screen-app capabilities. The new Xbox app will handle multi-tasking and other system features with an interface more intuitive for controller use, while also likely being the most powerful gaming handheld in existence. Given that last fact, people are expecting the Xbox Ally to also have a powerful price tag. There have already been some rumors about its price range flying around, from anywhere between $800 to over $1000 dollars. A new report from 3DJuegos (via IG) may have given us the first glance, leaked by ASUS itself. And honestly, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Although these prices may still just be place holders or some weird quirk of Google's new AI-"enhanced" search algorithms, Google Search store meta data scraped from ASUS' website, seemingly, suggests that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will closely match their predecessor's retail price, at least in Europe. For comparison, the previous Z1 Extreme ASUS ROG Ally X is currently also €899 in Europe at RRP, although it's currently on sale for $100 off on Amazon Germany. ASUS and other hardware retailers rarely do 1:1 price conversions on devices like this. At the current exchange rate, an €899 euro ASUS ROG Ally X would come in at $1050 US if that were the case. Instead, the ASUS ROG Ally X typically sports a $799 RRP in the United States, although some US retailers like Best Buy have it at $899 right now, likely due to stock limitations. Indeed, purchasing power, VAT, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and other factors go towards deciding the finalized price. Flat currency conversions are not how prices are decided, so take analyses making such claims with a huge pinch of salt. Given the constant evolution of the tariff situations emanating from the United States, you can bet that ASUS and Microsoft could wait until the last minute to finalize the price point. There is an event on the horizon that Microsoft typically prioritizes its PC announcements at, though, in the form of Gamescom in Germany, so it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for a formal announcement there. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Z1 Extreme regular ASUS ROG Ally is on sale for $649 in the United States, which is where these "leaked" prices potentially get a bit more interesting. The regular ASUS ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) is available to buy at around €699 in Europe and $649-ish in the United States, which would put the base model Xbox Ally around €100 cheaper than its higher-end predecessor. This could be a reflection of the power disparity. The lower-end ASUS ROG Ally is listed as $499 on ASUS' website, for reference. The Z2 "A" chip in the base model Xbox Ally is thought to not be as powerful as the Z1 Extreme in the previous ASUS ROG Ally on paper. It's specifically designed to be more cost-effective and potentially more battery efficient. The Xbox Ally X Z2 Extreme will be the crown jewel of gaming handhelds, though, and the price point will reflect that. Model Configuration Price (USD) ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1 / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $499 ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1E / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $649 ASUS ROG Ally X (2024) Z1E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $799 Xbox Ally (2025) Z2A / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $599 (Estimated) Xbox Ally X (2025) Z2E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $899 (Estimated) There has been speculation as to whether or not Microsoft would subsidize these devices, since it will be front-loading its Xbox PC store on them. I'd say that, increasingly, the era of subsidized "console" hardware is going to be a thing of the past, as players increasingly flock to PC and third-party software sales continue to be a smaller part of Microsoft's overall business. The Xbox Ally range are going to be Windows 11 gaming PCs in essence, meaning that you could buy one and never spend a penny on Microsoft's gaming ecosystem. It wouldn't make sense for Microsoft to subsidize it from their perspective. Either way, this could be our first real glimpse at the ASUS Xbox Ally price points. I would expect the United States price points to match the sticker price, rather than do a simple currency conversion. As such, I wouldn't be surprised if the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X come in at around $599 and $899 respectively, if these EU leaked prices are indeed accurate. It would closely match our previous predictions on the Xbox Ally price. But we won't know for sure until ASUS and Microsoft reveal it at their end. Better get saving, either way.

Title: You Have No Idea How Furious the Canadians Are

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In May, I reoriented my algorithms to flood me with Canadian content, turned on push notifications from The Globe and Mail, and temporarily moved my family north of the border. For months, Donald Trump had been casually threatening to annex Canada and turn it into a state, adding insult to the injury of the trade war he was waging on the country. One prime minister resigned amid Trump’s bullying, and another was elected because voters thought he could stand up to him. In the ordinarily placid provinces, feelings of bewilderment, anxiety, and offense hardened into a defiant resolve against the United States. “Elbows up,” went the nation’s new hockey-inspired mantra. As a Montreal journalist told me, Americans were preoccupied with “12 different crises.” In Canada, this was the crisis. Anti-American resistance was visible as soon as I landed. At a news kiosk at Toronto Pearson International Airport, the cover of Maclean’s, the de facto national magazine, teased “20 Reasons to Eat Canadian.” Inside was a letter from the editor about canceling a vacation to Cape Cod. This was mild compared with the cover of its next issue, “The New Nationalism,” which contained articles about “Why Canada Will Never Be an American State,” “How to Fight Back Against Trump’s Tariffs,” and “Fear and Loathing in a Canadian Border Town.” The publication had a new promotional campaign: “Canada’s Not for Sale. (But Maclean’s is.)” In grocery stores, Canada-affiliated products had been demarcated with red maple-leaf insignia — an official act of solidarity that complemented the consumer practice of flipping U.S. products upside down to make them easier to avoid. At a Loblaws, a woman wearing a leather jacket and AirPods was inspecting a jar of pomegranate marmalade to verify its country of origin. “I’m so disgusted by what’s going on down there. The most recent Harvard thing?” she said. “I shop on Amazon all the time — I recognize it’s an American company — I switched from buying stuff made in America to buying stuff made in China. And you know what? I’m okay with it.” She suggested I download an app called Maple Scan, which would tell me how Canadian a product was when I took a picture of it. (Canada Dry ginger ale, I learned, is owned by the American conglomerate Keurig Dr Pepper.) The app is just one of a crush of new tools that people up North are using to scrutinize the Canadianness of their purchases. Another one called TheCanadaList.ca was founded by a forensic-psychology professor at Ontario Tech University. He broke down his new habits in a newspaper interview: “I’ve switched from Oreos to Dare or Leclerc, from Nature Valley to MadeGood, from Lay’s to Hardbite, from Oikos to Liberté, from Tostitos to Mad Mexican.” The Buy Canadian phenomenon was even more pronounced on the alcohol front, as the country’s liquor stores are mostly government-run. Ontario Premier Doug Ford — brother of the late Rob Ford, the scandal-plagued Toronto mayor — halted the sale of American products by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, inspiring the other provinces to do the same. I drove to a Toronto LCBO to experience a liquor store with zero bottles of Tito’s Handmade vodka or Josh Cellars Merlot. Taped to the entrance were signs in French and English announcing the removal of U.S. products FOR THE GOOD OF CANADA. I was handed, and asked not to misplace, a laminated list of Canadian alternatives to popular American products. A clerk told me the U.S. booze was in the cellar aging indefinitely. Caught in the crossfire are blameless Canadian products that have an American stigma. For example: White Claw hard seltzer. “White Claw is a Canadian company that made itself huge down South,” Tyler VanderWallen, the general manager of Toronto’s Grizzly Bar, told me (“down South” is the U.S.). “If I sold White Claw here, I’d have to explain that to every third person, and I don’t want to have that fight.” Grizzly Bar is located on Toronto’s nightlife-heavy Queen Street West. A 14-foot inflatable moose guards its front door, and patrons are greeted by a motion-sensor-activated snippet of “O Canada” when they walk through it. The cocktails have names only Canadians understand, like “TVO Kids” and “Hadfield.” Everywhere, there is knowing Canadian kitsch: Canadian-side Niagara Falls projected onto a wall; a Wall of Heroes featuring framed photos of Ryan Reynolds, Leonard Cohen, Shania Twain, Margaret Atwood, Alex Trebek, and 46 others; a map of the key battles of the War of 1812. The bar is owned by a Vancouver video-game designer and his wife, who like to change its theme regularly, “like a piece of code.” When Trump ramped up his attacks, switching to a rabidly pro-Canada décor was the obvious move. The establishment was now under extra pressure to present a wholly Canadian front, from food ingredients to playlists. VanderWallen has started sourcing limes from Mexico instead of the U.S., even though they cost him around 20 cents more apiece. He said he still buys Heinz ketchup “because there’s a Heinz branch in Canada that is promising me I am getting 95 percent Canadian tomatoes.” Other establishments became anti-American against their will. When I visited Badlands, a Toronto bourbon bar that opened three months before all the bourbon disappeared, the manager, Carolina Rodriguez, pointed to a shelf of whiskey bottles she hadn’t intended to stock: Crown Royal (Canadian), Johnnie Walker (Scottish), and Bushmills (Irish). Deprived of the authentic U.S. product, Badlands rebranded as an all-purpose “country” bar. “My favorite cocktail is a Paper Plane, and if you have to make it without bourbon, it is terrible,” Rodriguez confessed to me. When she feels a customer deserves it, she’ll pull from her dwindling stash of pre-Prohibition Jim Beam and make them a proper drink without revealing its key ingredient. The country’s political class has attempted to sever itself from the U.S. by reorienting the Canadian economy in an east-west rather than north-south direction. For example, Canada is knocking down interprovincial trade barriers that make it near impossible to order a bottle of gin from Winnipeg if you live across the country, in say, Halifax. But on an individual level, the most evident rupture has occurred with respect to travel. Southbound commerce and tourism, even to once-symbiotic border destinations, has fallen off a cliff. Horror stories circulating about aggressive U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents don’t help. Buffalo’s new “Buffalo Loves Canada” campaign is trying to entice Canadian visitors by raffling off a $500 gift certificate and by emphasizing its appreciation of Canadian brands. (“Looking at you, Tim Hortons, Swiss Chalet, and Labatt Blue!”) The director of New York’s Thousand Islands tourism bureau stopped showing American images to Canadians on social media “because that allowed for some of that negative sentiment to fester.” The unfavorable exchange rate had already dampened Canadian enthusiasm for the U.S. before Trump smothered it entirely, said Caroline Beteta, the half-Canadian president and CEO of Visit California, the state’s tourism agency. But now warm-weather American states were desperately trying to lure staycationing “snowbirds” back to the sunny regions that rely on their seasonal commerce. “The Canadian media didn’t really want to entertain interviews with us,” Beteta said. She and her team put together an ad spot to highlight connections between the two peoples: the California roll, invented by a chef from British Columbia; Napa’s Signorello Estate, owned by a Canadian. YouTube commenters found it unpersuasive. The snowbird deficit was especially pronounced in Florida, with travelers flocking to the Caribbean instead and Canadian airlines axing direct flights. Governor Ron DeSantis didn’t seem too worried about the 3.3 million Canadians who visited in 2024 not returning, though others in Florida were frantic. “We don’t have any emails; we don’t have any calls,” said Karine Martinez, the Miami-based executive director of the CanadaFlorida Chamber of Commerce. These kinds of casualties are all over the place: In May, Canada’s passport office announced it was cutting 800 jobs because of decreased demand for applications. I spoke to snowbirds who are not just boycotting the beach but have sold second homes. One tech investor who built a house north of Palm Beach a few years ago told me his American golf buddies started making 51st-state jokes: “The first time, it’s funny. The second time, okay. The third time, it’s becoming annoying.” The last straw was a guy in a pickup truck who saw his plates in a parking lot and told him to go back to Canada. This is no way to live, he recalled thinking. Dale Hajas, a retiree from Ontario, recently kissed good-bye to her Greater Tampa development, where she estimates one-fifth of the winter residents are Canadian. “I’ve written to every tourism outlet in the United States — and not very graciously, I swear — to tell them why I will never set foot” there again, she said. “I redacted and then sent out-of-date bank statements showing what we’ve spent in the U.S. over the years.” Edmundston, New Brunswick, sits directly across the border from Madawaska, Maine. Both communities are bilingual, and until this year, their historically Acadian roots bound them more to each other than to their respective nations. Now, Edmundston’s mayor, Eric Marquis, told me border tensions have ruined everything. Residents say they will never return to the U.S., even though everybody has family on both sides and Edmundstoners used to cross over all the time for cheaper gas. “We had to procure two new fire trucks this year,” Marquis said, and this time, they had to be Canadian made. “The first question posed by the city council was ‘Where do they come from?’” The rupture began in earnest last fall. After decades of ho-hum amity that had survived the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in his first term, Trump began to covetously talk about the “faucet” of Canadian river water he wished to divert to California. After the election, then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau traveled to Mar-a-Lago to try to calm Trump’s early trade-related belligerence. The visit backfired when Trump mused about annexation over dinner, then started referring to Trudeau as a mere “governor” on Truth Social. Deeply unpopular even before Trump started messing with him, Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Trump proceeded to air grievances about Canada’s stingy military spending and dairy-production quotas while calling into question the boundaries governing control of the Great Lakes and the 1908 treaty that established the 49th parallel as the border. The administration then applied a round of tariffs to Canada, allegedly to punish it for the fentanyl slipping in from the north. (From 2022 to 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 59 pounds of fentanyl from Canada, compared with 61,900 pounds from Mexico.) Trump’s top brass took up the cause too. FBI director Kash Patel declared on Fox News that 85 percent of “known or suspected” terrorists who entered the country last year came via Canada. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a library that straddles the border, hopping from Quebec to Vermont while chanting “51st state!” Through the early months of the year, the administration continued to threaten, delay, and apply more tariffs while others were struck down in court. Canada is now chiefly being hit with 50 percent duties on steel and aluminum and 25 percent on automobiles, categories from which it had theoretically won exemptions when it signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, a pact Trump called “the best trade deal ever made.” In April, Canada experienced a record trade deficit, driven by a double-digit decline in automobile exports. That month, the central banker and political novice Mark Carney led the underdog Liberals to an upset national victory, which the party owed to the electorate’s view that the once-favored Conservative Party could not credibly stand up to Trump. “Trump is trying to break us so he can own us,” Carney had argued on the campaign trail. Even if most Canadians didn’t deem it likely that Trump would literally invade, there was agreement that he was, for some reason, fixated on crippling them. Carney has since applied counter-tariffs on some $30 billion of U.S. goods, targeting red-state-manufactured products such as bowling balls and bullets. There is only so much pain a country nine times less populous than the United States can inflict, but Canada’s boycotts have started to have their intended effect. Not long after the alcohol ban was imposed, a Kentucky distiller reported he’d already lost $115,000 from canceled shipments to Canada. Every week brings new statistics documenting Canadian retrenchment. Car trips to the U.S.: down 38 percent. Flights: down 24 percent. Canadian web traffic to the home-listings site Redfin: down 26 percent. Thirty-four U.S. states count Canada as their largest export market. “Give us another chance,” said North Dakota Republican Kevin Cramer, when a delegation of U.S. senators visited Ottawa to try and mend relations. In early May, Carney and Trump held a predictably surreal press conference in the Oval Office. Trump began genially, congratulating Carney on his election: “It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine.” But when a reporter asked if he still envisioned Canada as the 51st state, Trump killed the goodwill. “You know, I’m a real-estate developer at heart,” he said. The president waxed poetic about erasing “that artificially drawn line” on the map between the U.S. and Canada, saying that “when you look at that beautiful formation, when it’s together — I’m a very artistic person — but when I looked at that beauty, I said, ‘That’s the way it was meant to be.’” Carney interjected coolly, “Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We’re sitting in one right now.” Trump’s attacks galvanized Canadians because they had thought of their relationship with the U.S. as fraternal; the two countries share a language, cultural idioms, an undefended 5,525-mile border. When the Canadian journalist Paul Wells reluctantly severed his ties with the States this year, he wrote that it felt like an “amputation.” Yet the result of Canada’s withdrawal has been not just a mass “freedom fries” moment but a quest to redefine a national ethos distinct from American influence. Ten years ago, Trudeau told the New York Times his country had “no core identity” and had proudly set aside its cultural divisions to become “the first post-national state.” Now, Trump has given Trudeau’s own listless party an opening to reclaim a sense of patriotism, making Conservative pols feel like the victims of a stolen-valor campaign but uniting most everyone else around an invigorating shared project. When Scarborough, Ontario, native Mike Myers brandished a CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE T-shirt and mouthed “Elbows up” on Saturday Night Live — the phrase is associated with Red Wings legend Gordie Howe — he gave a name to the movement sweeping the country. In an ad spot for his bid for prime minister, Carney grilled Myers, a U.S. resident, to make sure he had retained his Canadian in-knowledge. (Carney: “What are the two seasons in Toronto?” Myers: “Winter and construction.”) Celebrity affiliation cuts the other way, too. In June, Jagmeet Singh, the former leader of the progressive New Democratic Party, was spotted attending a Kendrick Lamar concert, which was arguably disloyal to Lamar’s rival, Drake, even in peacetime. The Toronto rapper called him out, and Singh groveled for forgiveness, claiming he had been there only to see the other headliner, SZA. Also, wine from the estate that produces Wayne Gretzky’s line has become an exception to the Buy Canadian rule. Once a national hero, Gretzky is now persona non grata for his friendship with Trump. A guy offering tastings at a kiosk told me he places Gretzky’s wine as far from the customer eyeline as possible. One of the surest signs of the national mood shift is that even in Quebec, the independence-minded, Anglo-skeptical electorate is reporting unprecedented surges of Canadian patriotism. The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, has dismissed the rest of Canada as “an artificial country.” Yet many Québécois have swung toward the Liberals as a bulwark against Trump, and Blanchet understands the need to ally with them too. “This truce will last as long as we face the challenge imposed by Trump,” he told Maclean’s. Even the most anti-Canada Canadians I met couldn’t work themselves up for annexation. In Ottawa, I met Nicholas Ewanchuk outside the Canadian Parliament; he was flying a Trump flag, an American flag superimposed with an 18-wheeler, and an upside-down Canadian flag — the latter two symbols of the trucker convoy that blockaded Ottawa in 2022 in protest of COVID-19 restrictions. A Saskatchewan trucker fired for noncompliance, Ewanchuk had been protesting in Ottawa ever since. I asked if he was interested in joining the U.S. He winced, parrying the question. “You know, there never used to be a border. Back in the day, it was called Turtle Island,” he said, using an Indigenous term for the North American landmass. Canadian Star Trek legend William Shatner has been publicly workshopping a counterproposal to the U.S., summoning his Captain Kirk persona to engage in freelance diplomacy. “Canadians are very aware of the ka-ra-te adage ‘Use the opponent’s weight against them,’” Shatner told me from Los Angeles. “Canada should say to President Trump, ‘You are the head of a rambunctious country, very difficult to govern at this point. We can ease your pain. Canada is calm, settled, successful. Clean air, clean water, pleasant people. Why don’t you become the 11th province?’” Two days after I arrived in Canada, I caught a plane to Ottawa to get a glimpse of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Charles had come to the capital to deliver a highly anticipated address to the Canadian Parliament called a “Speech From the Throne,” the climax of a pomp-filled 24-hour visit plotted by the new prime minister as a symbolic rebuke to Trump. In the hours leading up to the speech, I followed the royals to events designed to showcase Canada’s heritage and natural bounty: a puck drop at a youth hockey game, a farmers’ market, a tree planting, a military parade, all of them thronged with people in maple-leaf and Union Jack gear. Rolling out the red carpet for one’s old colonial master may not seem like an obvious demonstration of national sovereignty, but it made sense in Canada: Since Trump has a thing for the royals, it was a flex that the nation, as a member of the Commonwealth, could summon its king on short notice, especially as Charles was undergoing treatments for cancer. Amid Trump’s confusing aggression, the visit would also underscore the country’s secure place in a wider global dominion. And contrary to the idea that the two nations were intuitively mergeable, a choreographed regal affair might accentuate certain proudly un-American aspects of Canada’s national character, such as the “peace, order, and good government” enshrined in its constitution. In the capital, the royal visit was treated as a national holiday. Even its most benign details were curated, or at least interpreted, to reflect the hostile new dynamic between Canada and its longtime ally to the south. On previous visits, for example, Charles had been chauffeured in an American-made Lincoln. This time, he rode in a BMW. A royal historian named Justin Vovk insisted to the CBC that even Charles’s planting of a single tree would “take on added symbolism,” given Trump’s rhetoric about Canada’s natural resources. Waiting for the royals to show up at the farmers’ market, I chatted up well-wishers pressed against a security perimeter. A woman named Lucia Velasco told me she saw Charles as a stabilizing force in wartime. “And right now we are not at war, but …,” she said, trailing off. Debbie Guiry, standing nearby and wearing a Union Jack umbrella hat, finished the thought: “It feels like it.” The night before the “Speech From the Throne,” I met Liam Mooney at the Rideau Club, an elite gathering spot established by two of Canada’s founding fathers. Mooney, who runs an Ottawa branding agency with his wife, created the now-famous CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE cap worn by Premier Ford, which has sold more than 50,000 units and inspired many knockoffs. A little sheepishly, Mooney told me, he has cried at just two celebrity deaths — those of NFL broadcaster John Madden and Queen Elizabeth II. In other words, some part of him could easily have been American, but another was not. In January, after Trudeau announced his resignation, Mooney said, “We had this weird problem where Canada doesn’t have a dad.” Today, he said, half-joking, “Granddad is here.” Over my weeks in Canada, I encountered a number of attempts to retrofit a cohesive identity onto a nation that can seem best defined by its agreeable pastiche of other nations’ influences. “Talking about the Canadian border or the 49th parallel like it’s an imaginary thing — it forces you to think, like, Okay, well, what is it that we’re about?” Mooney said. “Well, Canada’s bilingual. We are a peacekeeping nation. We are a winter nation. When it’s 30 below Celsius, you better have a good relationship with your neighbor” because it’s too cold to head into town for milk. Mooney repeated an adage I heard a lot: The country is a mosaic of peoples, rather than an assimilated, American-style melting pot. “We are a parliamentary democracy,” he said. “We were founded by these two crowns, the British and the French.” A Euro-style social democracy built on a foundation of Tory mildness, Canada can feel lab-designed for compromise and geniality. In The Globe and Mail, a writer described the nation as one of “satirists and folk singers, sage retired bureaucrats, and many, many farmers.” In Maclean’s, another writer compared Canada’s “long but imperfect history of muddling along peaceably” with America’s “unpredictable and increasingly dysfunctional empire.” All of which makes the new Canadian nationalism so striking. Despite Trump’s instigation of the conflict, there is an oddly abstract quality to U.S. bellicosity; even the president’s most loyal supporters may be only vaguely aware that the relationship with the country’s close trading partner and military ally has completely ruptured. Whereas in Canada, where nobody had a problem in the first place, virtually the entire population is now charged up and doing bespoke economic protectionism. “In the U.S., there’s roughly 350 million people going on their way, la-di-da,” said Ford, the Ontario premier. “But there’s 41 million Canadians at a fever pitch right now doing everything they possibly can to support the cause. I’ve never seen patriotism like this.” The “Speech From the Throne” took place at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday. Normally a rote address used to open a new session of Parliament, the actual sovereign had only twice appeared in person to deliver it. And while the speech was written by the prime minister’s staff, even the subtlest anti-Trump jab ventriloquized by the monarch would be newsworthy. The country’s political class showed up in full, including vanquished Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. First Nations leaders from the prairie provinces arrived in traditional headdresses, and Trudeau caused a fuss by wearing turquoise-and-orange Adidas Gazelles with his suit. The king began by acknowledging the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people, then delivered his speech in French and English, alternating every few paragraphs. “When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,” read Charles in his familiar murmur. Sitting beside him was Camilla, wearing a maple-leaf brooch. Now, he continued, “Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.” The king spoke of self-determination and the rule of law and trade, rendering the target of his speech unmistakable. His closing line generated a rousing ovation: “As the anthem reminds us, the True North is indeed strong and free.” If the goal was to get Trump’s attention, it appeared to work. Later that day, he posted on Truth Social, “I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!” In my travels, I met a retired high-school history teacher named Peter Kear who loaned me his copy of a 1993 book called The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Canadian Resistance to American Expansionism. As an American typically unversed in Canadian history, I wondered if its title was maybe a bit hyperbolic. Then I opened the book to example after footnoted example of zealous American attempts to dominate Canada. “Come then, ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty,” General George Washington wrote to the Canadians in September 1775, announcing he had authorized a military invasion “not to plunder, but to protect you.” The British Empire had recently conquered Quebec and the rest of New France from Louis XV, and the Americans were trying to enlist the colony in their brewing revolution. Their entreaties failed, in part because of Britain’s shrewd passage of the 1774 Quebec Act, which allowed the province to maintain its Catholic religion. Washington launched a New Year’s Eve invasion of Quebec City that ended in miserable defeat and the capture of 372 of Colonel Benedict Arnold’s 500 troops. America was undeterred. “The unanimous voice of the Continent is that Canada must be ours,” insisted John Adams, then a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. In the winter of 1776, Benjamin Franklin was sent north on a diplomatic mission to tout the U.S. cause, which also failed. After the Americans won the Revolutionary War, tens of thousands of Tory “United Empire Loyalists” fled to Canada, massively increasing its English-speaking population and arguably seeding the temperamental divide between tranquil Canada and its more ardent neighbor to the south. In 1812, President James Madison declared war and invaded Canada again; Speaker of the House Henry Clay said, “I would take the whole continent from them.” (The war is generally considered a draw, but I was made to understand that British Canada and its Shawnee allies should be seen as the victors because the invading Americans gained no territory while their opponents burned down the White House.) In 1844, James K. Polk won the presidency on the strength of the “54-40 or Fight” campaign to claim northwestern land clear to Alaska, up through present-day British Columbia. From the Canadian perspective, the movement to confederate the country’s provinces into a single nation was driven partly by the need to resist American expansion, which Canadians feared would spread northward after the military buildup of the Civil War. “They coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted Louisiana, and they purchased it; they coveted Texas, and stole it,” said Thomas D’Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation who had moved from the U.S. to escape its “diseased love of excitement.” McGee was allegedly murdered by a member of an Irish separatist group that attacked Canada with the possible blessing of President Andrew Johnson. Even after Britain granted Canada the right to self-governance, in 1867, the U.S. continued to wage economic warfare in an attempt to bring the young country to its knees. In 1888, Secretary of State James Blaine wrote that, like a ripe apple, Canada would “fall into our hands” and “seek admission to the Union” if the U.S. bludgeoned it with the heavy import duties that became known as the McKinley -Tariff, named for Trump’s favorite protectionist. (There have also been Canadian pro-annexationists, including the composer of “O Canada,” of all people, who in the 1880s became embittered with his country and moved to Massachusetts.) Relations improved vastly in the 20th century, but even in the 1980s, vestigial anxiety about American imperialism was such that many felt free trade, not protectionism, was the thing that would finally KO Canada’s sovereignty. The 1988 Liberal Party leader John Turner argued the trade pact that preceded NAFTA would reduce the country “to a colony of the United States” dependent on the impulses of its corporations. Turner lost that year’s election, but a million more Canadians voted for the anti-free-trade candidates than against them. (The author of my talismanic new history book, David Orchard, was one of the leaders of the movement.) So a student of Canadian history might not have been surprised at a renewed bout of U.S. encroachment, nor the Canadian response to it. “The U.S. always seems to think, If we can threaten you economically, you’ll just come and join us,” says Christopher Sands, an expert on U.S.-Canada relations. Sands used to direct the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, until, tellingly, the Wilson Center was dismantled by DOGE. “It has never worked. It only ever builds up a certain Canadian nationalistic response,” he said. Of course, not every single last Canadian is living life at a nonstop anti-U.S. fever pitch. Though nobody wants to be annexed, there tends to be an older-white-liberal bent to the most fervent of the new patriots, as at a “No Kings” rally. The cause may feel less urgent for oil-and-gas libertarians in Alberta, which is home to a growing separatist movement, or in the immigrant enclaves of the Toronto suburbs that voted Conservative in the recent election, where people were focused on housing costs and quality-of-life issues. Some demographics are bound to find the rah-rah a little embarrassing. “Elbows up, or whatever,” wrote Slate’s Toronto-based music critic Carl Wilson on his Substack, recommending some Canadian LPs for Canada Day. Others are fully catastrophizing. This past spring, Canadian author Stephen Marche war-gamed a potential conflict in The Atlantic. Given the large discrepancy in the size of the countries’ standing armies, he figured the Canadian military response would have to include civilian insurgency. “If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers,” he wrote, citing a combat expert. “Canadians cannot afford complacency.” Marche has an eight-part podcast out on the U.S. threat featuring an image of geese and eagles fighting. The plot of Michael Moore’s 1995 movie Canadian Bacon is that a U.S. president gins up anti-Canadian hate to boost his approval rating, the running joke being, Who could possibly hate a Canadian? In South Park, Canadians are depicted as a malign, weird-looking species, and the townspeople hold them responsible for corrupting the youth. What pop culture treats as prima facie farcical, Trump is doing in real life: blaming Canada. His exact motivation remains opaque. Trade tensions flared in his first term, but there was no talk of water faucets and 51st states. Some theorize Trump enjoys trolling Trudeau and, even after his resignation, just never stopped. “He always saw Trudeau as a theater major,” said someone involved in the trade negotiations. Not all of Trump’s complaints are random. His grievances with Quebec’s protectionist dairy industry, which limits imports, were shared by the Biden administration. (Milk is the third rail of Canadian politics. Carney has already pledged not to touch it in trade negotiations, lest he lose Quebec’s support.) And especially now, you can find Canadians who agree with Trump that the country should ramp up its military-defense budget to meet NATO spending obligations, as Carney has pledged to do. When it comes to the president’s outré talking points, such as the location of the 49th parallel, observers of the conflict -suspect trade hawk and White House senior counselor Peter Navarro may be in his ear. In 2018, Navarro said there was a “special place in hell” for Trudeau during routine trade talks. This year, he reportedly proposed ejecting Canada from the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. (He denied the report.) When I texted Steve Bannon to ask what he thought of the new hostilities toward Canada, he replied, “LOVE IT.” But then, just a few months ago, Bannon struck a different tone in an interview with the Financial Times. “Canada punches way above their weight. If you look at military history, they’ve been the best ally we’ve had,” he said. Bannon didn’t pick up the phone when I tried to square the circle. “I’m not sure this has an intellectual underpinning, to be honest,” a former Trump-administration foreign-policy official told me. The tariffs themselves, should they stick, are likely to have mixed results. Canadians do fear they could decimate the auto industry. “We don’t really want cars from Canada,” Trump explained to Carney in May. “And at a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars.” That same month, General Motors announced it was eliminating a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant that makes Chevrolet Silverados, resulting in roughly 650 layoffs that will take place in the fall; GM is ramping up Silverado production in Indiana. But Canada’s inclusion in Trump’s aluminum tariffs has also generated puzzlement. The U.S. gets two-thirds of its aluminum from Canada, but those smelters are mostly powered by cheap Quebec hydroelectricity the U.S. probably can’t replicate. Sylvain Maltais, the head of the aluminum-workers union in the company town of Alma, told me that there had been no layoffs and that Rio Tinto, the mining giant that owns the plants, was proceeding with existing investments. “For the moment, it’s going well. There’s not a lot of stress,” Maltais said. In the U.S., however, the prices of seltzer and cat food — and anything else that comes in a can — are expected to rise. Even if a truce is reached to end the trade war, the national resistance against America will persist. As Trump continues to belittle and toy with Canada, its people have lost faith that its neighbor will treat it decently. At the start of the conflict, commenters tended to lump Trump’s attacks on Canada as of a piece with his designs on Greenland and the Panama Canal, all of it evidence of cartoonish saber-rattling. But as the rift deepened, Canadians began taking the imperialist threat seriously. Surveying the growing imbalance between the temperate Canadian climate and drought-stricken areas of the American West, an environmental journalist recently forecast, in the magazine The Walrus, a future in which Canada becomes a strip-mined “vassal state”: “As US aquifers go dry, the lakes will be a natural place to look.” On June 15, Trump arrived in Carney’s home province of Alberta for the Group of Seven Summit, where the Canadian media and political Establishment were cautiously optimistic that the conference might produce a new trade agreement. Would the countries patch things up? Instead, in a press conference, Trump blamed Barack Obama and Trudeau (who wasn’t in power at the time) for kicking Russia out of the then-G8 for its 2014 invasion of Crimea. Trump abruptly left the next day without any progress made on a deal, and Canadians felt had all over again. In July, seemingly out of the blue, Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on all Canadian goods, posting an open letter to Carney on social media in which he complained that Canada had “financially retaliated” against the U.S. and doubled down on the assertion that Canada fails “to stop the drugs from pouring” across the border. Carney responded on X: “We are committed to continuing to work with the United States.” But, he added, “we are building Canada strong” and “strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world.” Until his retirement from Parliament earlier this year, Charlie Angus represented a large swath of rural Ontario. A rabble-rouser who plays in an alt-country band called the Grievous Angels, Angus has remade himself as a de facto leader of the “Elbows up” movement, posting testimonials of everyday resistance on Substack and touring auditoriums across the country. The night after Trump’s G7 exit, I went to one of his events in Oshawa, the economically anxious General Motors town. Filling the theater was a mostly older crowd with a few union types mixed in. Angus launched heatedly into his one-man show. “They thought, Canada, wow, let’s go pick on the Canadians, right? I mean, what’s easier to pick on than Canadians? That’s what they thought. They thought we were pushovers. Now they’re learning,” he said. It used to be “we didn’t need a big national story. We didn’t need to be jingoistic because we had next-door neighbors who were super-loud. We just did our thing. And then suddenly, we have a government who says we don’t even have a right to exist as a nation. Overnight, something changed for every person in this country. You said, ‘Not on my watch,’ and you sat down at the kitchen table and said, ‘No, we’re not going back to Florida.’ And you called the hotel in Arizona and said, ‘I don’t care if we lose our deposit.’” If all this sounded like a civilized way to conduct a trade war, well, that only underscored the rift. It takes a special kind of belligerence to piss off the nicest people on the planet. With friends like us, who needs enemies? And if our enemies now include Canada, we probably don’t have any friends left at all. A couple of weeks before the show, Angus and I had met in Toronto at Grizzly Bar. “You think I’m going to let that fucking criminal take my country? Not a chance,” he said as we drank Canadian beers. “So suddenly we go from being really easygoing to a nation of hockey goons.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: 5 Challenges Facing New WPP CEO Cindy Rose

Time Published: 2025-07-14T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Incoming WPP CEO Cindy Rose has a big job ahead when she steps into the role in September. As the Microsoft exec takes the reins from Mark Read, who’s departing after seven years at the helm, she inherits a business in decline that’s struggling to keep pace with an industry in flux. In addition to addressing WPP’s structural and financial problems—it issued a shock profit warning and downgraded its 2025 growth forecast last week—Rose must stave off continued client losses and turn around morale at its agencies. Industry leaders agree that Rose has the AI and technology expertise needed to bring WPP into the future. But what’s most crucial is that she develops a clear vision for a business that’s lacked one for some time. “Hopefully the WPP board are clear about what its new strategy is, as the current one has not delivered,” said Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Studio.One and former CEO of WPP agency AKQA. As the leader of a public company, Rose will have to contend with shareholders impatient for WPP’s stock to bounce back from historic lows. This will be difficult in a sector that is “facing real pressure,” said Ahmed. “Interest rates are still high. Budgets are tight. Platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Google offer increasingly sophisticated ad tools that bypass agencies,” he said. “Consulting firms and independent agencies are winning share with a more attractive value proposition.” In that pressure cooker, Rose’s strategic decisions will, in large part, be dictated by the board’s end game: Does it want to create a real strategy for WPP’s future, or would it be better off selling the company for parts? “There’s the financial engineering side—what will produce the most value for shareholders independent of the right strategy?” said Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall. “Because the stock is so, so very low, it could very well be that the board would rather see some immediate benefits.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of S4 Capital and former CEO of WPP for three decades, said it comes down to whether the business “would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.” “Companies that were once part of WPP, such as Kantar, VCCP, FGS, and Globant have thrived as independent companies,” Ahmed pointed out. “The question is, could WPP realize the value in some of its assets before it’s too late, or does it want to merge and consolidate its agencies further internally?” If the board does want to pursue a future for WPP in this current state, Rose needs a clear strategy and point of view for the business—something observers agree has been lacking. “The big concern for shareholders and employees isn’t just the structure; it’s the absence of a clear, credible plan,” Ahmed said. “For a while now, it’s felt like WPP has been making it up as it goes along.” For Wieser, that challenge gets to the heart of an existential industry issue: “how do you organize a modern agency group, and what should the agency services industry look like?” While Read merged agencies under WPP to streamline its unwieldy operations, he hasn’t gone as far as his peers in operating the company as a single brand. Instead, he’s touted the importance of agency brands as levers for attracting clients and talent, Wieser said. But that approach has drawbacks for WPP, including adding “layers of non-billable overhead both at the central level and within the agencies,” as well as “tremendous duplication of services,” Ahmed said. “Ogilvy has become a holding company within a holding company, which isn’t exactly simplification.” Wieser agreed that agency mergers weren’t a real strategy. “That was desperation,” he said. “There’s a recognition these will be loss-making entities on their own, so let’s do the bare minimum.” Coming in as an industry outsider, Rose will have to quickly develop a point of view on the role of agency brands and identify the right structure to take WPP into the future. “Being both a holding company and a client-facing brand at the same time as managing dozens of agency brands with their individual cultures, leadership teams, and operations is confusing, and this model hasn’t worked for WPP,” Ahmed said. Under Read, WPP invested millions of dollars into WPP Open, its internal AI platform. It will be Rose’s job to make that bet pay off—and set WPP up for an AI-powered future. “The significant investment into WPP Open hasn’t yielded the growth that was hyped a couple of years ago,” Ahmed said. According to Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester, WPP chose a tech executive with an AI background for exactly that reason: “The selection of Rose is designed, in part, to further commercialize WPP Open,” he said. Ahmed agreed that Rose’s experience at Microsoft, which “hasn’t exactly been shy about reinventing themselves over the years,” will be useful in pushing WPP to adapt to automation. But whether that’s enough to transform the legacy holding company’s business model remains to be seen. “WPP is a services company, not a software company,” Pattisall agreed. “Modernizing WPP itself, as it reconciles with automation and change, will be no small task.” “I’m not convinced that agencies can build a SaaS-type business in competition with software companies like Adobe,” Sorrell added. Rose is taking over a business where morale is low and client relationships are tenuous. WPP has lost several major clients this year, including Mars and Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, ongoing layoffs and a botched return-to-work mandate have led to discontent and anxiety among staff. Sorrell pointed to what he views as a misguided simplification strategy under Read, which collapsed brands like J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, and Wunderman, as the reason WPP has lost “not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.” Nick Emery, CEO of agency Jellyfish and a former WPP Media exec, believes Rose’s biggest challenge will be to “fight for, protect, and champion the many brilliant people who’ve given their all to the company—and to craft a strategy that makes them happier, drives growth for clients, and fully embraces the role of AI to fulfill the promise of technology.” Rose’s attention here must be “24/7, laser-focused on the USA,” according to Sorrell, which is “undoubtedly the center of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralized.” “You have to hope—if you’re hoping for good things for WPP—that she’s an excellent manager,” Wieser added. “That’s probably the single most important issue.” Rose’s industry outsider status could be a challenge or benefit, depending who you ask. Ahmed described her as “a safe pair of hands” as “an internal candidate with an external vantage point.” Sorrell said she fits WPP board chairman Philip Jansen’s criteria as a technology and AI-forward executive. But Wieser pointed out that in addition to this being her first CEO gig, her only ad industry experience has been through the vantage point of sitting on WPP’s board. “You really haven’t actually lived and breathed the industry,” he said of Rose. “It’s plausible that your views on the industry might be incomplete.” However, he added, “it can also mean fresh eyes, which is not a bad thing at all,” pointing to Michael Roth’s successful tenure at IPG. What’s crucial is that Rose surrounds herself with executives that have “clarity of vision.” “It’s going to come down to good management,” he said.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as king of market milestones

Nvidia is the world’s first $4 trillion company, leaving Apple – long the king of market milestones – in its wake. Apple was the first to hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion. But while its market capitalisation ($3.15 trillion) has idled since first closing above that landmark in mid-2023, Nvidia’s has quadrupled, fuelled by insatiable demand for its AI chips. Even that understates Nvidia’s rise: the stock is up more than 1,000 per cent since early 2023. [ Nvidia outpaces Microsoft and Apple on path to $4 trillion valuationOpens in new window ] That sounds bubbly, but staggering revenue growth suggests otherwise. Revenues rose 69 per cent last quarter to $44 billion, with another record forecast for this one. Its top customers – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet – are to spend $350 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of it on Nvidia hardware. Valuation remains punchy, but not absurd. Nvidia’s price-sales ratio is nearly four times that of Apple’s, but the difference between their forward price-earnings ratios is slight. Nvidia bulls will note its growth rate is exponentially higher than Apple’s and its PEG ratio (which adjusts for earnings growth) is actually far lower. Apple is stable and cash-rich, but slow growth means it’s far from cheap. Nvidia appears riskier, but it keeps growing into its multiple. For now at least, investors are willing to pay up for speed over stability.

Rupee falls below 86 against USD due to foreign fund outflows and trade deal delay, impacted by global factors. Today, the Indian stock market closed in negative territory with the Nifty 50 ending at 25,082.45, down approximately 67 points or 0.27%, and the Sensex falling over 247 points. The decline was primarily driven by broad-based selling pressure in the IT sector, which acted as the key laggard. Major IT stocks such as Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) witnessed average declines of 1.5%, with TCS’s subdued quarterly earnings and cautious outlook weighing heavily on sentiment. Global cues also remained weak, with concerns over the ongoing trade war and anticipation of US inflation data contributing to cautious investor behavior. Despite the negative close, some pockets such as select banking and pharmaceutical stocks showed resilience, but their gains were insufficient to offset the broad market weakness. The market breadth was skewed towards declines, reflecting a risk-off sentiment among investors amid mixed earnings results and geopolitical uncertainties.

With the decline in inflation on food items being the major influence in this trend is a positive sign, especially for the household consumers and food services sector. The deflated trend observed in food items, along with other factors including the CPI performance, and the recent rate cut by the MPC has enhanced liquidity flow in the hands of the masses, thereby boosting domestic consumption, and empowering the businesses in the food services sector with some relief on the margins. We foresee this performance to sustain over a period of time, driven by cautious-but-steady steps of the RBI to keep the inflation within the desired range. Having said that, there is a need to be agile and stay vigilant on the global economic and commodity trends to ensure the ripple effect of the same doesn’t hamper the domestic momentum.

Markets under pressure, Sensex down 365.29 points to 82,135.18, Nifty down 101.55 points to 25,048.30. Indices extend losses.

Stock market plunges on weak corporate results and global trade fears, with Nifty IT down 1.54% and smallcaps outperforming. “The WPI surprisingly reverted to a year-on-year (YoY) deflation in June 2025 after a gap of 19 months, printing at -0.1% as against ICRA’s expectation of +0.8% for the month. This was largely led by prices of food items, which declined by 0.3% after witnessing an inflation of 1.7% in the previous month, amid softer prints for fruits and vegetables, pulses, cereals, spices, and edible oils. Among the non-food items, the deflation in fuel and power also widened between these months, exerting downward pressure on the headline print. Notably, the core WPI (non-food manufactured items) inflation inched up marginally to +1.0% in June 2025 from +0.9% in May 2025, while remaining subdued. The seasonal sequential uptick in food prices has been relatively modest in July 2025 so far, which is expected to keep food print in the deflationary zone, unless there is an unusual surge in such prices in the remaining part of the month, especially for vegetables. Besides, international crude oil prices have also eased somewhat in the ongoing month from the peak seen in June 2025, amid cooling tensions in West Asia, while remaining in the deflationary territory on a YoY basis. Further, the USD/INR pair has also remained range bound so far. Overall, ICRA expects the headline WPI to remain in the deflationary territory in July 2025 despite an unfavourable base, amid the sustained YoY deflation in food and crude oil prices. With the WPI inflation averaging at just 0.4% in Offers investors a unique opportunity to build long-term wealth Fund available at ₹10 Net Asset Value (NAV) during the New Fund Offer (NFO) subscription period commencing from July 14 Becomes the first life insurer to offer this fund to its customers As investors prepared for US trade-related developments, markets took a cautious approach last week. Following a brief decline below $3300, gold has recovered, and Silver has touched new record highs. Trump said on Tuesday that copper would probably be subject to a 50% tariff. Trump then reaffirmed his warning on Wednesday to impose additional tariffs on BRICS nations and released a fresh series of letters outlining duty rates of 20%–30% on smaller trading partners like the Philippines, Algeria, and Libya. In the meantime, the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting revealed that the majority of members projected a rate reduction later this year, with any tariff-related price increase being “temporary or modest.” Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced that an additional 10% tariffs would be applied to nations that align with the BRICS group, an intergovernmental organization made up of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa (founding members), India, China, Brazil, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Trump imposed a 30% tariff on both the EU and Mexico in letters to both countries, calling their trade deficits with the US a “major threat” to national security. Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1. Trump did, however, publish the letters they addressed to trading partners, revealing that they will be levying 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan. For more precise clues about the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, investors are keenly observing a number of important US economic releases this week, such as the CPI, PPI, retail sales, and industrial production.

Agri-gold lending guidelines revised RBI allowed voluntary pledge of gold and silver as collateral This is positive for PSU banks that rely on PSL certificate fee income Among PSU Banks, Union Bank, Canara Bank and Indian Bank have higher share of fee income from this business Bitcoin has rocketed to a fresh all-time high, surging past $121,000. Here’s the take of Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ, on this development: Bitcoin has smashed past $121,000, marking fresh all-time highs as institutional demand and policy tailwinds fuel the rally. The latest surge follows last week’s 10% rise, with over $289 million in short liquidations amplifying momentum. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.2 billion in inflows on Thursday and $1.03 billion Friday, pushing total U.S. ETF net inflows beyond $50 billion to date. The rally coincides with Congress’ “Crypto Week,” where lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and GENIUS Act, aiming to establish regulatory clarity and permanently block CBDCs. With Trump’s pro-crypto policies, regulatory easing, and macro uncertainty, Bitcoin’s case as a mainstream asset is rapidly solidifying.

While Trump has allowed room for negotiations until August 1, the potential for a rapid escalation has kept risk assets under pressure, prompting investors to seek safety in haven assets like gold. Looking ahead, inflation data due on Tuesday, along with a busy week of corporate earnings, will help shape gold’s near-term direction. However, the strength of the U.S. dollar, bolstered by these trade uncertainties, may limit further gains in the precious metal.” Anthem Biosciences Limited’s ₹3,395 crore initial public offering received a tepid response on its first day, with the issue subscribed only 0.19 times by midday Monday.

Source: Reuters Crude oil futures traded higher on Monday morning as markets awaited a ‘major announcement’ by US President Donald Trump on Russia. At 9.22 am on Monday, September Brent oil futures were at $70.50, up by 0.20 per cent, and August crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, up by 0.22 per cent. July crude oil futures were trading at ₹5899 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹5881, up by 0.31 per cent, and August futures were trading at ₹5797 against the previous close of ₹5779, up by 0.31 per cent. ● Total Income grew to ₹7,819.82 million, up 11.34% from ₹7,023.56 million in FY24, driven by higher daily dispatches, an expanded vendor base and greater wallet share from repeat customers. ● EBITDA rose to ₹579.75 million, up 345.3% YoY, with margin expansion of 561 basis points to 7.48%, supported by a strategic product mix shift, growing share of third-party manufactured products, expanding services and operational efficiency. ● PAT for FY25 was ₹60.13 million, compared to a loss of ₹172.98 million in FY24 reflecting a strong turnaround driven by scale, stronger margins and disciplined cost control, despite absorbing ₹73.73 million in IPO-related expenses. Shares up 1.69% on the NSE to ₹165.90 Morning Outlook – 14th July 2025 Indian benchmark indices are expected to open on a flat to slightly negative note today, as suggested by the GIFT Nifty, which indicates a marginal decline of around 34 points in the Nifty 50. Market sentiment remains mildly indecisive, following a cautious close in the previous session. The Nifty 50 opened weak and traded in a narrow range for most of the session. However, a sudden sell-off towards the end dragged the index lower, forming a bearish candlestick that signals negative sentiment. Technically, a sustained move above 25,378 could pave the way for an upward rally toward 25,500. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 25,120 and 25,000, which may serve as potential entry points for long trades if stability emerges around these levels. The Bank Nifty ended the session in the red, losing 201 points, and formed a bearish candlestick with a long upper wick, reflecting selling pressure at higher levels. A decisive breakdown below 56,600 could lead to further downside toward 56,420 and 56,234. However, if these support levels hold, a reversal may follow, offering fresh buying opportunities. On the upside, resistance lies in the 56,817–57,000 zone, with a breakout above this range potentially triggering a rally toward 57,175. On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers of equities worth ₹5,104 crore on July 11, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers, investing ₹3,558 crore. In the current environment of heightened volatility and mixed market signals, traders are advised to follow a cautious “sell on rise” strategy, especially when trading with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and using tight trailing stop-losses is recommended to manage risk effectively. Fresh long positions should only be considered if the Nifty sustains above the 25,378 level. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is essential to keep a close watch on key technical levels and global market cues.

The fall was mainly due to a $3.53 billion drop in foreign currency assets, which stood at $591.29 billion. In contrast, gold reserves rose by $342 million to $84.5 billion, SDRs increased by $39 million to $18.86 billion, while the IMF reserve position declined by $107 million to $4.73 billion during the same period. 2)Overseas investors repatriated a record $97.7 billion from Indian investments in FY25. This is up from $87.5 billion in FY24. The increase is due to higher FDI inflows and debt investments. RBI data indicates a rise in income from foreign exchange reserves deployment. Indian companies also increased overseas investments. This balanced the investment income segment of the current account. 3)As of July 4, 2025, the RBI’s weekly data shows that loans to state governments rose sharply by ₹10,890 crore over the week to ₹30,956 crore. Scheduled Commercial Banks’ aggregate deposits stood at ₹234.26 lakh crore, growing 1.5% fortnightly and 10.1% YoY, while bank credit rose to ₹184.83 lakh crore, up 0.9% fortnightly and 9.5% YoY. Within M3 (money supply), which rose 9.6% YoY to ₹281.77 lakh crore, demand deposits showed strong 17.1% annual growth. Liquidity operations reflected large-scale absorption by the RBI via the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), peaking at ₹3.32 lakh crore on July 4, with net daily absorption consistently exceeding ₹2.5 lakh crore throughout the week, indicating tight liquidity management. 4)As of June 27, 2025, aggregate deposits of all scheduled banks rose to ₹239.16 lakh crore from ₹235.62 lakh crore in mid-June, with demand deposits at ₹31.22 lakh crore and time deposits at ₹207.95 lakh crore. Bank credit (excluding inter-bank) increased to ₹189.53 lakh crore from ₹187.84 lakh crore, led by loans and advances of ₹186.10 lakh crore. Investments stood at ₹68.54 lakh crore, mainly in central and state government securities. Balances with the RBI were stable at ₹9.53 lakh crore, while cash held fell slightly to ₹89,278 crore. Borrowings from the RBI dropped to ₹1,065 crore, and food credit by scheduled commercial banks declined marginally to ₹64,389 crore from ₹67,606 crore in mid-June. The total number of scheduled commercial banks remained at 120. 5)In June, mutual fund inflows surged 67% month-on-month to ₹49,301 crore from ₹29,572 crore in May, with total AUM rising 3% to ₹74.14 lakh crore. Equity mutual funds saw inflows jump 24% to ₹23,587 crore, led by flexi-cap funds (₹5,733 crore), small-cap (₹4,024 crore), and mid-cap funds (₹3,754 crore), while ELSS recorded outflows of ₹556 crore. Debt funds saw reduced outflows of ₹1,711 crore (vs ₹15,908 crore in May), with short duration (₹10,276 crore) and money market funds (₹9,484 crore) leading inflows; liquid funds faced the highest outflow at ₹25,196 crore. Hybrid funds’ inflows rose 12% to ₹23,222 crore, with arbitrage funds leading at ₹15,584 crore and aggressive hybrid funds jumping 290% to ₹1,331 crore. Passive funds saw inflows drop 28% to ₹3,997 crore, though gold ETFs surged 613% to ₹2,080 crore. 6)SIP inflows hit a fresh all-time high of ₹27,269 crore in June, up 2% from ₹26,688 crore in May, marking the first time inflows crossed the ₹27,000 crore mark. SIP AUM rose to ₹15.30 lakh crore from ₹14.61 lakh crore. New SIP registrations grew to 61.91 lakh in June from 59.14 lakh in May and 46.01 lakh in April, while contributing SIP accounts reached 8.64 crore, up from 8.56 crore in May. Total mutual fund folios rose to 24.13 crore in June from 23.83 crore in May, and retail folios (Equity + Hybrid + Solution Oriented) stood at 19.07 crore (vs. 18.84 crore in May). Retail AUM increased to ₹4,43,994 crore in June from ₹4,21,954 crore in May. 7)JPMorgan is considering reducing the weight of top bond issuers like China and India in its GBI-EM Global Diversified index by lowering the country cap from 10% to 8.5%. The move aims to diversify exposure across emerging markets, potentially raising the index’s average yield by giving more weight to higher-yielding, riskier countries—impacting over $200 billion in funds tracking the benchmark. 8)India’s corporate bond market is set for a major transformation with the launch of Bond Central, a SEBI- and OBPP-backed platform that offers a centralized, transparent database for bond issuances. By providing easy access to pricing, risk metrics, and disclosures, and lowering the minimum investment to ₹10,000, the platform aims to boost retail participation, enhance price discovery, and align with global standards like FINRA TRACE. WORLD 1)The IEA’s July 2025 Oil Market Report highlights a volatile first half of the year for global oil markets, marked by slowing demand growth due to a weaker economic outlook and rising clean energy adoption, particularly in non-OECD countries like China. While seasonal demand is expected to pick up, global supply rose in May as OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers increased output, with non-OPEC+ set to drive future growth. Inventories surged, especially in non-OECD regions, and oil prices fluctuated widely amid geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ policy shifts. Refinery margins peaked in May but were later squeezed by crude price hikes. The report also noted rising NGL output and the impact of global trade and energy policy shifts on market dynamics. 2)The FOMC minutes from the June 17–18, 2025 meeting showed the Fed held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% while continuing balance sheet runoff, set to conclude by Feb 2026. While Q2 GDP rebounded and unemployment held at 4.2%, core PCE inflation at 2.6% remained above target. Tariffs and geopolitical risks may pose near-term inflation pressures, but wage growth was seen as contained. Risks remain tilted toward higher inflation and slower growth, with most members expecting 1–2 rate cuts in 2025, likely starting in September, though views differ. The Fed reaffirmed a data-dependent approach and discussed enhancing policy communication tools. 3)US jobless claims fell to 227K for the week ending July 5, below expectations and down from the revised 232K the prior week. The insured unemployment rate held steady at 1.3%, while the four-week average dropped to 235.5K. However, continuing jobless claims rose by 10K to 1.965 million for the week ending June 28. 4)The latest US Redbook Index (YoY) reading is 5.9%, as of July 2025, according to Trading Economics. This is up from the previous reading of 4.9%. The Redbook Index measures year-over-year same-store sales growth in a sample of large US general merchandise retailers. 5)The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in May, missing expectations of 0.1% growth and following a 0.3% decline in April, according to ONS data. The services index slowed to 0.4% (3M/3M) from 0.6%, while industrial and manufacturing production dropped 0.9% and 1% respectively, both below market forecasts. 6)The UK’s trade deficit widened by £6.7 billion to £13.2 billion in the three months to May, driven by a £6.1 billion rise in the goods deficit to £61 billion and a £0.6 billion dip in the services surplus to £47.8 billion. In May, both exports and imports rose by £0.6 billion. Notably, UK goods exports to the US rose by £0.3 billion, while imports from the US fell £0.9 billion, amid shifts in US trade policy despite a new trade deal effective from June 30. 7)The Bank of England’s July 2025 Financial Stability Report highlights that the UK financial system remains resilient despite rising global risks. Mortgage repayments are set to rise for millions, prompting a relaxation in high loan-to-income limits to support first-time buyers. Key risks include global trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, vulnerabilities in non-bank finance, and climate change. The BoE is also reviewing capital buffer frameworks and enhancing climate risk integration to strengthen systemic stability. 8)Japan’s producer prices rose 2.9% YoY in June 2025, easing from 3.2% in May and marking the lowest print since August 2024, in line with forecasts. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.2%, following a 0.1% drop in May, signaling continued softening in input costs. 9)China’s CPI rose 0.1% YoY in June, rebounding slightly from May’s -0.1% and beating expectations of 0%, while monthly CPI slipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, PPI declined 3.6% YoY, deeper than May’s 3.3% fall and below the expected 3.2%, signaling continued deflationary pressure in factory prices. 10)In a surprise move, the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates steady at 3.85% on July 8, despite market expectations of a cut. The decision, passed by a 6–3 vote, reflects the RBA’s view that inflation risks are more balanced and the labour market remains strong, though uncertainty around demand and supply persists. The board chose to wait for more data to confirm inflation is on track to sustainably reach its 2.5% target. 11)The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) board members decided to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.25% following the conclusion of the July policy meeting on Wednesday. The decision aligned with the market expectations. The RBNZ stood pat on the policy rate after six consecutive cuts. Siemens: Company secures two separate orders worth Rs 773 cr from MAHA-METRO.

Title: Former Xbox employee's LinkedIn page reveals Forza Horizon 5 PS5 sales

Notebookcheck has been contacted by the person whose LinkedIn page mentioned the 2,000,000 number. They claim that it's not accurate first-party data but rather an estimate that they found online. Slightly edited article continues as follows: Earlier this year, Xbox announced that Forza Horizon 5 would become available on the PS5, nearly four years after it was released on Xbox and PC. The game eventually landed on the PlayStation 5 on April 29, 2025 as the first Forza game available on a platform other than Xbox and PC. Now, the LinkedIn page of an Xbox employee has revealed how well the game did on PlayStation. According to a post shared on X by Zuby_Tech, Forza Horizon 5 for the PlayStation 5 sold two million units in one month. The info comes from the LinkedIn page of former Xbox employee who had worked as a game designer at Turn 10 Studios, a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios but was recently laid off along with several others from Xbox. Listing his responsibilities at the studio, the game designer wrote that he created the cross-platform feature designs that allowed Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5 (available on Amazon for $499) to sell 2 million units in one month alone. That's an impressive figure for a video game that was released years ago on Xbox. While we don't know the total sales as of the time of writing, it most likely is well past two million units since it has been over two months since the game launched on the PS5. Xbox's recent layoffs have greatly affected Turn 10 Studios which is best known for its Forza Motorsport series. The studio lost half of its team, and has now been relegated to providing support for the Forza Horizon series. In addition, it has been reported that the Forza Motorsport series has been axed leaving the open world Forza Horizon series which is developed by Playground Games. Forza Horizon is expected to get a new installment next year. Zuby_Tech on X, Pushsquare

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners
URL: https://spiral.spyglass.org/p/strap-in-vision-pro-owners
Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)...

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners

Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI.

Title: Algolia Tops Google In Product Search — Windsurf May Not Help Much

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Gartner rates privately-held Algolia ahead of Google in the $56 billion market for search and product discovery. With Alphabet stock down this year, investors should be worried. GERMANY - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone with the website of ai search ... More engine company Algolia Inc. is seen in front of business logo. (Photo Illustration by Timon Schneider/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The market for digital commerce search reached $56.5 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow at a 12.6% compound annual rate to $185.7 billion in 2033, reports Data Horizon Research. Algolia’s customer base has grown at a 21% average annual rate to 18,000, according to my July 10 interview with Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon. Google — shares of which have lost 5% of their value in 2025 — is confident in the strength of its product discovery search service, according to a Google company release. Gartner rates privately-held San Francisco-based Algolia ahead of Google. Google’s spent $2.4 billion to license Windsurf AI coding technology, reported CNBC. That unlikely to be enough for Google to surpass Algolia — or faster-growing AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google shares have lost value in 2025. That’s because the search giant — which developed the core Transformer model for predicting the next word based on its context underlying generative AI, according to my book, Brain Rush — is struggling to catch up with ChatGPT and others when it comes to commercializing its idea. Is the drop in Google stock a buying opportunity? The answer depends on whether Google can keep its search business relevant. “The market will need to see fundamental evidence that Google search is indeed going to be more durable than currently appreciated,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report featured by Investor’s Business Daily. If rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Meta AI better deploy generative AI to cash in on advertising and improved e-commerce and travel verticals, Google’s stock could keep dropping, noted Nowak. For Google bulls, I have bad news: Algolia — which says it is deploying agentic AI for brands — is ahead of Google in those two search and product discovery verticals. In 2018, I was surprised to learn Google had abandoned the business of helping consumers search through a company's online product catalog, according to my October 2018 Forbes post. Google was good at bringing users to a website but once there, customers relied on the websites’ own search functions to find products. Some companies "build their own engines; others use open-source software, such as Elasticsearch,” the Economist reported. At the time, Algolia — founded in Paris in 2012 — was rapidly taking a piece of that pie by supplying a service that "hunts the client’s website and swiftly offers consumers relevant results," added the Economist. Since then, Google has entered this market and this year was deemed a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for vision and ability to execute. However, within that elite group of leaders, Algolia is the top dog. Read on for why this market is significant and why I do not think Google is doing enough to overtake Algolia and larger rivals in monetizing AI. I requested comment from Google and will update this post if I receive a reply. While analysts use many ways to describe the digital commerce search industry, they agree the industry is growing fast and will become far larger in the next decade. The industry’s goal is to understand consumers’ needs and recommend products that best satisfy those needs. AI is the most significant growth propellent for this business in year — it enhances consumer experiences, increase sales, and boosts engagement, according to SuperAGI. AI-driven recommendation engines can increase customer loyalty, average order size and the lifetime value of a customer. For example, 71% of consumers are more likely to return to a website offering personalized experiences. Moreover, such systems suggest complementary products — thereby increasing average order value by 10% to 15%, reported SuperAGI. Algolia appears to be riding this growth wave. The company provides an AI-native search and discovery platform to enable brands such as PetSmart, Best Buy, Chewy, Twitch, Stripe, and Under Armour to deliver fast, relevant, and personalized search experiences, according to an Algolia release. Algolia’s search-as-a-service solution uses AI recommendations, NeuralSearch, and real-time personalization to boosts user engagement and increase conversion rates, the release added. Algolia has added many customers in the last five years. “When I joined Algolia we had less than 7,000 customers, now we have 18,000,” Nixon — who joined the company in 2020 — told me. “We process two billion transactions per year and have millions of developers on our platform.” Algolia’s growth can be attributed to its ability to satisfy e-commerce search customers’ need for reliable performance at scale. “We provide five nine’s reliability which means only 26 seconds of downtime per month,” she said. “Reliability is really important and it is difficult to do when operating at scale.” Algolia has repeatedly introduced meaningful innovations. “We disrupted the market three times and we are about to do it a fourth,” Nixon explained. Instead of relying on preexisting search software such as Lucene, Algolia’s search was built from scratch to work on mobile. Next, the company introduced search as a service and charged customers based on the number of searches — with the price per search declining with the number of searches. Finally, in 2023, Algolia introduced hybrid search — “combining keyword and natural language search incorporating large language models,” she told me. Algolia is most excited about agentic AI — which will enable consumers to take action towards a goal. The company uses Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol — which allows AI agents to access Algolia's search, analytics, recommendations, and index configuration APIs. “AI agents must be able to work across walled gardens to traverse a company’s back-end seamlessly to retrieve data,” she said. “To that end, we have partnered with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager.” Algolia’s customers are benefiting from how much consumers’ use of ChatGPT to search for products is adding to web traffic. “Adobe Analytics has found generative AI is giving retailers and banks 1,200% traffic increases while travel sites are seeing 1,700% increases,” she told me. “When people come to a retailer’s site they bounce 23% less frequently and look at 12% more pages per visit.” Algolia also provides personalized digital shopping guides — say, for Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day — targeted towards various lifestyles. “In beta test, we have 73 shopping guides already,” she concluded. Google's offerings — notably Google Ads and Vertex AI Search for Commerce — can boost retailer revenues in three ways: In July 2025, Gartner ranked Google and Algolia as Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery leaders based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Algolia is the leader among leaders — prevailing over Google. Algolia is proud of Gartner’s recognition. “This is the second year we have been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery,” Nixon told me. “We are up and to the right in the leader box which makes us the best in the industry for completeness of vision and ability to execute. How? We want to make search easy for the masses. We wanted to be scalable in the enterprise. We solve the search puzzle for the masses.” Google was happy to be an MQ leader. “We believe this recognition affirms Google’s evolving commitment to delivering high ROI-generating product discovery, through the use of AI in relevance, ranking, and personalization,” noted Google Cloud AI Director, Product Management Sachin Padwal in a July 8 company release. Algolia is ahead of Google in applying agentic AI for search and product discovery. While Google has not yet launched such a service, on July 11 the search giant acquired executive talent and intellectual property from Windsurf — a leader in agentic AI, noted CNBC. Algolia’s MCP Server — launched in June 2025 — enables LLMs and autonomous agents to work together to help consumers buy what they need more quickly. For example, Algolia’s agentic AI service can help consumers book a Mediterranean cruise. By retrieving relevant consumer information from platforms such as Adobe and Salesforce. For example, Algolia agentic AI service can recommend and book a cruise based on each guest’s chosen destinations, travel history, and other preferences — in milliseconds, according to a company release. “This isn’t about showing off what agents could do,” Nixon said. “It’s about showing what they can do right now with a powerful user experience, if they have the right layer of intelligence underneath. That’s where Algolia fits.” Meanwhile, Google is currently experimenting with agentic AI for travel. Google’s “AI Mode” will be able to “plan full itineraries, remember context, and keep users within the AI interface — even for booking,” noted Hospitality.today. “Google’s Project Mariner” will enable “AI to take actions online -- like booking a hotel or tracking flight prices.” Google stock is 12% undervalued based on the average price target of 37 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRank. If Algolia’s lead over Google in search and product discovery is any indication, those analysts could be too optimistic.

Title: What it takes to be a thriving Amazon seller making seven figures

Time Published: 2025-07-13T10:39:01Z
Full Content:
Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all? Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does. What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you. On the agenda today: But first: Side hustle tips from the pros. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online. Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success. How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers? A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club. What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits? The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to "a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there." He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum. What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle? After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming. I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, "It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you." For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration. BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like "fear," "uncertainty," "disheartening," and "bleak" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service. "I can't see any of this ending well."
