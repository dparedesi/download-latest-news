Kevin Rose: Tim-Tim, another episode of The Random Show. Glad to be back. Tim Ferriss: Another episode of The Random Show. Kevin Rose: This is awesome. Tim Ferriss: You look very dashing. For people who can’t see you, you have hair slicked back, jacket with wide open lapels, reminiscent of a leather jacket. You look like a leading man from The Outsiders, that movie back in the day. You just need a cigarette in your pocket and some other goodies, but you’re looking good, looking good. You also have, as you disclosed to me, your secret weapon nearby an IKEA light that is providing very seductive shadows and contours on your face. So, well done. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think we’re both hacking it together today. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, today has been putting together the boxcar on the way down the hill in a sense, from an equipment standpoint, but here we are. Kevin Rose: Here we are. Tim Ferriss: We made it. Now, you asked me to grab a glass of wine, which I didn’t do. I ended up grabbing a glass of Gin, Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill gin. For anybody who’s curious, I do like my gin, B-A-R-R Hill. But this might surprise people and it surprised me because last time we spoke, I think you had hit, what was it, six months or however long it was. Six months sober. So what is unfolding before our very eyes? Kevin Rose: Well, what’s unfolding is a glass of champagne is what’s unfolding, but I’ll say that I almost made it to seven months, but then I just decided — my original goal was three months, and then I made it to six, and was I going to continue to go on like this? And I had hung out with some friends. We had a dinner in San Francisco, and I thought, “You know, I’m going to have a glass of vino. I’m just going to have a glass of wine because I don’t want to make this…” It was actually, there was a great book. You know the book Awareness, which you’ve recommended to me. Tim Ferriss: It’s one of my favorites. I have one of my many copies downstairs right now. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: Yeah. So, Anthony de Mello, Jesuit priest. Correct? Is that right? Tim Ferriss: Jesuit priest, who is also a psychotherapist who is now since passed, but incredibly, incredibly compelling writing. I’m sure we’ll get more into this because I listened to the audiobook you recommended, so we’ll come back to that. Kevin Rose: Oh, cool. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But all right, so take us back to the story you’re telling. So, you’re sitting there — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Well, prior to that, I had re-listened to that book and I got it on audio. And one of the things that hit me that he said in the book was — Tim Ferriss: I know what it was. Can I guess? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you do. Yeah, go for it. Tim Ferriss: That abstinence or asceticism. Renunciation is as much a trap, or can be as much a trap as anything else because it ties you, it binds you to the thing that you are from. Kevin Rose: That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. It makes it your lifelong enemy. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And it binds you to it. And so, you’re like, “Fuck it, Yolo. Let’s have some wine.” Kevin Rose: Well, I want to be bound to it. And then I did that with a glass of wine, so no, but I — Tim Ferriss: Break those chains. Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. But the plan was never to be sober for life. It was to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol and get to a point where I could truly say to anyone that asks, the cravings have gone away. And my goal going forward is something I just call the 2-2-2 rule, which is maximum of two drinks at any given night, never two days in a row, and then two days a week. So, just lightweight. That’s my new thing. And then also special occasions, I want it to be about a celebration of something or a gathering in some way that’s meaningful, not just because a football game’s on or something. Tim Ferriss: Well, first I have more to say, but cheers. I have my little Japanese mug — Kevin Rose: Cheers. Tim Ferriss: — full of Barr Hill gin. Cheers. Kevin Rose: Wait, wait, straight up gin? Tim Ferriss: That’s just straight gin. I didn’t have any ice. You’ve inspired me to cut way back on my drinking, so I haven’t really had much. I don’t want to open a bottle of wine that I’m not going to finish with friends or something. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I mean, you finished your bottle of gin. Tim Ferriss: So I just grabbed what I had open, which stay good for a long while once open, which was this gin. So, I’m not going to drink a full glass of gin, but I will have a sip with you. Kevin Rose: I think we’re both going to be cheap dates maybe then, because if we haven’t drank in a while, we might get really sloppy really fast. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very cheap dates. So, let me follow up on this story and the 2-2-2 plan. How are you intending, if at all, to catch yourself if you start slipping? Do you have people who you want to hold you accountable? Do you have some type of calendar reminder in place? How do you keep an eye on that? Recognizing that you may very well be totally fine, but given the history that you have, it seems like it’d be a good idea to put some guardrails in there. Kevin Rose: Well, I agree with you wholeheartedly if my issue with alcohol had been one of excess consumption in that, I was never a six or seven drink or even five drink person. For me, it was more consistency. So, the one that is easier to catch is you wake up the next morning and you say, “Okay, I’m just not drinking tonight because you’re catching it in a sober state, which is huge.” So, it’s the big foul that I had over the last few years, especially to start with COVID was just two drinks a night, maybe three, and just continuing that and taking a day or two off a week, that’s not healthy as my liver enzymes would report back. I’m not as concerned about that. But also, I’ve talked to my therapist about this and she’s amazing. And she’s like, “Hey, I’m going to check in with you and just make sure that you’re truly sticking to this.” But I think an accountability partner is absolutely a necessity, especially when it’s been such a staple of your life for decades. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. And I think for you, one thing that immediately hops to mind, which seems super mundane, but I know you have a lot of anxiety around flying, and I don’t think that flying counts as a special occasion, right? So, you’ll need to — Kevin Rose: Oh, it absolutely does. It absolutely does. That flying — Tim Ferriss: You fly so much though. Kevin Rose: We are in the air, we shouldn’t be able to do that as humans. It is an amazing feat of engineering. So, yes, it’s special. Tim, don’t take this away from me, God damn it. Tim Ferriss: All right. Wow, I’m going to — Kevin Rose: This is one thing. Tim Ferriss: I’m going to call that the yellow flag in the making, but you know what — Kevin Rose: I’m fine with one yellow flag. I do fly a bit, but you know what’s funny is when I came back from SFO when I actually had that first drink, I didn’t want a second drink on the plane. And honestly, it’s that just like anxiety of the whole process of it all, the security and the packed jets and the people coughing next to you. And once I get settled, I’m pretty good, unless it’s an international flight and I’m with friends. So, yeah, I think it’s that first drink actually goes a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. On that note, first drink goes a long way, especially if it’s just straight up gin. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: Where else should we segue? Because we can come back to this, but we have a lot to catch up on. There is lot. Kevin Rose: So much to catch up on and why don’t we just go back and forth and just have it be an old school Random Show where everything’s random, we have no idea we’re about to talk about. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s go for it. So, I’ll share an update on my side, which folks might find interesting. As you know and long-term listeners know, I have been one way you could put it as an early adopter looking at bioelectric medicine of different types, whether that is legitimate vagus nerve stimulation. By the way, there aren’t many options that would fall in that category, interviewing people like Dr. Kevin Tracey, but also looking at most acutely transcranial magnetic stimulation. So, TMS, which is a form of brain stimulation. I’ll keep it simple, that has existed for decades. But there was an innovation by the very recently late Nolan Williams, sadly, and others called accelerated TMS, where you basically take something like 50 stimulations, like 50 different sessions. And you compress it into one week, as opposed to doing it over the course of many months. And this type of dense dosing schedule produces some, in many people, incredible effects. And you saw me after my first experience of accelerated TMS, which was with a device called MagVenture device. It uses neuro targeting. So, you need a resting state fMRI and so on to determine where they’re actually going to place this stimulation depending on your condition and your own individual anatomy and activity. So, if it’s depression, they might point it in one direction or in one place. If it’s anxiety or OCD, they might point it somewhere else. And I effectively had, let’s just call it eight or nine out of 10, resting state generalized anxiety. Kevin Rose: Was this self-reported? Meaning, when you went in there to get the resting state scan, were you like, “Hey, I’m coming in here with ED and general anxiety, I need you to treat this for me.” And then they would — Tim Ferriss: Did you say ED? Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. I know it’s an issue, but oh, we can cut this if you want. We can cut this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, nice, nice. Very cute. Kevin Rose: No, but all the joking aside — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Kevin Rose: — how did you determine the areas? Did you have to tell them, this is what I’m coming in to treat, or is this something they see? Tim Ferriss: Well, they do interviews and assessments that are qualitative. Let’s just say asking you what your symptoms are, why are you coming here in the first place? Then they would dig into the details and then they would run you through various standardized tests or assessments. So, you might have the MADRS, you might have the HAM-D. You might have the Y-BOCS. They’re different assessments that are accepted as standardized for diagnosing, say OCD or any number of other psychiatric conditions. And then you get an fMRI. So, you get this scan of your brain, which I did at, I think it was Mass General in Massachusetts as you would guess. And based on that, they can do some precision targeting. And just to give people the upshot of that, I did five days of stimulations and that gave me basically three to four months of effectively a zero on a scale of zero to 10 of generalized anxiety. So, from that point forward, effectively, no anxiety. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: The rumination, the anxious mental loops that I would get involved with late at night, that would then in turn affect my sleep and cause onset insomnia, et cetera, that went to zero for a period of say, three to four months, which blew my mind. Kevin Rose: Just out of curiosity, were you tracking Oura data and whatnot, so you could see the impact of this as measured by different devices? Tim Ferriss: I wasn’t looking at Oura at that point in time. I have been tracking with Oura at least for the last three to four weeks. And so, I’m going to be taking a closer look at things like HRB and so on in terms of trending. But the upshot of it is that, and I’ll try to compress this a little bit. But that first time I did accelerated TMS, I had this incredible effect, much more durable in terms of its intensity of effect and relief than even any psychedelic therapy, or psychedelic assisted therapy that I’ve looked into. And those were effectively ended up being the two modalities with the greatest effect size on the psychiatric conditions that I was most personally interested in. And where I have funded a lot of early stage science. Unfortunately, when I then went to do boosters to do shorter duration, two or three days, nothing happened. So, my symptoms started creeping back in, which seemed to be hereditary. Just to put that out there, right? I recognize objectively, I’m like, “There isn’t really anything I should be so anxious about. I recognize that very clearly. Nonetheless, I get caught in these OCD/GAD, generalized anxiety disorder loops, and I see that in family members. So, it seems to be somewhat genetic. In any case, none of these boosters worked. And then I was like, “Fuck, this is terrible. Okay, well let me go back and do the full five days.” Full five days, didn’t do anything. And then I was looking back at the calendar and trying to identify anything that might have correlated, or preceded the first treatment that helped make it work. And I did see that I’d spent a few weeks in the Amazon maybe ending about two weeks prior to that treatment. So, since I was ingesting plants of various types that are known to induce some degree of neuroplasticity, I thought, well, it could be that it was a plasticity issue, a preconditioning that helped that first session. So, I tried to replicate that using psilocybin and did another five days, no effect, didn’t have any effect, and was starting to feel really hopeless about this. But then came across some research that this is going to sound pretty wild, and this is definitely early, early stages. So, to my knowledge, I’m maybe one out of fewer than a hundred people who have been one of the first monkeys shot in the space doing this specifically for anxiety. It has been applied to more people with depression, but decided to try simultaneous dosing with something called D-cycloserine (DCS). So, D-cycloserine, D-C-Y-C-L-O-S-E-R-I-N-E, is very, very interesting. So, it is an antibiotic that historically has been used to treat tuberculosis and urinary tract infections, but it is also now being studied. And for the last several years, people have been looking at this as a cognitive enhancer for treating various neuropsychiatric conditions. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Now, how they figured this out, I’m not sure. I mean, it could have been working backwards through the purported mechanism of action. So, D-cycloserine has been looked at in conjunction with say, CBT, like cognitive behavioral therapy and all sorts of different things. And part of what people believe makes it effective as an amplifier of effects, although there can be side effects and sometimes the pendulum swings the other direction is that it is a partial agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Now, ketamine also works on NMDA receptors, but it’s an antagonist. So, it’s very different in that respect. But I will again try to cut to the punchline. So, instead of doing five days, I did one day, just one day of basically a stimulation every hour on the hour for 10 hours and preloaded with a lozenge that you just let of melt in your mouth with this D-cycloserine, and it worked one day. It had some side effects. I had insomnia for about two weeks, which seems to happen in some patients who have undergone this. Some people have really bad insomnia for a month and then it goes away. And I was willing to take that risk. There’s some other things that can crop up, like temporary loss of some fine motor control and some other weird stuff. Kevin Rose: Oh, Jesus. Tim Ferriss: Tinnitus in some people. Kevin Rose: Wow, with just the treatment in general. Did the papers that you’re signing and say, this may happen? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, with any of this stuff, you’re writing your life away with some signatures. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s like frontier stuff. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but the point that I’m trying to make here in a pretty long-winded way is number one, it worked. So, that leads me to believe that the original hypothesis that it was around neuroplasticity, so I needed to warm up the Play-Doh before it could be molded properly, could be accurate, right? That could be true. Secondly, and this is incredibly important, most people I know who are really busy, or most people who can’t afford it, can’t take five days off of work. They can’t take a week off of work to do this treatment no matter how bad their symptoms might be. And the fact that this D-cycloserine, like DCS enhanced treatment was able to be compressed into a single day, I feel like it opens up the multitude of people who can potentially use this tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, who knows? And it should also at the same time really decrease the cost. So, it’s made me even more bullish around accelerated TMS, and it’s been, I’d have to go back and look maybe a month, six weeks, but it’s still sticking, which is remarkable. So, in any case, for people who want to hear more, they can listen to my podcast with Nolan Williams that goes into a lot of detail around this, but very exciting stuff. It turns out a lot of these things might be interrelated and that certain types of TMS when implemented properly actually seem to also stimulate the vagus nerve in some interesting ways. So, this is the next frontier that I’m most interested in exploring right now is bioelectric medicine, right? So, computer chips over pills and so on. I think it allows you, in some respects to get much more targeted. So, that’s good news for me, but I think it’s also obviously at the edges of medicine right now. But I think that in the next two to three years, I could see this becoming a much more accessible therapeutic for millions of people. And there’s some companies you can watch. I mentioned one MagVenture or Magventures. The other is called Brainsway, and they’re actually a very small company, but publicly traded, and I’m sure there are going to be more entrants. So, super exciting stuff. But now I feel like I have a recipe worth trying to replicate where maybe once a quarter, maybe twice a year, depending on when — I think I see symptoms start to creep back in. I don’t think this is a one and done, nor is any psychedelic assisted therapy that I’m aware of. So, I expect it’ll be some type of ongoing treatment that I do one, two to four times per year. Kevin Rose: And when you think of the potential in one and inability to replicate this again in others, I know you put a lot of cash personally into philanthropic things around research and studies, are you curious to push on these buttons and see, can you put together a trial with 50 people and Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Kevin Rose: What’s your thoughts there? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would definitely be interested in funding more research. The Brain Stimulation Lab at Stanford, I’ve already funded some research within. Very sadly, Nolan Williams, who helped develop a lot of these technologies died, I mean I want to say it was a month or two ago by suicide, very sadly. Kevin Rose: Oh, jeez. Tim Ferriss: And he was a friend and really heartbreaking to see. And I mean it’s hard to put that aside for the moment, but putting it aside for the moment, I did fund research within that lab. I suspect that’s going to take time to implement, particularly given the leadership vacuum that was created by his very, very tragic death. But I am interested in funding more research, and this is an ongoing thing. As you know, my foundation, the Saisei Foundation, has funded all sorts of on the edge research since 2015 or so, I would say. So, this is for sure where I would like to fund more research, particularly looking at these combinations. And that could be something like these, like a D-cycloserine plus stimulation. And at certain clinics, they have cohorts of say 60 — I think it’s at the time that I did it, there were 60 patients who had been treated for some form of anxiety disorder with this combination. I think that at least at that particular clinic on the depression side, the numbers are larger, probably 200 or so. But it’s exciting, it’s exciting. I mean that’s enough to get a signal, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And sure, you need to check all the boxes and do the randomized placebo controlled studies with multiple arms and all that, but it is enough to start to see a signal, especially when you have treatment resistant cases that haven’t responded to other things. And that’s enough to inform at least the design of a study that would take much longer. So, we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But I will say that much some people experience with GLP-1 agonists like Tirzepatide, and Mounjaro or Ozempic or whatever, after these treatments and maybe it’s just from really putting the brakes on a lot of the OCD like circuitry, that I had much less desire to over consume caffeine, to over consume alcohol. It made dialing all of those things back a lot easier, which has been — Kevin Rose: And you know that’s a massive benefit of GLP-1s for a lot of people? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which is huge. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Well, dude, I’m pumped for you, man. It’s like I love to see you getting some relief here, even if just for a few months, and that’s fantastic, it’s repeatable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. So, fingers crossed. We’ll see. And for people who want to learn more, I would suggest they start with, as eerie as it might be, my conversation on the podcast with Nolan Williams. All right, man, you’re up. What’s next? Kevin Rose: Speaking of brain-related things, I was out a dinner with a friend and I was lamenting in talking about just my inability to remember faces, names, and then how that extended into childhood for me, which was doing poorly on tests and just I couldn’t quite retain the information the way that my friends could. I just could never explain it. Somebody at dinner, my buddy Mao said to me, “Do you have aphantasia?” And I said, “I have no idea what that is.” And then he said, “Okay, I want you to close your eyes right now,” and this is going to blow some people’s minds right now. “Close your eyes and picture an apple in your mind’s eye. Picture an apple. What do you see? Do you see a red apple? Do you see water droplets on it? Does it look fresh? Does it look like an HD image?” And that’s what he said to me. I go, “What are you talking about?” And he goes, “Well, what does it look like to you?” And I go, “There’s no apple.” He goes, “What do you mean there’s no apple?” And I said, “Well, there’s like an outline, ghosty foggy thing, maybe-ish.” And he goes, “Oh, you have aphantasia.” And I was immediately jumped, whatever, ChatGPT. And I had no idea that people suffer from this condition and it’s in the low single digit percentage of people, and they have no idea that this is a thing where you cannot picture something in your mind’s eye. Had you heard of this before or no? Tim Ferriss: No, I hadn’t until you dropped it in one of our group friend text threads. This was, I guess a couple of weeks ago. But Fantasia is spelled like the Disney movie, but actually no, that would be with an F. It’s aphantasia, A-P-H-A-N-T-A-S-I-A, yeah, is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images first described in 1880. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: When you close your eyes, what do you see? Because they give you a scale there, and a five is like an HD full on, beautiful apple. What do you see? Do you see a perfect quality apple? Tim Ferriss: So aphantasia can be considered the opposite of hyperphantasia. I am the exact opposite. I have hyper-visual recall and the ability — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — to visualize. So I can probably draw the vast majority of restaurants or the floor plans that I’ve ever visited, right? I can absolutely spec it out and have very, very vivid visualization. So I would be on the far other end of the spectrum. Kevin Rose: So when you think of a new idea, do you see it in some ways? Because I feel it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You are very similar to my friend Mike, because I remember Mike and I have a lot of shared flight time with psychedelic experiences, and he was describing how he has almost no visual imagery, and it’s almost purely kinesthetic for him. And that is as hard for me to imagine as it is for him to imagine my experience, which is overwhelmingly explosively visual. Kevin Rose: What’s crazy, dude, is how many things I think I thought were jokes. When people said they counted sheep before they went to bed. I was like, “Oh, that’s funny. Would you count numbers in your head?” But I didn’t know they see sheep. I didn’t know. And if you’re younger, mute the podcast for 10 seconds, I didn’t know the spank bank was a real bank you could visit. I thought I didn’t even know that was a thing. I seriously didn’t — Tim Ferriss: Well, to be clear, it’s not a bank with tellers and — Kevin Rose: No, but it is in your head. Tim Ferriss: — safety security boxes. Kevin Rose: It’s in your head. You can open up the box and go back and see that. I can’t see any of that. It sucks. My buddy from Diggnation Podcast was like, after we stopped recording, he’s like, “”You’ve got to be kidding me. So, you can’t go back and look at people you’ve dated in the past during intimate moments and see, revisualize that?” I’m like, “No, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And he goes, “Oh, yeah.” He’s like, “Oh,” he felt so bad for me. He was almost starting to cry for me. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Tim Ferriss: What do you think you have, if anything, developed in compensation of that? Kevin Rose: Well, the one thing that I have never been able to explain is that the feeling side of it, everything is that everything is a feeling. So I have a friend of mine, and I’m not this way, but she composes music and she said that she sees in her head music is represented as colors. And so, when I come up with ideas for projects, I’m not seeing something. I’m traversing a feeling of a path, rather than a visual thing. It’s funny you mentioned the fear of flying. I think part of the reason why I have such a vivid fear of flying is that feeling comes so strong of the plane crashing, not that I see the plane crashing. So, it’s just a different thing, but I wouldn’t trade that for the world. That has served me quite well in investing and seeing around corners early and things of that nature. But when I explain that to people, you feel a new idea. There’s been a bunch of people that have no idea what I’m talking about and something they can’t. I think you can probably have both, but new ideas come from this rising of feeling, not visual, if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: Wild. I mean, it doesn’t really make sense to me, but it would make sense to my friend Mike. And thinking about all this and hearing about your friend who I think you said sees musical notes as colors, that’s often referred to as synesthesia. And there’s a really amazing little book that I read ages ago. It’s been around for a long time. I’m looking at it right now. It was published in 1987, but it’s 192 pages. Anyone who’s interested in memory and mind and the vast differences between people might be interested in this, it’s called The Mind of a Mnemonist, I think is how it’s pronounced, like mnemonic device, M-N-E-M-O-N-I-S-T, a little book about a vast memory. The author’s name is A.R. Those are initials, A.R. Luria, L-U-R-I-A. And here the description’s very short, so I’ll just read it. “This study explores the inner world of a rare human phenomenon — a man who was endowed with virtually limitless powers of memory. From his intimate knowledge of S., the mnemonist, gained from conversations and testing over a period of almost thirty years, A.R. Luria is able to reveal in rich detail not only the obvious strengths of S.’s astonishing memory but also his surprising weaknesses: his crippling inability to forget, his pattern of reacting passively to life, and his uniquely handicapped personality.” Fascinating, fascinating book that I really recommend to people, but aphantasia, who knew? Kevin Rose: You know who I should talk to is Joshua Waitzkin, because didn’t he say that he feels chess? And for people that don’t know, he was the guy that was based on the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Searching for Bobby Fischer was originally a book and then a movie, which was based on the childhood chess prodigy chapters of Josh Waitzkin’s life. And Josh hates that term prodigy. He has some unusual hardware to be sure, but he also has a really incredible framework that he’s applied to now four or five different fields to become world-class in all of them. But he does have a feeling about certain things. One of the stories that he has told me is he was playing a simul, which means he was playing, I don’t know what the number was, 30 or 20 to 40 people simultaneously where he is walking around a room and playing — Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, you do it really fast, right? You just look and then move. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he’s just moving from table to table really quickly, and I think was with some very high level high school players, something like that. Maybe they were younger, I can’t recall. But he was going around, he’s playing 20 or 30 simultaneous games in his head. And then at one point, he explained it as it feels like you’re juggling 20 or 30 balls in the air. And then he got to one table and he felt all the balls come crashing to the ground. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And he said, it felt as though I just missed a ball, and they’d all fallen on the ground, and he couldn’t quite figure out why that was the case. And then he was able to deduce that one of the kids had cheated, one of the kids had moved a piece. Kevin Rose: Oh, no way. Tim Ferriss: And it was just a gut feeling. And then that visual that allowed him to figure out which of the kids had cheated. It’s just insane. Kevin Rose: Holy shit. Tim Ferriss: That people can even do that. Yeah, yeah. Josh. Yeah, if you want to listen to Joshua Waitzkin’s first ever podcast, you were podcast episode number one, and he was podcast episode number two, if I remember correctly. Kevin Rose: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Wild character. Oh, man. Let’s see. Kevin Rose: All right, you’re up. Tim Ferriss: I’m up. Well, I’ll give another medical one that I think is interesting. And I’ve been texting and interacting with Matt Walker a lot on this. Matt is a scientist. He wrote a book, Why We Sleep, and is about as credible as you can be within the world of sleep science and — Kevin Rose: He’s the best. And he’s a great human. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. Kevin Rose: Fantastic human. Tim Ferriss: Great guy, has the most pleasing dulcet tones with that British accent and kind lilt in the voice. Kevin Rose: Plus 10 IQ accent, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Plus 10 or 20 IQ points with the accent. But his podcast is also excellent, and we can link to it in the show notes, but he did an episode on a class of sleep medication called DORAs and DORA stands for dual orexin receptor antagonists. And the reason that DORAs became very interesting to me is that I have Alzheimer’s in my family, and it’s left right and center for me right now because I have three relatives currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and I — Kevin Rose: Holy shit. That’s your APOE e4 negative folks? Tim Ferriss: It includes APOE e4 negative folks. So, we won’t get too far into the genetics, but people who should not be, based on that particular parameter, should not be particularly inclined to Alzheimer’s, nonetheless have Alzheimer’s. And then there are of course people who have three, four, I don’t think any of them are APOE e33, I am APOE e34. So, compared to a 33 that, at least, as I understand it would predispose me and say 2.5 times. Kevin Rose: You and my wife and Rhonda Patrick, and Attia, too, actually is a 34. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there you go. Kevin Rose: All of you guys. I’m the only one that’s not. Crazy. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, in effect, to our current understanding, you want to mitigate the accumulation of two things, is one is beta amyloid plaque, another is tangles that are created by tau proteins. And sleep is really imperative for this. And if you have sleep issues as I have for decades, the onset insomnia, low percentage of deep sleep, et cetera, you’re effectively unable to have your garbage service within the brain clear out these at a rate that offsets the accumulation. Kevin Rose: But we don’t know if these are causal, right? There’s never been any conclusion whether these are causal. They’re most likely the protective effects of something else gone awry. Do you agree with that? Tim Ferriss: I would say that, based on our best understanding, if you can mitigate the accumulation of these things, there seems to be, at the very least, delaying of the progression of these diseases. And there are different drugs and fusions like Donanemab and so on that are predicated on that understanding of the mechanism. This is still early days in the world of Alzheimer’s, but it seems very defensible with our understanding currently that the less of this stuff you accumulate, the better off you are. Kevin Rose: Do you follow Dale Bredesen’s work, by the way? Tim Ferriss: I don’t. Let’s come back to that. Kevin Rose: Okay. Tim Ferriss: Let me just quickly tie this up and say that an example of a DORA would be Belsomra. There are many others, or I should say a handful of others, but I have taken as I believe you have — well, actually no, it was too strong for you, but — Kevin Rose: I gave you some, dude. Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah, that’s right. You gave me the Belsomra. Kevin Rose: I gave you a bunch of Belsomra and you were going to give me some other shit back and you never gave me anything good. Tim Ferriss: Well, hold on, hold on. That’s still pending, but let me come back. So, you gave me the Belsomra, but I said using it, I was going to get it on a prescription. It’s expensive as fuck. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I paid a shit-ton for it, and then I didn’t use it. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, all right, I’ll take your Belsomra. But the Trazodone, I got off of Trazodone and switched as a sleep medication to, in this case, Belsomra, because it was literally down the street in an Uber at your house, not recommending you use your friend’s bootleg drugs, by the way, talk to your doctor, but — Kevin Rose: We also have physicians that are looking at all our shit, so it’s not — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, right. But I have been, now, on Belsomra for a few months as hopefully a — it’s too strong to say it’s a preventative strategy, but at least a delay strategy for potentially Alzheimer’s and other associated neurodegenerative conditions. So, I would encourage people, and I’ll link to this in the show notes, to check out Matt Walker’s podcast on this specifically. Kevin Rose: You know what they did with Belsomra where they tap the spines of people that took it and they noticed there were less tau, the proteins in the spinal fluid? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they cleared a lot more. I mean, I think it was they looked at animal models and then they looked at humans. And in that podcast episode also, Matt discusses data related to comparing, say Belsomra or I should say DORAs to Ambien, right? And not all sleep medications are created equal. A lot of sleep medications effectively sedate you. But in the case of DORAs, orexin, as I understand it, is a wakefulness. Hmm, I think it’s a hormone, but this is effectively inhibiting wakefulness as opposed to sedating. And by using that particular approach, you’re able to create more naturalistic sleep. So it’s preserving sleep architecture, increasing certain things like REM sleep. In any case, it’s very interesting because as it stands, look, sure, like exercise for a natural release of cloth, watch your diet, blah, blah, blah. There are a handful of things here. Sleep, super critically important if we’re talking about, again, staving off, hopefully neurodegenerative disease, but there really just aren’t that many tools in the toolkit. So, to come across some of this data via Matt Walker was very eye-opening to me. So, that’s — Kevin Rose: That’s awesome. Tim Ferriss: That’s also something that I’m looking at really closely. Kevin Rose: I will say the scariest test I have done in my life was about three months ago. I went and had my blood work done and had the towel, the full on, you can check your blood now to see if you are producing, or we’re always producing it, but if you’re out of bounds, meaning you’re above the norm in your production of these types of proteins. And if you are, it’s like 99 percent chance you’re on the path to some form of dementia, right? And did you do that test? Tim Ferriss: I have just done a whole battery of different tests. And — Kevin Rose: Did you do the p-tau one though? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m going to have all that stuff. So, I will — Kevin Rose: It’s scary, dude. You come hang with me, we’ll have a drink or something. Tim Ferriss: I’m looking at all my results in probably two or three weeks because I have a few online batteries that I’m going to do assessments. Kevin Rose: It is absolutely terrifying because the doctor was like, “Hey, do you want to do this? I have this available.” And I was like, “Sure, go ahead.” And then three days afterwards, I’m like, “I should look up what that test is all about.” And there’s three of them now that can detect these various proteins that are essentially, if you have elevated levels, you’re on marching orders or you’re heading towards some type of dementia. And I realized that and I was like, “Wow, if this comes back positive, this is an emergency situation where high intensity interval training every single morning for an hour. There’s a lot of things you have to get into.” And it’s a very frightening thing. It’s a very frightening thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it can be super frightening. And there’s certain other things that I think are just holistically good for my particular goals, cognitive, psychological, physical, like the ketogenic diet. I recently did a podcast with David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, and he and his wife have a foundation that it is the largest funder of science related to metabolic therapies with a particular focus on ketogenic therapy. So, I will be doing all of December in ketosis as an example. Kevin Rose: Oh, that’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just to keep that metabolic machinery humming because I do think it’s plausible that it could help longterm with a lot of the stuff we’re talking about. Kevin Rose: So, Tim, real quick, just to put a bow on this, Dale. Yeah, so the reason I like Dale, Dale’s a scientist that studies all forms of dementia. He has a book called The End of Alzheimer’s. You’ve probably heard of that book. It’s pretty popular. Tim Ferriss: I’ve come across his name. Yeah. Kevin Rose: He’s a little bit different than most of the scientists out there where he believes that Alzheimer’s and these other dementias, they’re not just a one size fits all, one thing went wrong, but it can be a suite of different things that go wrong that lead you down this path. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: And so, it’s metabolic disorder, it’s potential toxins. I think he’s like the four major contributors to different various forms of dementia. And he’s developed this protocol that can stabilize and even reverse a lot of this early cognitive decline if you catch it early enough. And it’s a little bit of throwing the whole kitchen sink at it because it’s everything. And he’s not quite sure exactly what is doing in the fix here, but it’s fascinating, the research that he’s done, two things that stood out to me that he recommends is one, getting this p-tau test done on the blood front and then also recommends the ketogenic diet. And this ketogenic diet is huge for people. And he’s seen that alone stabilize people from mental decline. And not that they’re not eventually going to get it, but the point is, do you want to go into full decline within five years or do you want it to be 15 years, right? And so, that’s what his lab’s focused on. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Yeah, I’ll check him out. I mean I’ve seen, not that this is a necessarily sustainable or scalable approach, but with some of my relatives with Alzheimer’s where it’s pretty progressed and they tend to give one word answers or get confused and give the wrong answer to questions, giving them, say, 35 milliliters of exogenous ketones. So, they’re not in ketosis, they’re following the terrible diet they’ve always followed, but give them 35 milliliters of high octane exogenous ketones before going for a walk. And within 30 minutes, they’re speaking in full sentences. I mean, you see some really wild temporary, but nonetheless, very interesting transformations, which comes back to what you said about metabolic syndrome. And there are good reasons why some folks refer to Alzheimer’s as type three diabetes, right? Kevin Rose: A hundred percent. And that’s what he says in his book. He’s like, that is definitely a contributor, like excess blood glucose levels and all the downstream inflammation effects that come from that. It’s Bad News Bears, as you like to say. That’s Tim Ferriss is — Tim Ferriss: Bad News Bears. All right, Kevin, what have you got? Kevin Rose: I wanted to give people a quick little update on the State of the Union around all things AI. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, please. I could use it too. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s just such a fascinating time in that every, I’d call it four to eight weeks, maybe a slight bit longer, sometimes less so, we’re seeing leapfrogs in what is possible. And one of the things that I would caution people against is forming an opinion about AI and then locking yourself in time around that opinion. I’ll give you a great practical example. I have a lot of engineers that said, “Hey, I tried AI for coding. It was horrible. My first question is, when did you try it? And they said, “Oh, three months ago.” And I’m like, “No, no, you don’t understand. It’s three to four times better than it was three months ago,” right? And so, we have to make sure that even if you are looking at some of these technologies and say, “Hey, it can’t do X or it’s horrible, it’s hallucinating in this way. It’s giving me the wrong answer. This is without a doubt the massive Motorola block phone version of the iPhone.” We are in that realm of AI, the very first innings of it all and every few months. I mean even Opus four or five came out three, four days ago, whatever, it’s a means — Tim Ferriss: Explain what that is. Kevin Rose: Okay, so when you think about frontier models, meaning do you have the bigs Anthropic, you’ve got Google, you’ve OpenAI, OpenAI, and then I’d throw a couple others in there, Meta’s trying in some sense and perplexity and whatnot. But when you think about the big massive models that are running that are at the bleeding edge of all this, meaning they’re the best of the best, the most expensive per query, what happens is they have to train these data sets and then they go in and they eventually release a model, right? And these are typically marked by software versioning numbers know ChatGPT 3 versus ChatGPT 4 versus ChatGPT 5, and then they’ll do 51, 52 or 41, 42 or whatever. So, it’s like software kind of versioning on these models. And whenever you see a new release, you’re talking a jump in terms of both sometimes the capacity to understand information, and they call that the token context windows. And then also their just natural built-in abilities of the things that they can do well. And so, some things they can do at a graduate level now, some things they can do, their novel ideas is still pretty low down the chain in terms of what they can do around original thinking. But they have all these benchmarks, so they have probably 15 or 20 different benchmarks that they run it against. Can it complete the bar exam is one, right? And so, now they’re able to do it, and then now the question is how quickly can they do it in? It would take them 25 minutes before now it’s five minutes. So, then there’s a bunch of inference side of benchmarking as well. So, we’re seeing Gemini 3 came out just a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic. And I will say that I called NVIDIA on here way back in the day. It was 1.8 trillion I think back in the day when I said, “Hey, I think this is going to run, when you and I were talking about it,” and it did because I knew GPUs were just going to be the most precious commodity we have as technologists. I have seen that Google now is in the driver’s seat here and I’m really excited for them because one, I worked at Google, they acquired one of my companies and I spent a few years there. And I’ve seen inside the belly of the, and I will tell you that they were built for this day and age, the fact that they’ve been training their entire life for this moment. They have all of the PhDs and all of the folks that they need to go pull this off across the entire suite. And so, what do I mean by the entire suite? And this is where it gets really interesting, Tim. If you think about what OpenAI has to do to compete, they have to go and buy up as much data center space as possible, and they have to buy a shit ton of GPUs from NVIDIA. That’s what they need because they don’t own the stack. They own the software, the training, the engineering, the soft good side of the business, but they don’t own the hardware side. This is a fantastic, really interesting stat. When Gemini three came out a couple weeks ago, it was the first time they had trained a frontier model. The best of best when it dropped, it was the best model in the world exclusively on Google chips. So, they have these chips called TPUs, tensor processing units. They have the full stack dude, they don’t even need NVIDIA. It’s wild. They didn’t use an NVIDIA chip to train their AI and they have world-class AI. So, it’s just really exciting. This is such a fun time to be alive because right now, you can take someone that is a technologist in the sense that they have a rough understanding of the available tech that’s out there, and you could build and produce and ship any app that you want within a few days now with what we have, and it’s just going to get better and better. So, the creativity and the shipping unlockments that we’re about to see over the next five years is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. If you have the idea for an app or a product or service, anything digital, you will be able to take it from ideation and drawing it on a piece of paper to actual shipping something to your customers within, call it less than a week, which is just never been done before at a price that is, I don’t know, $500, right? And so, if Tim wanted his own app five years ago, I’d have been like, “Okay, great. You want the Tim Ferriss fan site/ed help app, then to build that would be 50 grand,” right? Tim Ferriss: I feel like you have a problem that we need to talk about. You’re just bringing it up so much. After that half a glass of champagne, I feel like — Kevin Rose: It went straight to my head, number one and number two — Tim Ferriss: Turning into a mini confessional here. Kevin Rose: We need to talk about your relationships because one of the things that whenever I get on — Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy. Kevin Rose: No, I’m telling you whenever we do a Random Show, people are always like, they send me messages and they’re like, “I love how you give him shit, number one, and number two, we want to hear more about his personal life.” And I know you’ve got a new special someone in your life, which I’m very excited for. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that. Yeah, nice segue. Kevin Rose: Let’s jump into that. Now that we’ve covered Google, let’s jump into your personal life. Tim Ferriss: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to ask you for a counterpoint on a previous, I wouldn’t call it necessarily a prediction, but we talked about, I think it was in the last episode of The Random Show, a bit about venture capital. And I wouldn’t say that you said across the board, venture capital would be dead because there are capital intensive businesses that require — Kevin Rose: Yeah, hardware. Tim Ferriss: — hardware and build out and wet labs and all this stuff. But I’m wondering if I just put on my future vision goggles, which I wish I had, but let’s just pretend I do and I look forward, it doesn’t need to be five years. I look forward two years. And what you are describing is a reality, right? The barrier to entry, the hurdle is so low that suddenly from ideation to product takes a week. And there is an absolute glut, this just overwhelming tsunami of products. Now, on the positive side, yes, what would’ve cost people millions and millions of dollars to do 10 years ago, let’s say, 15 years ago, suddenly AWS and rentable infrastructure comes along, that cost goes down. Now AI comes along, cost further goes down. Kevin Rose: Sure. Tim Ferriss: But I imagine the war for attention is going to get so incredibly expensive. Do you think that products that get traction will nonetheless, if they don’t have the income stream to support it, raise venture capital purely for a marketing war chest and customer acquisition? I’m just wondering if you think you could make the argument that the customer acquisition costs are going to get, or user acquisition costs are going to get so high because everyone, you’re going to have a hundred X the number of bidders now who knows what the form will be. I don’t know if it’ll be Google AdWords, maybe it’ll be something else. What are your thoughts? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think, well, there’s a couple things there. The best products I’ve ever invested in, period, full stop, have been ones that don’t rely upon paid acquisition to grow. So, they have come up with something that is unique and novel enough to where word of mouth is their number one driver. That said, capital and deployed the right way and spent the right way around. Ad purchases is just fuel for the fire, which is great. And so, the thing VC is dead in the sense that the seed round was like, “Okay, I have a idea-ish. I’m going to go out and take $3 million and I’m going to give away 20 percent of my company.” What happens in the future is not that you don’t need that capital, because I think you’re right. You will need it for a variety of things. If you’re hitting insane scale, there will be moments where you need to put more warm bodies in seats to help you do all the things, and you may need to raise venture. But the difference is when you have product market fit, you go from raising and selling 20 percent of your business for $3 million to selling 20 percent of your business for $15 million, which is just fantastic for the entrepreneur. So, it’s not that venture is dead, it’s just that what we’re going to see is the entrepreneur is in control like they’ve never been before, which is fantastic. And if they say, “Okay, I’m off to the races and things are going so well, but guess what? I’m actually charging for my product and I’m breakeven.” You don’t ever have to raise VC. And then now you own a hundred percent of the business and you’re a Jason Fried, which we know is one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs of our time that invented SaaS that just has never taken any external investment. And you are just happy and you don’t report to anyone, which is a beautiful thing as well. Tim Ferriss: So, do you think it’s just like the killing fields for early stage folks and the value capture just gets pushed to later and later stage. Kevin Rose: Pushed out. Tim Ferriss: Right? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think that’s right. And I think largely on just tech, that is it’s understandable by AI. Meaning, if you’re running TypeScript or any of these languages that AI can figure out and write high quality code for, you just don’t need to raise capital. You can do it nights and weekends on your own. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Amazing. Okay. So, is it fair to say if you had to bet on one horse in the AI race that you would bet on Google? And then I have a follow-up question. Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: Well, now I know a little bit too much behind the scenes. If you had no stake in any companies, how would you please — Kevin Rose: Well, I never answer like that. I would always give you the true answer, even if I didn’t — Tim Ferriss: No, I know. I’ve got to say it, but yeah, where would you put first, second, third bet? Kevin Rose: Honestly, these valuations, I wouldn’t put a single dollar into the top three or five, largely because what are you going to do? Is Google going to 3X in the next 10 years? Tim Ferriss: Well, also, it remains to be seen how much AI cannibalizes their current money-printing machine in terms of search and sponsored ads and so on. Kevin Rose: I’m less worried about that because they own the largest distribution platform on Earth, which is Android. And so, they will find a way in there. And then also I think if Google had to pick their poison and say, “Okay, you can either base the future business off a $25 a month pro subscription to Gemini or a free account that is just ad-driven,” I think they’ll take that hybrid model all day long. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good point. Interesting. Okay, so you wouldn’t put any money into the big ones. So, do you choose then? Are you trying to find Amazon in 1998, 1999, right? Just in the absolute noise of — AI slop doesn’t just apply to Sora, it also applies to startups, right? There’s so much bullshit floating around. Some of it’s dressed up in very fancy clothing with fancy names, right? So, if you’re investing in AI writ large, how do you even — I mean, this is your job, right? Kevin Rose: I think there’s three buckets. I think there’s three buckets. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have to think about it. Kevin Rose: One is power. Without a doubt, we’re all going to need power. Small nuclear reactors are going to be a thing. The United States needs 3 to 5Xs power capacity in the next decade, if not more. And there is going to be a huge push into energy. So, there’s a bunch of plays there. You can look them up. There are even ETFs that track bundles of nuclear-related companies that are out there. That’s one play. I think power is without a doubt, the most important piece of this. And then data centers. There’s publicly traded data center companies out there. There are the bigs like Microsoft and Google and Amazon that are just expanding as fast as they possibly can and buying up land all over the United States. There’re always going to be a premium on that. They’re going to need that. NVIDIA, they’ve got competition from AMD, they’ve got competition from Google now. Obviously, they have such incredible tooling on the software side, there’s a lot of defensibility there. It’s a name to own. Would I buy in today at today’s prices? I don’t know. But I will say that if you think of this, less about, I’m just going to pick one horse and more like I’m going to pick a basket of things, these are the things that I would be putting into that basket. And then lastly, I would take large companies that have insane bloat from headcount that can be automated in the next, call it two to three years, where they will reduce sadly, and I hate to see this happen, but it’s going to happen no matter what. They’re going to reduce their headcount. They’re going to automate with AI and their profit margins are going to go through the roof. And I think those companies will reap the benefits of efficiency that comes from AI and their stock prices will as well. Tim Ferriss: How do you identify companies that have the most bloat with also the fewest hurdles to adopting AI for what you’re describing, right? Because some of them, they may be, who knows, just put in a position where from a process or regulatory perspective or whatever, they just can’t do it, at least in the near term. Kevin Rose: Yeah, in the near term, it’s listening to earnings calls and it is, I want to hear the CEO e saying that they are absolutely forcing their engineers to use AI forcing. You have to be, it is not optional at this point. To ask your engineers to play with it, you have to be using it every single day in your workflow. And the folks that are doing that, even though it’s not perfect today, they’re going to reap all the benefits 12 to 18 months from now. And so, that’s what I’m looking for more than anything else is who is wise enough? Because a lot of the CEOs are old. Who is wise enough to say it’s true, we know these folks and they just don’t — If you ask them the difference between Haiku 4, 5, and Sonnet, they would have no idea how to tell you. If they can’t answer those basic model related questions, what are you doing? So, it’s finding those people like the Jack Dorseys in the world and the folks that are just like — well, I wouldn’t want to say young because I want to be Asian, but they have to be leaning into this in a way that they have to believe that their entire business is going to be rebuilt from the ground up over the next, call it five years. And you have people like Salesforce, CEOs doing that. Obviously, Benioff’s on board with this. There’s a handful of folks that have said, “We are making sure this is a mandate from the top down.” Google did this quite well where they had this red alarm, or thing that they called off probably three years ago, where it said it is all hands on deck AI and Apple did not do that. And now look what’s happening. Most likely, Apple’s going to end up licensing Gemini from Google. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Wild world out there, kids. Wild world. Kevin Rose: Yeah. It’s a fun time to be alive, man. It’s fun to be playing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. Let’s see. I figure I could give people some maybe holiday gift ideas just in case they’re — Kevin Rose: Oh, yes, I’ve got some great ones. First thing I can recommend, something you can fit in your pocket. So, this right here looks like a golf ball with little, not quite spikes, but studs on it. They’re flattened. This is called a Rubz ball, R-U-B-Z, and I travel with this. You just roll out your feet on this before you go to bed and I have felt this helped everything from relaxing and just winding down. What I have noticed, and this is something I spoke with Ed Coan about a hundred years ago, long time ago. He’s the greatest powerlifter of all time, phenomenal athlete and very nice guy. But basically if you address your feet, sometimes you feel it all the way up the kinetic chain, your forelegs, knees, even your low back can sometimes release. So this, I think it cost less than 10 bucks. This is a Rubz ball. You can buy it on Amazon anywhere else. That’s a very easy one. That’s just pocket sized. We can go back and forth. What have you got? What you — Kevin Rose: Yeah, let’s do it. Okay, so this one is awesome, dude. You have my doc that I sent you right with the links to everything? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I do. Kevin Rose: I don’t know if you have it up in front of you. So, if you click on the second one down these bonsai Nanoblocks. So, I’ve been talking about Nanoblocks for a while. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you are. Kevin Rose: Hear me out, dude. This is a fun stocking stuffer. People are going to love this shit. So, it’s $38. It’s these little baby bonsai trees. Nanoblocks are like LEGOs, but they’re like one 10th of the size. So, you need tweezers to assemble them. It is oddly satisfying to build these little tiny bonsai trees. You get all six of them for $38 and if you use the code, Tim — no, there’s no code, but they’re amazing. They’re so fun. Anyway, Nanoblocks are awesome. This is a little fun little pack, great stocking stuffer. They’re super tiny and they’re cute. Look, there’s Nanoblocks up there behind me. See that beautiful tree? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. There it is. So you recommended a book to me. Do you want to mention it? It’s last in your list. I bought the audiobook and I listened to it on my flights recently. I thought the narrator was really, really good also. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s called Stop Fixing Yourself: Wake Up, All Is Well. It’s by Anthony De Mello, who we were talking about the Jesuit priest and therapist that we talked about earlier. Tim, we had both somehow discovered this book originally. Not this book, but the other one we’re talking about. Tim Ferriss: Awareness. Kevin Rose: Awareness. And it was really cool to hear that you were into it because it was one of my favorite books that we did not compare notes and we read this independently. I don’t know how the hell that happened, but we both loved it. And this is another one where I was just like, “This is so good because there’s so many core truths here that apply to my practice on the meditation side and I just loved it.” But it does require a little bit of understanding. It’s not like someone from off the street can totally read this and be like, “Oh, that makes a ton of sense to me.” I don’t know if you felt that way. Tim Ferriss: I feel like, well, there are two things I would say. Just having read a lot of Anthony De Mello that I think Awareness, subtitle, Conversations with the Masters, it used to be The Perils and Promise of Reality, but they changed the subtitle. I preferred the old one, but Awareness by Anthony De Mello. His last name is two words, D-E M-E-L-L-O is 184 pages and I’ve gifted it to at least 50 people. I mean, I have an entire bookshelf full of this book in my guest bedroom at my house just to give friends. Kevin Rose: Yeah, same, dude. It’s so funny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I would recommend people read Awareness first. I don’t think you need anything special in terms of background for that. Kevin Rose: Well, you do need one thing. You need to know that it is a lecture, so it reads like a lecture. It doesn’t read like a book. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which I like, which I like and he’s very no-nonsense. Kevin Rose: I gave it to a couple of friends and they started reading it and they’re like, “Wait, is this a talk that he gave?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, yeah, I should have told you that. It’s an actual talk.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a collection of polished lectures that he gave. So, Awareness would be the first. And then in the case of the Stop Fixing Yourself, I really enjoyed it. There’s a lot of overlap with Awareness. So, there are certain points that get reiterated. The audiobook rendition of Stop Fixing Yourself is very, very good. I disagree with some of the conclusions which are effectively along the lines — I shouldn’t say, this might sound unfair, but in the conclusion, he talks about how ultimate freedom is not depending on anyone for anything and you could be perfectly happy in isolation by yourself. And I was like, “Evolutionarily. I think that’s actually a pretty hard sell.” But what I would suggest is if you listen to or read these books, as with any book, expect that you’re going to disagree with and maybe even discard 10 percent, 20 percent of it, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. These are really, really helpful books. Kevin Rose: Well said. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, let me grab another one here. I’ll recommend two others in case people are interested in books. So, fiction, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. I think it might just be Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Anyway, it’s tomorrow three times by Gabrielle Zevin, Z-E-V-I-N. It’s a fiction book and it was on the New York Times’ list of the hundred best books of the 21st century. It’s a new one and it is all about entrepreneurship and game design and love unrequited. And when I recommended this book initially in 5-Bullet Friday, my newsletter, one of my attorneys who helped craft the agreement for Coyote, another stocking stuffer, the card game that I made which is 20 — Kevin Rose: Yeah, I know this is on a Black Friday sale, by the way, it’s 38 percent off on Amazon right now or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s 7.99 right now. It’s doing super well there. The reviews are great. It’s like 4.7 or 4.8 stars. Kevin Rose: Man, I’m so proud of you, dude. This is so cool to see you having success here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thanks man. Kevin Rose: I thought you were going to do The 5-Hour Body and I was like, “Ah, you probably shouldn’t go there,” and it’s nice to see you doing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, it’s been super fun. But my attorney, who helped with the negotiations on deal structuring for Coyote, specializes in video games and he’s been involved with some epic deals and amazing mergers and acquisitions and all this crazy stuff. And he texted me after I put that in the newsletter and he said, “That book is so good. It was eerie because it is so accurate down to the finest detail that it felt like somebody was looking over my shoulder when I was doing these deals.” That is how well researched this book is. You would love it. I really think you would enjoy it. Kevin Rose: My old assistant, Sarah, who’s amazing, she gifted it to me and it burned in the fire when my house burned down. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ve got to read it. Kevin Rose: But I need to get it because she was like, “You’ve got to listen to this book.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah, it’s great. And then the last one I’ll recommend just because we gave some nonfiction, then just gave fiction. I’ll give poetry, which people might not expect, but it’s a little tiny compilation. This also has an entire shelf in my guest room. It’s called Gold, it’s by Rumi. And then the translator, Haleh Liza Gafori, last name G-A-F-O-R-I, 112 pages. And it is just an incredible collection of poetry, of course, originally by the great Persian mystic Rumi, but with incredible new translations by Haleh Liza Gafori, who is an American poet of Persian descent. So, she’s a native speaker and also, she herself a poet and musician. So, if you read one or two of these poems before you go to bed at night, it just makes everything better. So I would also just recommend. I can keep going with gift recommendations, but I suspect you have more. I would like to mention anymore. Kevin Rose: Oh, I’ve got some great ones, dude. Yeah, absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t we do two at a time? Why don’t you do two and then I’ll do another two. Kevin Rose: Okay. I’m going to make you a multi-billionaire from how many people buy this next one, I’m going to say with your Amazon affiliate link. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: This right here, my friend, is the best purchase I’ve ever made in my life. Tim Ferriss: Whoa, that’s a strong statement. Kevin Rose: Okay, maybe not, but it’s high up there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, okay. Kevin Rose: Have you ever been in one of those situations where you need a small, little screwdriver or a screw head and you can’t find the right one that fits? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: This is 25 different micro, everything from hex nuts to screwdrivers to flatheads, and it’s a magnetic little insert into the actual one. Now you think, okay, who cares? But it’s $7.79 and it acts like a $25 screwdriver. It is the best stocking stuffer in the world. Once a year or twice a year you’ll get something where it takes two double As or whatever, and there’s a little, tiny screwdriver thing you’ve got to undo. Tim Ferriss: Totally. Kevin Rose: Where am I going to find something that fits that? This is that thing. And then when you want to tweak your glasses or whatever, you need those micro screwdrivers. Dude, $7, this thing rocks. It’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: How did you find this thing? Kevin Rose: It had good reviews on Amazon. I bought it and when I got it, I was like, they should be charging three times as much for this thing. The torque doesn’t actually ruin the bit heads, which is great because oftentimes with the cheaper ones, the bit heads get ruined. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: Anyway. You have to have it in every junk drawer in your house. It’s one of those things. But I love these things. Back in the day, when you were doing 5-Bullet Friday where you wanted me to contribute stuff, you would say, “Hey, what’s the best thing under $50, or whatever, that you love?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. This is it. Kevin Rose: This is one of those things that’s under $10 that is absolutely worth every penny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love it. All right. So under $10, I don’t know if it’s $10, might be a little bit more, but in addition to the Rubz ball, I’ll just give a couple of quickfire. There’s something called the Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. It was actually introduced to me by Nsima Inyang, or Inyang, I think is how he pronounces it, but you sent me his video, so you are responsible — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — for me ultimately connecting with him. But this Alpha Ball for rolling out your hips, for traveling with, it’s about the size of a softball, but it’s just the perfect density and texture, you can get everywhere you need to get, which you cannot do with a foam roller, nor is it easy to travel with a foam roller. I just love this thing. I use it pretty much every day. So, that’s the two — Kevin Rose: I didn’t see it on video. Did you hold it up? Tim Ferriss: No, I have it downstairs in my suitcase actually. But the — Kevin Rose: Okay, let me look it up. What’s it called again? Tim Ferriss: Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. You can find it on Amazon. It’s 19.99, more than worth every penny. I can send you a link to it, of course. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: Then other things I’ll throw in there, this is going to be one of those things. This is my version of your little TED talk that you just gave on the — Kevin Rose: Screwdrivers. Tim Ferriss: — $7 screwdrivers where people are like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” This is my version of that, which is the — I don’t know how to pronounce this, Maestri, M-A-E-S-T-R-I. Maestri House rechargeable milk frother. All right. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know. Right? Kevin Rose: Mine was better than that, but — Tim Ferriss: Hold on — Kevin Rose: Keep going. Tim Ferriss: — hold on, hold on. I have owned so many of these frothers for coffee, for tea, for whatever, protein shakes or whatever, these little hand frothers. They always — Kevin Rose: They all break. They all suck, dude. Tim Ferriss: They all break, or the batteries die and then you can’t recharge it, or it’s — Kevin Rose: Yes. Tim Ferriss: — like an outboard motor and you’re like, oh, let me just do this for my tea and relax, and it shoots liquid all over the place. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: There’s so many issues. This thing is like the Lamborghini of milk frothers. It costs — Kevin Rose: Ooh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It costs how much? 30 bucks. It’s not that crazy. Kevin Rose: It’s USB-C 2 charging. That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It’s USB-C. You basically turn the very top of it to adjust in any increment you want the intensity of the agitation. I have to tell you, I asked somebody on my team to just do diligence and get me a frother that would solve all these problems that I mentioned. He knows how to do a lot of research and this was his conclusion, and I got it and I was like, “Where has this been all my life? Oh, my God.” Has almost 3,000 reviews, or 2,600 reviews, 4.5 stars. This thing is just amazing. I use it every day. That’s one. When I put this in 5-Bullet Friday, what I wrote was, “It reminds me of Sage Wisdom from Kevin Kelly,” who is the founding editor of — Kevin Rose: Oh, I love Kevin Kelly. Tim Ferriss: — Wired magazine. Amazing guy. Kevin Rose: Yeah. We did a walk with him together. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. He had, at that time, I think it was a draft of a book that he put together, this tiny book called Excellent Advice for Living, which are these pithy little quotes from Kevin that he used to put in his — I think they were his birthday letters to friends where he’d be like, “Here are the 10 things I learned this year.” One of his pieces of advice is, “Take note if you find yourself wondering where is my good knife or where is my good pen. That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.” I have shelves full of shitty frothers that have been sent to me or that I’ve bought and they’re just terrible, so I just got rid of all of them and replaced them with this thing. Kevin Rose: That’s so awesome. Tim Ferriss: Other things, real quick: microphone. I got this microphone for travel called the Elgato, one word. Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, I love Elgato. Tim Ferriss: Elgato Wave:3. It is a gorgeous piece of design. It makes me think of Braun design back in the day, B-R-A-U-N, and it actually solves, somehow, bounce and echo better than even this fancy mic, this Shure mic that I’m speaking into right now. It is really impressive. I don’t know what they do with the firmware, software, whoever the hell designs these types of things, but this has become my favorite travel mic, is the Elgato Wave:3. Also, not that expensive. Kevin Rose: Have you seen their prompter by the way? They make a tiny, little prompter — Tim Ferriss: I haven’t seen it. Kevin Rose: — if you want to read scripts or anything like that. Oh, Elgato makes this beautiful, little prompt you can control with an iPhone or an iPad. For people that are doing monologues and podcasts and stuff like that, Elgato is some great gear and it’s not that expensive. It’s well priced. Tim Ferriss: This one, the Wave:3 — I’ll check out the prompter — it’s got almost 10,000 reviews, 4.7 stars, 150 bucks. I rely on it to the extent that I’m professional, a professional loves recording. There’s a lot more I could jump into. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give one that is expensive, but the best of breed, which is the TANK M3 push sled. This is a sled. It’s literally sitting right outside my door, about 100 feet away. I have tried so many different sleds for resolving back pain, for building all posterior chain development and strength, glute activation, you name it. Pushing and pulling a sled just gives you so many dividends. KneesOverToesGuy also talks about this at length, but the TANK M3 push sled is — Kevin Rose: Holy shit, it’s pricey. Tim Ferriss: — bar none the best sled I’ve ever used. Yeah. How much is it? Did you just pull it up? Kevin Rose: 1,500 on Amazon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 1,500. Yeah, 1,500 bucks. I would not — Kevin Rose: It looks amazing though. Tim Ferriss: I would not trade it. You can easily rotate it. It has mechanical resistance. For instance, I’m pushing it in a gravel driveway. It’s not just skids. You can use this on turf, you can use this on carpets, you can use it indoors without destroying the floor. It’s just an amazing sled. If people are looking for best of the best, in my opinion, and versatility, that’s one. And then if you don’t want more stuff or you want to give something to friends or family who don’t need more physical things — I am talking my book a little bit here because I’m involved with the company, but The Way App. It’s so easy, right? Kevin Rose: Henry’s the best, man. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to be doing hopefully another retreat in-person together. It started out as just my hand-down favorite meditation app. It’s the easiest way to get back in the habit. I just used it yesterday morning and this morning. I tend to do 10-minute sessions and then sometimes do an extra 10 minutes of TM or something after the fact. I think you can get 30 sessions for free with no credit card required — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — to try it out. And then if you want to give an annual membership, that’s 100 bucks. You can just download the app for free and then tap My Way and share it with people that way with a gift button. Kevin Rose: I’ll definitely add onto that. And I’ll say that I met Henry, the creator of The Way App, and he’s one of the very few Zen masters that are fully accredited in the United States. It is such a treat to interact with and have Henry as a guide and you get a pocket Zen master. I don’t want to sell this, but I will say that in the last — I started training with him in terms of meeting with him over Zoom during COVID, and now it’s been a few years, there is no better money spent in terms of — for me it has been more of retreats and things like that that I’ve been to of his. But meditation in terms of my just general anxiety and general way of moving through life, it’s been a game changer. It’s been a game changer. And Henry, I will give him a ton of credit there. One of the things that he told me early on, it still hits me today, is, “It’s not about, ‘Can I put in an hour a day of meditation?’ It’s better to put in just 10 minutes a day or five minutes a day and do it consistently than it is to try and achieve the mountaintop and go all out.” Can you just show up consistently? And I think if you do it for the first 30 days, you’ll feel it. You’ll feel it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ll notice something much earlier, in my experience. Henry has this expression, I’m going to paraphrase it, but basically if you do the practice, even if in some sessions you’re like, my mind is all over the place, I feel like that was a waste of time, “If you walk consistently in the fog, you can’t help but get wet.” is one of his expressions, meaning it compounds over time and even if you feel like individual sessions aren’t doing much, it does actually compound. If people want to keep it simple, you can find a QR code at thewayapp.com/tim and that’ll give you 30 free sessions with no credit card, so people can check that out if they want. What else do we have, Kevin? You have — Kevin Rose: I’ve got one more that’s fun. It is on the slightly pricier side. It’s a little over $200, close to $300. Actually, it’s a walking treadmill. My wife, Darya, turned me onto this. It is a very thin, tiny, little walking treadmill that has phenomenal reviews. You just throw it underneath your desk and for under $300 you can set the incline to 10 and it’s all with a little, tiny remote control. There’s nothing to hold onto, because you have your desk. You can just work and it rolls away because it only weighs 50 pounds, and you can just stash it in the corner. I think it’s the best walking treadmill. We did a bunch of research and it’s the best one under $300. Great way to get some exercise in there. Throw on a weighted vest there and you’re in a really good place. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, that’ll be plenty. I saw that when Darya was showing me her office. I was like, oh, look at that. There it is. Kevin Rose: That’s right. You got the tour. I wasn’t even home and you came over and stole my sleeping meds and — Tim Ferriss: Snagged your Belsomra — Kevin Rose: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: — took a spin on the walking treadmill and then took off. Yeah, I still owe you a trade for that. I do see in your notes, do you want to take a second and run people through Kevin’s current AI stack? This is all Greek to me, I don’t even understand what half of this means. Kevin Rose: Okay, real quick. I don’t know if you want to touch on New Year’s resolutions really fast — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s do it after the AI stack. Kevin Rose: AI Stack, one of the things that I’ve noticed is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the space is this idea of an AI assistant that is not your phone, but something that you can call when you need to remember something, when you need to take notes, when you — Tim, I was wearing that little pendant when you and I got together. Tim Ferriss: Hate it, hate it. Kevin Rose: It’s always recording, and Tim goes to me, he is like, “It’s always recording?” I was like, “Yeah.” And he goes, “I hate to ask you this, but can you just take it off? It’s too much anxiety for me.” So I had to take off that pendant and put it in my bag. But I agree with you, in that it is weird. It does cripple our conversations in our honesty when you know there’s something that’s listening all the time, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100 percent. Kevin Rose: A couple things, Nothing, the Android phone company, I’m not an investor or anything like that, they make headphones, which I’m wearing right now for this podcast. But one of the things that was really cool, when they released these headphones a month ago, they have a little talk button on the headphones. If you hold down talk as you’re holding your headphones case, I can record anything and it goes into their AI and it creates to-do lists for me, notes — Tim Ferriss: That’s cool. Kevin Rose: — whatever it may be. Tim Ferriss: That’s a cool feature. Kevin Rose: It’s just fun. Yeah. There was a company called Sandbar and we invested. True, it wasn’t my deal. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. Do you need to have an Android phone to use those? Kevin Rose: Yes, you need to have a Nothing phone. Tim Ferriss: Bummer. Kevin Rose: That’s the problem. But the idea is sound in that it’s not always on, it’s just when you need it, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep, yep. Kevin Rose: One of the things that Sandbar did, and I have one of their prototype rings around here somewhere. One of the things that Sandbar did is they created a ring, almost like an Oura ring, where if you just lightly touch it, you can whisper to any notes that you might want and it saves it in the AI cloud on your phone, Android OS, whatever. If you have headphones in, it’ll respond back to you. So like, “Hey. Remind me, what’s that meeting I have tomorrow?” just quietly. It doesn’t listen to the entire room, and then it gives you that data back in your headphones. Anyway. Sandbar is not out yet. It’s coming out middle of next year. I highly recommend sandbar.com, checking out. Like I said, it is something that we invest in at the fund level, but it’s not my deal. But I will say, I like where this is going. Even if it’s not Sandbar, something like this that is a little companion, that is not your big ass phone, that can be engaged with when you want to jot something down is quite cool. Outside of that, I would say AI on the Notion front has been quite good. The agents that they’ve added inside of Notion are phenomenal and that continues to get better. Tim Ferriss: What do you use that for? How do you use that? Kevin Rose: Notion, just added note-taking now. If you’re in a Zoom or any type of video call, it will automatically prompt you to record the entire thing. By default, I always say to people, Notion’s not actually recording the audio, but they are transcribing it, and they put the meeting notes and the bullet points into my Notion for me, and then I can ask questions of that transcript later on. Call it a week or two later, I’m like, “Hey, Tim mentioned some really cool book by Anthony de Mello, which one was it?” and it would, boom, right there, it’s within two seconds. That’s really cool. And then you can ask questions of your entire corpus of data. So, if you’re storing a bunch of stuff in there — I had my EIN number for one of my LCs and I’d be like, “Hey, what’s the EIN number for this LC?” Two seconds later, it’s out. That’s fun. Tim Ferriss: When do you think Gemini built into G Suite will be good enough to do that for an inbox? Kevin Rose: It is now. It is now. Tim Ferriss: Is it? Kevin Rose: Yeah, it is. Tim Ferriss: Because it was so disappointing as of even a few weeks ago. Kevin Rose: I just enabled it, this deeper integration. I don’t know if I’m a beta tester, but they let me in, and it does exactly what I just said. It’s within the coming weeks if I’ve happened to be on some beta list and whatever. Who will do this right now is actually the Gemini — oh, what are they calling it? It’s their AI suite where you can drop documents into it and everything. Everyone’s screaming it right at me. You know what I’m talking about, right? Have you played with this? Tim Ferriss: No, no. Oh, wait, are you talking about NotebookLM? No. Kevin Rose: Yeah, NotebookLM. Yeah, NotebookLM is getting better and better. Here’s a fun hack. This is a great one for your audience because they like your productivity, everything. One thing that’s really fun is, imagine there’s something you want to learn that’s new. Insert anything. You want to learn how to do basic Pilates. Go to ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever else and say, “Hey, give me a deep research guide on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and then you hit go. You wait five minutes, whatever, it gives you back a whole script. You copy that, paste it into NotebookLM, and say, “Create me a five-minute podcast on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and you have an instant podcast primer on that thing. I use that for coding technologies. I’ve used that for quantum computing. Tim, do you know how quantum computing works? Do you know how gates fold on each other when — Tim Ferriss: No. Kevin Rose: I didn’t. I dropped that in there and then you say, “Explain it like I’m five in a podcast.” Or not five, but you’d say, “Explain it like I’m a — Tim Ferriss: Fifth grader. Kevin Rose: — freshman in college.” Yeah, like I’m a fifth grader, whatever. I have aphantasia and I have no way to recall this later. It gives you this great, little podcast and it’s a fun, little way to learn anything new on the go. Tim Ferriss: I have to give a plug, and I am an investor in this company. It came up in a group thread. I don’t think he would mind me mentioning this. Our mutual friend, Chris Sacca, was like, “My daughter just taught herself about stock trading,” and this, this, and this. He took a screenshot and he’s like, “She created her own curriculum,” and — It was from a startup called Oboe. If people go to Oboe, that’s O-B-O-E.fyi, so oboe.fyi, it just says, “What do you want to learn about? We’ll make you a course.” You literally just type it out and it gives you everything in one place. Kevin Rose: Are you an investor in this? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m an investor. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: I noticed you had mentioned before — what was it? This would be fun for 30 seconds. When you were pitched this, because you were very — you say no to a lot of things, which is great, as every — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: — investor should. What was it about this that really hooked you in? Tim Ferriss: There were a few things. It was the people involved. I had some familiarity with the people involved and I had confidence in their ability to execute. Also, this is what I do, right? In the sense that if I have tried to hone any single skill, it is deconstructing and simplifying complex subjects, then putting material in some type of logical sequence, doing 80/20 analysis on the 20 percent of material that makes the difference, and the material beats method a lot of the time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I’ve thought a lot about this and I was like, all right, the thesis and mission of the company makes a lot of sense to me. Will they be the winner? I have no idea. That is a much harder question. That informs bet sizing and things along those lines. But I have a lot of confidence in the founders. The company itself was introduced to me, or the founding team behind it, by another founder who’s had exits, who is an investor, who’s a friend of mine. And I thought to myself, even if this just goes towards creating a product that I, myself will use — which is really where I start with a lot of my investing. Sometimes I succeed when I stray from that, but my hit rate is a lot higher when — say, in the case of Uber or Shopify or any of these other — Kevin Rose: Yes, it’s a core competence of yours. Tim Ferriss: Duolingo, these are — I know at least I am a market of one — Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: — for all of these products, and Oboe would fall in that category. That’s how I decided to invest. With these companies, it’s also not a bet-the-farm scenario, at least not for me. It’s you’re creating a portfolio with the recognition that 70, 80 percent of your investments are going to go to zero. But I try to answer the question, how can I win even if this goes to zero? How can I win? It’s if I help to in some way support a product and the development of a product that I use myself to learn a bunch of stuff quickly, then given the leverage that I think I can create or find in the world, it’s like, wow. If I have a smooth way, an elegant way to learn more about a few different — I’ll give you an example. If I’m considering, and I’ve already done this, if I’m doing due diligence on a company that I can’t talk about right now, but it’s innovating in biotech, and I want to learn as much as possible about different types of mRNA therapeutics, I’m not coming from a background that enables me to do that. If I then am able to do due diligence a hundred times faster because I’m not sending out 15 emails to people I think might be able to assist, and I’d still do that level of due diligence, but if let’s just say that 50 K investment allows me to then do due diligence in a way that allows me to place two or three other bets more effectively, I’ve very likely made my money back. Whether it’s with investing or choosing projects like the card game, Coyote, or anything else, my fundamental, underlying question is: Can this be a win even if it fails with, let’s just say, the primary external metric of sales or exit or whatever it might be? If I’m developing skills and relationships that snowball and transcend any single project, then that’s a vote in favor of doing something. oboe.fyi would fit into that bucket for me. It made me so happy to see Sacca’s daughter when she’s whatever, 12 or 13, creating her own course. I was like, okay, that’s a good sign that makes me happy. Kevin Rose: I just clicked on one of the things to create a course for me. It’s pretty cool because right away it said, “Do you want this in podcast format, which is seven minutes?” or, “Do you want this in lectured recording, which is 20 minutes?” Tim Ferriss: That’s awesome. Kevin Rose: That’s built into the product from step one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, from step one. And like you said, this is the blocky, brick, Motorola version. The rate of iteration for something like this is going to be so extreme, it’s going to be head spinning, so we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: I’m excited about it. Kevin Rose: All right, the moment you all have been waiting for, Tim’s girlfriend. Tim Ferriss: Thought I — Kevin Rose: Come on, dude. Tim Ferriss: Thought I got out of — Kevin Rose: No, no, no. People are — Tim Ferriss: I — Kevin Rose: They want to know what’s up with Tim’s personal life. Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to dox anyone who doesn’t opt into being doxed, so I’ll skip any identifying particulars. It’s getting serious quickly. She’s incredibly — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — sweet, incredibly self-aware, intelligent. For people who are wondering, of all places, met on Hinge. Have to kiss a lot of frogs or go on a lot of dates, it’s a lot of reps, a lot of swiping and a lot of noise to get to that point. But it did work. Kevin Rose: What was the first date like? Tim Ferriss: First date was Greek food, very chill, felt very much — I pay a lot of attention to this. You know that I have a very sensitive nervous system, and I just immediately felt down-regulated and at ease with her. That’s a lot. That’s not a small thing for me. Keeps me on my toes, is very funny, is very good at calling me on my bullshit. I’m optimistic. We’ll see. We’ll see. Super, super happy. Doing Thanksgiving together and — Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Family introduction time and all that shit? Tim Ferriss: Oh, she met my family already quite a while ago. It’s — Kevin Rose: I’ve only met her once. One final question then I’ll let you out the hot box. What is the hardest thing for you at this stage? Because you get to this point where there’s this honeymoon phase and then all of a sudden that starts to peel off and it’s in the nitty-gritty of life. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: What’s the hardest, most challenging part about this next, call it, six months? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know if I have the ability to predict, but my guess would be — I think what I’m about to describe is a plight of modern dating in general, at least as I’ve seen it among my friends and pretty much anyone who I’ve ever spoken to about this or if I ever mention modern datings in the app-based dating world. It’s such a game of roulette. The apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. I think the challenge for almost anyone who has been part of that playing field is when things get hard, when things are hard, when you have friction that lasts more than a day or a week, to stay the course and do the work necessary to resolve that as opposed to just being like, ah, fuck this, I’m just going to go back to the well. Kevin Rose: Because the well’s right there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: It’s 20 seconds away and a swipe away, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: That’s the downfall of these whole things. It’s so easy to move on to the next thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. They are all designed to be, of course, as addictive as possible. And even though they might say they’re designed to be deleted, by definition, since they have a fiduciary responsibility, a legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, their business model is entirely dependent on recurring revenue. So, they’re designed to keep you using the app as long as humanly possible. I don’t blame them for that. That’s just the way that this ecosystem works. But it is something to be aware of because they are seductive and they’re designed to be seductive, these apps, in every way conceivable. I would say that, step number one, take that stuff off your phone. And then number two is, fortunately I feel like over my last few long relationships — I’ve had some very long relationships. Five, six years in two cases — that I’ve developed a toolkit. I can always use more work and more refinement, but it’s like, do you have the basics of something approximating Nonviolent Communication? Do you ask for what you want and do you tell someone if they’re doing something that you don’t want? These seem like very obvious, self-evident things you should do, but a lot of people struggle with both of those, and then that breeds resentment or people bottle things up and then they explode and they say things they can’t take back. To what extent have you tried to mitigate those things? Do you have a toolkit? There are very good books out there, very good workshops. I’ve read a lot of these books and I’ve gone to a lot of workshops. As much as I’ve felt like I wanted to poke my eyes out with bicycle spokes at points in these workshops and seminars because I can only take so much of it — Kevin Rose: Same. Tim Ferriss: — they do help though. It could be something really small. And there are things you learn along the way, at least I have, as you get older, which is you can have almost anything you want in life if you discuss it openly and early. If you have weaknesses, if you have requests, if you have needs, if you have things that you value that are maybe weirdly out of proportion to most people, just talking about that stuff early sets the stage for success or at least communication. Very early on in this relationship, having conversations about conversations, if that makes sense, having open communication about how we’d like to communicate the challenges we have with communication. How we’re going to communicate, biasing towards honesty and being direct, even if you need to do a little bit of cleanup afterwards, has just saved a lot of brand damage. In this case, I think we both have very growth-oriented mindsets. I think both of us are pretty good at taking feedback. There are times when you’re just too sleep deprived or pissed off or bitchy or irritable, and you’re not good at taking feedback. You’re always going to have those days. But overall, I think we’re both eager to improve and we’re good at giving feedback in a way that generally doesn’t come off as too holier than now, judgmental. We’ll see, we’ll see. But in terms of the challenges, I think the challenges are always — I shouldn’t say always, that’s a big word. Man, so much of it just comes down to communication. Do you have the tools? Have you, say, read or listened to Terry Real? Have you both listened or read Terry Real so that you have some scripts or some shared language that you can use as shorthand? And — Kevin Rose: The problem I have with Terry Real is that if it’s taken too literally, it can sound formulaic. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: I don’t want to do the formula, let’s just talk, it can be a bit — Tim Ferriss: Here’s what I would say about that. I’d say that almost anything that works repeatedly is a formula. In the beginning, I think it’s important, as rote as it might seem, to — let’s just say the book, Nonviolent Communication, I think it’s Marshall Rosenberg, it’s a great book, but after a while you’re like, oh, my God, am I really going to say again, “When you did X, as a video camera would’ve recorded it, I felt Y. And the story I make up is X.” Kevin Rose: That stuff. “The story I make up…” kills me. Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. I know it kills you and — Kevin Rose: Stop saying, “The story I make up…” Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. As much as you might hate it, what you would hate more is, “Kevin, I fucking hate when you do X. It makes me feel Y, because you always do Z.” That’s worse, I think, right? You might be like — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — ah, with the formula, but the amount of damage you can do when you veer completely away from it is a lot. And then once you have the, I’d say, basic mastery or fluency with the formula, then you can deviate, right? Kevin Rose: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: Then you can start to deviate. But for instance, Terry, as any couples therapist, has certain frameworks and formulas. But there are also underlying philosophical principles that I think apply to a million different things that are outside of formulas. I’ll give you an example. One thing that Terry says — I think this is in Fierce Intimacy, which is an audio book, you can’t find a print version of it. I highly recommend it to folks. The point he makes is — it’s real simple — objective reality has no place in a relationship. What the hell does that mean? What that means is if you’re out at dinner and then the waiter comes over and the wife orders and then the waiter walks away and the husband’s like, “Honey, you don’t need to yell at him,” and she’s like, “I wasn’t yelling,” and then it turns into a whole bullshit argument about whether she was yelling or not. If the husband were to say, “Honey, actually I hired a professional audiologist with the latest cutting-edge technology and recording equipment, and they’re sitting right at the table next to us. If we accept the commonly defined threshold for yelling at XYZ decimals, if you look at these numbers, you can see that in fact you were, by scientific definition, yelling,” is that going to fix the problem? No, it’s going to be a huge fucking mess, right? Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: His point is the stories matter and the subjective matters and very — shorthand for that is objective — he may not word it exactly this way, but objective reality just doesn’t have a place in, let’s just say, an argument. We’re going to make mistakes. Occasionally, especially someone like me is going to try to appeal to some objective measure of God knows what. But if you can just postpone that judgment even for a minute or two, it just makes a world of difference, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Maybe it makes me sound like I’m really remedial in the EQ communication department. I actually don’t think that’s true. I think I’m pretty good. It’s like going to the gym, it’s like playing pool or shooting archery or whatever, it’s not a one-and-done thing, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you don’t practice these things, you will revert to whatever your parents did. Period. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I don’t want to model that. That was a goddamn mess. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I found that if my partner gets upset, just sitting down and saying, “Calm down.” is huge. Tim Ferriss: That works — Kevin Rose: It just works every time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kevin Rose: Or, “You’re being like your mother.” Those are things that are just really just home runs. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. “Why are you so hysterical like your mother?” Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Works like a charm. I think that’s Terry Real’s second principle. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Just say “calm down” and then you’re good, you’re good. They’ll be like, “Oh, I was being so crazy. You’re right. I should just calm down.” Tim Ferriss: I think also just expecting there to be bumps. There are always going to be bumps and — we’ll see, we’ll see. But — Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s been great so far. I feel super, super lucky, really, really fortunate. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I mean, you only date supermodels, so you should feel lucky. Tim Ferriss: That’s not true. That’s not true. Kevin Rose: I’ve met her. You have a supermodel on your hands. She’s great. Tim Ferriss: She’s very pretty, but she’s also very, very smart, knows how to adult, knows how to take care of things in the world. Which isn’t asking too much, but it’s surprising how many aspiring stay-at-home girlfriends you can find out there who have no intention of operating in the world. I feel very, very lucky, super, super fortunate. Kevin Rose: I’m excited for you, dude. Tim Ferriss: Yeah — Kevin Rose: Can we just spend some more time with her? Our first interactions were great. I’m excited to get to know her better. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, she’s incredibly kind, not a malicious bone in her body, but at the same time, hilariously blunt in some cases and sometimes not so hilariously blunt, but I’ll take it. It’s a package deal, I’ll take it. Kevin Rose: You’ve got a bit of that too though, right? So, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: I’ve got some of that. Yeah, I do too. I’ve got some of that, for sure. Kevin Rose: I’ve known enough of your ex-girlfriends to know that you’ve got a little bit of that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve got a little bit of that. It’s true. Oh, man. I think I’ve probably checked the box of talking about the girlfriend. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to have dinner very shortly. Happy Thanksgiving, man. Kevin Rose: Yeah, happy Thanksgiving. I would say the only thing on my side, just to bring people to speed on, is I have a new tech podcast that I’m very excited about that I’m going to launch in the new year. Kevinrose.com for my 4-Bullet Friday, which is a much faster read. No, I don’t — I only put out one email every month and a half or every — but it’s always packed with the latest AI stuff I’m playing with, all that stuff. Anyway. That’s my only plug of the show, is kevinrose.com, for the newsletter. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, check it out. Check it out, folks. We’ll hit New Year’s resolutions and stuff next time we do a Random Show. Let’s do it. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We’ll do that, because I need to dust mine off and blow the film that has settled on those and look at them in higher resolution, so I could use a little extra time. And we’ll — Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: We’ll get after it. Kevin Rose: Love you, brother. Always good to see you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love you too, bud. Kevin Rose: And thanks for sharing more of the personal side with us. Everybody gets a kick out of that and it’s always fun to hear your adventures. But I’m excited for you marching forward and I have good vibes about this one. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. It’s a fucking jungle out there. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Modern dating, it is simultaneously so fun if you hit your groove in a playing-the-field kind of way, but it’s also so incredibly exhausting and frustrating and can be very demoralizing. And — Kevin Rose: I don’t feel bad for you, honestly. I’ve gotten some of your texts. I think you had a damn good run. You had a good run. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m not complaining. I’m just saying I feel most at home, at ease, at peace when I am with my current girlfriend. It’s qualitatively a world of difference from just running around like some horny bastard with his hair on fire. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but — Kevin Rose: Not that there’s any hair left, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: Not that there’s any hair left. And also just be aware, whether you’re on X or Instagram, but especially on the dating apps because it is selling sex and things that are hardwired to hijack your attention, your faculties are being exploited to the maximum degree possible. It’s just something to be aware of. Really check your state before and after using these things to determine how much you might want to use them or if you want to put safeguards around how long you spend on these things. All right. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: Cool, brother. Love you very much. Please give a hug to Darya and the girls for me. Kevin Rose: Will do. Tim Ferriss: And — Kevin Rose: Same on my side. How’s Molly doing? Molly’s good? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s great. Yeah, Molly’s doing great. And — Kevin Rose: How old is Molly now? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s 10. I’m actually going to adopt a — Kevin Rose: Ah. Tim Ferriss: — puppy. I’m going to get a second dog next month. Super excited. Kevin Rose: Toaster’s 15 now. You saw him when you came to the house. Tim Ferriss: I did. Kevin Rose: I wasn’t there when you were there. Tim Ferriss: Oh. Kevin Rose: Isn’t he moving slower? It’s hard to watch. Tim Ferriss: He was. He also had just come from the vet and his paw was all taped up and he was — Kevin Rose: Oh, geez. Tim Ferriss: — drugged out of his mind — Kevin Rose: I know. Tim Ferriss: — when I saw him. Yeah, 15, he’s getting up there. Kevin Rose: I know. We gave him rapa, so I’m hoping for — I mean, we’ve already seen a 20 percent boost in lifespan, so we’ll see. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I need to get Molly on rapa. That’s going to be one of my tasks for December as well. One step at a time. Kevin Rose: Awesome. All right, brother. Tim Ferriss: All right, brother. Great to see you, bud. Kevin Rose: Great to see you. Tim Ferriss: Everybody listening, you can go to the show notes. We’ll have links to everything at tim.blog/podcast. Random Show, just look for the newest one and we’ll have it for you. Happy holidays, everybody. Thanks for tuning in. Kevin Rose: Happy holidays. Tim Ferriss: I’ll see you soon, Kevin. Take care, bud. Kevin Rose: Peace. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool. Critical is fine, but if you're rude, we'll delete your stuff.

Title: One Tech Tip: Up your Christmas shopping game with AI tools

AI-powered shopping assistants have become a staple in online retail, making shopping easier and more convenient Shopping assistant chatbots were a novelty a year ago. Now, they’re everywhere. After rolling out AI-powered assistants, online retailers and tech companies have been adding more artificial intelligence features to make online shopping easier and more convenient. The latest crop of AI-powered shopping services and tools made their debut in recent weeks, just in time to kick off the holiday shopping season that begins with Black Friday. Here’s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas: Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience. Walmart's Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant’s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it's only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the “Ask Ralph” chatbot to provide style recommendations. The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they’re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth. The results, in my experience, can be mixed. I tried Rufus recently to find a replacement aftermarket stainless steel pot for my rice cooker, as well as a protective trivet for my kitchen sink faucet. In both cases, the results weren’t quite right and didn’t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable. I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings’ pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results. Perhaps you don’t want to limit yourself to a single retailer’s website in your Christmas shopping search. Or you’re not sure where exactly to find that perfect gift. Tech platforms have rolled out AI-powered shopping tools that can cast a wider net by searching multiple sites. OpenAI added a new “shopping research” feature to ChatGPT last week that can provide personalized buying advice for products that are heavy on detailed specs, like electronics or appliances. The feature will activate if you ask ChatGPT a shopping-related question or manually turn it on in the chat window. OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer. Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they’re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an “intelligently organized response” based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info. Google added similar shopping features to its Gemini AI chatbot app for U.S. users last month. Meanwhile, Perplexity unveiled its own shopping assistant feature last week that can tailor recommendations based on previous searches. I asked all three to find a soft cotton flannel shirt. Both ChatGPT and Perplexity asked me for specific requirements, such as budget and must-have features. ChatGPT's response was the most detailed, with options from six brands including its top pick, and included pictures, prices and point-form summaries for each shirt. It also compiled the results into a comparison table. Results from Google, which didn't ask follow up questions after my initial request, felt the most general. Perplexity's results fell in between. So, you think you've found a stylish cardigan for your spouse. But you're not sure about the silhouette or vibe. Generative AI “try on” tools let users see what a piece of clothing might look like on the wearer. Existing virtual dressing room tools have relied on complex 3D rendering, real photoshoots and augmented reality. Often, shoppers were limited to picking a model that best fit their body type to see how clothes fit. Google is now tapping AI to allow shoppers to virtually try on garments and shoes using pictures of themselves in simple poses. Among the exceptions: accessories like hats or jewelry, bathing suits and lingerie. To use this feature, which is available through Google's shopping desktop search and mobile app in Australia, Japan Canada and the U.S., just tap the “Try it on” button on a product's photo and then add a full-length photo of yourself. You can then save the image of yourself with the tested item or share it. The original photo is also saved to your account so you don't need to keep uploading fresh images. If you're shopping for a gift for someone, Google says you can upload their photo, but only if you have their permission. Now that you've figured out what exactly to get for those special people on your Christmas gift list, it's time to buy. But if you want to outsource some of the legwork involved, there are “agentic AI” tools that can help. Amazon users can use an “AI agent” to buy a product on their behalf if the price falls to a desired level. Google has launched its own “agentic checkout” feature, which can automatically buy a product you're keeping an eye on with its price-tracking feature. Google's feature has rolled out to a small group of retailers, including Wayfair, Chewy and Quince we well as some Shopify merchants. Both companies say they'll always confirm with you before the AI agent makes the purchase. Amazon is taking it a step further by allowing shoppers to buy items that aren’t in stock directly from other brands’ websites. If you see a product on the Amazon Shopping app with a “Buy For Me” button, you can buy it through the usual Amazon checkout page but the AI agent will then carry out the transaction on the other brand’s website with your encrypted payment details. The feature was in test mode but is being rolled out more widely. Prefer to buy in person? It's a good idea to make sure a bricks-and-mortar shop has the product you want before heading over. Google has launched an AI service that will call local stores to ask. It's only available in the U.S. for toys, electronics and health and beauty products. When doing a Google search for the product you want, add “near me” to the end of your search query. Then, if you see “Let Google Call” when scrolling through the results, you can tap the “Get started” button. Answer some questions about what you’re shopping for, whether you want updates by email or text. Google will then contact stores near your location to ask if the item is in stock. The bot works swiftly but results might be limited. When an AP reporter in New Jersey asked Google to call around about a specific Acer monitor, the agent returned quickly with a reply from a local computer repair shop that sold refurbished monitors. It appeared to ignore nearby big-box outlets selling electronics. According to Google's text update, the local repair shop didn't have the monitor, but did have a similar-sized one — sans the other bells and whistles — for a lower price. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

Title: AI Mode, Activate; The Trade Desk Bends On Agency Incentives

AI Stat Padding Google and Meta love bragging about how widely their AI tools are being used by consumers. But are those metrics legit? For example, Mark Zuckerberg noted during Meta’s quarterly earnings in October that “more than one billion monthly actives already use Meta AI.” Wow! Sounds like a lot. Usage has also increased, Zuckerberg added, as the underlying models improve. But guess what? The basic search function on Instagram was recently replaced by Meta AI, and the app’s entire user base now defaults to that experience even if someone doesn’t want to use the feature. Meanwhile, Google is funneling people to its AI Mode for search regardless of their search engine preferences. As noted by Search Engine Roundtable, anyone who uploads a photo or document to Google is now sent to AI Mode by default instead of a traditional Google Search or Image Search. Meanwhile, in September, Google quietly began sliding a button into the Chrome URL address bar that directs queries straight into AI Mode rather than traditional search. The Defrayed Desk It’s been knives out for The Trade Desk’s 20% take rate all year. And now the largest independent DSP actually appears open to cutting its own fees. Although The Trade Desk historically has been inflexible in pricing negotiations, it’s offering agency discounts and incentives this Q4, Digiday reports. What’s changed? Mainly, increased competition from other top DSPs, Amazon in particular. Amazon DSP has been courting agencies with 0% tech fees for Amazon-owned media and 1% fees for third-party ads. Plus, TTD is under pressure to meet or exceed expectations this Q4, after missing its fourth quarter 2024 revenue guidance earlier this year. One indie agency buyer says TTD offered 1% to 2% discounts on ad tech fees for individual clients – if the agency committed to spending $500,000 more in Q4 than originally budgeted. Another buyer says they were offered post-auction discounts if they spent at least $750,000 in Q4. At the holding company level, one buyer says, TTD is making its development team available for working on tailored programmatic solutions free of charge. Another observes that TTD’s account reps are more responsive lately. All told, evidence is accumulating of an increasingly cutthroat DSP market. Open Up The Elsagates Good news: YouTube has finally found a reliable audience for the AI-generated content that’s been flooding the platform. Bad news: It’s toddlers (again). YouTube creators are increasingly monetizing by generating generic, low-quality AI slop videos intended for children, reports Bloomberg. The trend is particularly popular among entrepreneur-focused creators that make content about making money on YouTube, such as Monique Hinton and Isabella Kotsias. Both have posted videos specifically advocating that their viewers attempt to copy popular YouTube Kids trends and products, like “Baby Shark” and “Cocomelon.” This might trigger alarm bells for those who remember 2017’s Elsagate, a YouTube epoch marked by nonsensical videos of popular children’s characters (mostly Spider-Man and Elsa from “Frozen”) engaging in strange or disturbing activities. This “luridly-colored vomit,” as Forbes called it at the time, became enough of a problem that YouTube changed its community guidelines, purged thousands of videos and removed monetizable ads from millions more. Although, some might argue that these content farms didn’t disappear so much as move into new genres. But Wait! There’s More Let’s get real about agentic AI.

XRP extended its recovery with a clean push through $2.197 resistance, signaling renewed bullish momentum as institutional accumulation reappeared at key levels. XRP traded between $2.19 and $2.20 for most of the session before a brief liquidity sweep drove price to $2.15 during the largest volume event of the day. Buyers immediately absorbed the move, pushing the token back above $2.17 and maintaining higher lows on every subsequent retest. The breakout through $2.197 triggered a clean move to $2.206, supported by hourly volume rising from 450K to 553K. Price stabilized above $2.204 into the close while $2.22 emerged as the next resistance level to clear. Intraday momentum remained constructive, though upside continuation now depends on maintaining structure above $2.204 and avoiding deeper tests of $2.17. • The $2.204 micro-support is now the immediate pivot — holding above it keeps the breakout active• A break above $2.22 opens direct continuation toward the $2.33–$2.40 resistance band• Rejection at $2.22 combined with rising funding rates increases the risk of a leverage flush• Losing $2.17 would shift focus back to the broader $2.00 psychological level• Volume confirmation remains key — sustained prints above 600K/hour would support another expansion leg More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Solana, XRP, ETH Extend Losses as Bitcoin’s $91K Support Back in Focus The one-month chart shows BTC still locked inside a descending structure from early November’s highs, with the latest rebound producing another lower high.

Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit with host and journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Armstrong said recent moves on stablecoin and market-structure legislation signalled a shift in the policy landscape. “2025 is actually the year that crypto regulation went from kind of gray market to well-lit establishment,” he said. “The Genius Act passed, the House passed a market-structure bill in a bipartisan way that’s now moving on to the Senate, and I think that’s going to be the first one where the Senate passes it as well.” Armstrong criticized federal policy under the previous Biden Administration, saying it “unlawfully tried to kill this industry, which pushed a lot of activity offshore and hurt consumers.” “That’s why we’ve supported groups like Fairshake,” he said, referring to the crypto-focused SuperPAC. “Because 52 million Americans who have used crypto want to see clear rules on the books. All of our political spending is transparent.” During the 2024 U.S. election season, Fairshake raised over $78 million to support pro-crypto candidates, with eyes on the 2026 mid-term elections. When asked how he viewed past criticisms of Bitcoin by Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger, who had called it “nothing,” “rat poison,” likened it to a “venereal disease,” and predicted it would go to zero. Armstrong said there was “no chance” of that happening at this point." “For Charlie and Warren, they grew up in an era of American preeminence, where the dollar was everything, and you didn’t question it,” he said. “Bitcoin is this new digital gold, and people go to it in times of uncertainty. So it's tough for them to contemplate a world that is more decentralized and running on the internet.” During the interview, Fink spoke about how conversations with clients influenced his change of heart and the way he now approaches Bitcoin after calling it “an index for money laundering in the past. “I see a big, large use case for Bitcoin, and I still do today,” he said. “In my role, I see thousands of clients a year. I meet with governmental leaders, and we have conversations that evolve my thinking. This is a very public example of a big shift in my opinion.” Fink went on to say that while he sees a strong case for Bitcoin, he still sees it as “an asset of fear” in times of uncertainty. “You own Bitcoin because you're frightened of your physical and financial security,” he said. “The long-term reason you own it is the debasement of financial assets because of deficits.” During the panel, the question of stablecoins and bank anxiety over losing deposits to tokenized systems was raised, but Armstrong pushed back. “In that case, I think that's just the banks trying to protect their profit margin,” he said. “They should have to pay rewards and higher rates to their own customers, and they're trying to put their thumb on the scale of regulatory capture to prevent crypto from doing that.” Armstrong, instead, predicted that banks would soon start embracing stablecoins. “We're already seeing this,” he said. “My guess is that in a year or two, they'll come back and say they want to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in their own companies. “It goes back to the Innovator's Dilemma,” he said. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity, and the ones fighting it are going to get left behind.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Polymarket Bettors Still Expect Big Strategy Buys Even as Saylor Prepares for a Weak Market
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/04/asia-morning-briefing-prediction-markets-still-expect-big-strategy-buys-even-as-saylor-prepares-for-a-weak-market

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.A new CryptoQuant report suggests that Strategy is quietly preparing for a multi-month BTC downturn. This thesis is colliding with prediction markets bets that still believe the company will behave as if it were 2021. CryptoQuant highlights in its most recent weekly report that Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury company is undergoing a structural pivot from aggressive BTC accumulation to balance-sheet protection, highlighted by a separate USD reserve and language acknowledging the option to hedge or even sell in stressed conditions. Despite that shift, Polymarket odds for a bitcoin sale remain marginal for the first quarter of the year, while expectations for routine small buys stay elevated. Additionally, Polymarket traders still see routine MSTR purchases as a high-probability event, even as the scale of those buys shrinks. The market assigns only a 40%–45% chance of a buy above 1,000 BTC, and the CryptoQuant report suggests these cosmetic top-ups are becoming the norm. With monthly accumulation down more than 90% from last year, traders expect small buys that preserve branding without affecting supply or regional liquidity. Strategy’s average purchase size has fallen from 15,133 BTC in 2024 to 5,330 BTC this year, and with DAT inflows at their weakest since mid-June, bitcoin treasury firms are no longer absorbing meaningful supply in the current market. Taken together, slower treasury buying, weaker DAT inflows, and a more defensive MSTR suggest a different supply landscape ahead for crypto in 2026. Whether BTC can resume its upward trend will hinge on new sources of demand stepping in to replace the corporate accumulation that defined the last cycle. BTC: Bitcoin recovered from its morning drop to $91,800 and steadied near $93,000, but its two-day 10% rally is stalling below resistance at the 2025 yearly open around $93,400. ETH: Ether climbed back above $3,100 and reached a two-week high near $3,200 after a 3.5% gain on the day. Gold: Gold slipped slightly to just above $4,200 as traders stayed cautious ahead of key U.S. inflation data, although renewed Ukraine tensions and a softer dollar outlook could set the stage for a rebound. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks traded mixed Thursday, though Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix rose about 1.3% after upbeat U.S. jobs data lifted Wall Street and strengthened hopes for a Fed rate cut next week.

Title: Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-04T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move. Failure to reclaim $102K, however, risks renewed selling pressure and a potential retest of the $86K region.

Title: Axon Tests Face Recognition on Body-Worn Cameras
URL: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/axon-tests-face-recognition-body-worn-cameras
Time Published: 2025-12-03T23:51:11Z
Full Content:
Axon Enterprise Inc. is working with a Canadian police department to test the addition of face recognition technology (FRT) to its body-worn cameras (BWCs). This is an alarming development in government surveillance that should put communities everywhere on alert. As many as 50 officers from the Edmonton Police Department (EPD) will begin using these FRT-enabled BWCs today as part of a proof-of-concept experiment. EPD is the first police department in the world to use these Axon devices, according to a report from the Edmonton Journal. This kind of technology could give officers instant identification of any person that crosses their path. During the current trial period, the Edmonton officers will not be notified in the field of an individual’s identity but will review identifications generated by the BWCs later on. “This Proof of Concept will test the technology’s ability to work with our database to make officers aware of individuals with safety flags and cautions from previous interactions,” as well as “individuals who have outstanding warrants for serious crime,” Edmonton Police described in a press release, suggesting that individuals will be placed on a watchlist of sorts. FRT brings a rash of problems. It relies on extensive surveillance and collecting images on individuals, law-abiding or otherwise. Misidentifications can cause horrendous consequences for individuals, including prolonged and difficult fights for innocence and unfair incarceration for crimes never committed. In a world where police are using real-time face recognition, law-abiding individuals or those participating in legal, protected activity that police may find objectionable — like protest — could be quickly identified. With the increasing connections being made between disparate data sources about nearly every person, BWCs enabled with FRT can easily connect a person minding their own business, who happens to come within view of a police officer, with a whole slew of other personal information. Axon had previously claimed it would pause the addition of face recognition to its tools due to concerns raised in 2019 by the company’s AI and Policing Technology Ethics Board. However, since then, the company has continued to research and consider the addition of FRT to its products. This BWC-FRT integration signals possible other FRT integrations in the future. Axon is building an entire arsenal of cameras and surveillance devices for law enforcement, and the company grows the reach of its police surveillance apparatus, in part, by leveraging relationships with its thousands of customers, including those using its flagship product, the Taser. This so-called “ecosystem” of surveillance technologyq includes the Fusus system, a platform for connecting surveillance cameras to facilitate real-time viewing of video footage. It also involves expanding the use of surveillance tools like BWCs and the flying cameras of “drone as first responder” (DFR) programs. Face recognition undermines individual privacy, and it is too dangerous when deployed by police. Communities everywhere must move to protect themselves and safeguard their civil liberties, insisting on transparency, clear policies, public accountability, and audit mechanisms. Ideally, communities should ban police use of the technology altogether. At a minimum, police must not add FRT to BWCs. This post was written by EFF legal intern Alexa Chavara.Black box technology has no place in the criminal legal system.

The firm says that mega forces, or major structural changes that affect investments now and in the future, are changing the global economy. The most dominant mega force is AI, according to its 2026 outlook report. “With a few mega forces driving markets, it is hard to avoid making a big call on their direction – and as such, there is no neutral stance, not even exposure to broad indexes,” BlackRock’s report reads. “We remain pro-risk and see the AI theme still the main driver of U.S. equities. Yet this environment is ripe for active investing – picking winners and losers from among the builders now and later as AI gains start to spread, in our view.” The firm’s report also highlights the role of stablecoins in the “future of finance,” a mega force it says characterizes the changes in “how households and companies use cash, borrow, transact and seek returns.” That definition has now expanded to include crypto and stablecoins, a representative for the firm told Decrypt. “Stablecoins are no longer niche–they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” BlackRock’s Global Head of Market Development Samara Cohen said. The firm also sees the potential for stablecoins to grow beyond banking, indicating a potential role in cross-border payments and as alternatives to local currencies in emerging markets. The total stablecoin market cap has grown by more than $100 billion since this time last year, according to data from DefiLlama, with more than $307 billion in stablecoins—led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, now circulating. Despite their rapid growth, predictors on Myriad’s prediction market think it’s unlikely that the total market cap will spike to $360 billion by February. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) In addition to stablecoin growth, the firm pointed to the fragmentation of AI and defense, growing energy constraints for the AI build, and a new uneven phase for private credit as underlying themes impacting broader mega forces. Over the next six to 12 months, it remains committed to AI thanks to good earnings figures and healthy balance sheets, signaling AI favor as one of its “big calls” moving forward. “We stay overweight U.S. stocks on the broadening AI theme, with risk appetite supported by Fed rate cuts,” the firm wrote.

Title: Trump’s Ballroom Donors Blow Off Senator’s Questions About How Much They Gave

This year, the holidays don’t feel celebratory for many Americans who’ve been negatively affected by the Trump administration’s decisions. We’re here to make sure those people do not go unheard. Help us hold the administration accountable. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump released a list of private donors paying for the construction of his 90,000-square-foot, $300 million White House ballroom — and the demolition of the East Wing — he left lots of questions unanswered. How much money did these billionaires and corporate CEOs give? Who approached them about donating in the first place? Are they expecting something in return? Are they actively lobbying the White House for other perks for their businesses or themselves? Was this even a complete list of all the donors behind the ballroom project? (It was not.) Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, posed these questions to more than 30 of the known donors financing Trump’s ballroom project, in a series of letters that went out in late October. He gave them until early November to respond. The donors’ response letters, obtained by HuffPost, are remarkably evasive. The 21 responses ― two came from contractors on the project, the rest from companies that donated ― almost universally do not answer Blumenthal’s questions, instead boasting about their philanthropy and love of America. Blumenthal posed very specific questions, like, “What amount did you contribute to the White House Ballroom project?” and “Please list all White House personnel or other representatives or associates of the Trump Administration or Trump family with whom you have spoken about the donation.” Some of the responses were laughable. Apple, Amazon and Meta, who are among the Big Tech companies financing Trump’s project, said their support for the ballroom is simply another example of them donating money to a good cause. None actually said how much money they gave, or who they worked with in Trump’s orbit to make the donations happen. Meta unironically suggested it is financing the ballroom project because it cares about preserving the White House grounds — as Trump just razed the entire East Wing to make way for his project. (HuffPost obtained copies of the letters on the condition to not directly quote them.) Other donors, like cryptocurrency companies Coinbase and Ripple and major government contractor Booz Allen, similarly claimed their donations are motivated by civic pride and a commitment to protecting the White House. Booz Allen in particular hailed the White House as a symbol of American democracy and said it is proud to help support the building, part of which, again, Trump just completely demolished. The only company that divulged its donation in its letter was Google, and it only did so because it’s already been reported that it’s donating $22 million as part of a settlement the company reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube, owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, after he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Most of these donors insisted they are following all laws and aren’t giving money to the ballroom project in exchange for other perks from Trump. Some companies, including Comcast and BlackRock, claimed they blindly donated money to the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit partner to the National Park Service that accepts private money for repairs and upgrades to national monuments and grounds, and had no say in their funds going specifically toward Trump’s ballroom. Others, like Nvidia and the Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, confirmed they donated to the trust specifically to aid Trump’s project. One company that won’t be kicking in money for the White House ballroom is JPMorgan Chase. Its CEO, Jamie Dimon, said last month on CNN that the company has a lot of government contracts within and outside of the U.S., and it has to be careful about how its arrangements are perceived and how a future Justice Department may deal with them. “We’re quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like, you know, buying favors or anything like that,” Dimon said. Trump’s ballroom project is unpopular with the public. An ABC News/Washington Post survey from late October found just 28% of Americans backed the ballroom’s construction, with 56% opposed.

Title: Coinbase CEO Reveals Collaborations With Leading Banks On Stablecoin And Crypto Trading Initiatives

Leading banking institutions in traditional finance (TradFi) are reportedly partnering with US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) to explore pilots related to stablecoins, custody solutions, and trading options. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced this during his appearance at the New York Times Dealbook Summit on Wednesday, as reported by Bloomberg. Armstrong emphasized that leading financial institutions recognize this as an opportunity for growth. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity,” he stated, although he refrained from naming any specific banks involved in these initiatives. During his speech, the executive also voiced his concerns about institutions that resist participating in the digital asset ecosystem. He asserted that those who oppose it will be left behind. This sentiment aligns with remarks Armstrong made six months ago, where he predicted that eventually, every major bank would integrate cryptocurrency into their operations. He views this technology as a means to modernize the financial system, stating, “We can power a variety of things for them.” He noted that some banks are looking for custodial solutions, while others are interested in developing their own stablecoins. Adding weight to this discussion, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer BlackRock, participated in the event alongside Armstrong. Fink, who previously voiced skepticism about cryptocurrencies, described Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe haven asset despite the cryptocurrency’s crash toward $83,000 on Monday. “You own Bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security. You own it because you’re frightened of your financial security,” he remarked. On the financial side, Coinbase’s stock performance reflects the positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market amid recovering prices. Trading under the ticker COIN on the Nasdaq, Coinbase’s shares closed Wednesday at nearly $277, marking a 5% increase. This uplift coincides with broader gains in the cryptocurrency sector, notably led by the recent price performance of Ethereum (ETH), followed by Bitcoin, XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and other notable tokens such as Solana (SOL), all of which have shown significant recoveries this week after a challenging month.

December 03, 2025 17:29 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to report shallow, high-grade confirmatory grade control drill results from the P17 Zone at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The P17 Zone is a high-grade hard rock deposit outcropping at surface located at the southern end of the Bomboré mining lease. In addition to several phased oxide pits, which have locally been advanced into the hard rock, the P17 Zone will be a primary mill feed source in 2026 for the new hard rock plant, currently being commissioned. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “The results of the near-surface P17 Zone grade control drill program were successful in confirming the P17 resource and reserve models. Furthermore, the results serve to underscore the high-grade nature and overall continuity of mineralization within the P17 Zone. This initial grade control drill program is centered on the first six months of planned production from the P17 Zone. Mining activities in this area of the pit are now underway, with mined ore scheduled to be fed to the mill in early 2026 once commissioning is complete. ___________________________________1. True widths of mineralization are between 75-80% of drilled lengths. Commissioning of the stage 1 hard rock plant is well advanced, with the jaw crusher now commissioned and a crushed ore stockpile established. The SAG mill is now turning, with grinding media being added and first ore through the mill expected to follow very soon. Water testing of the CIL circuit is now complete, with the tanks to be filled and fresh carbon to be added by the end of the week. Overall, commissioning activities remain on schedule, with first gold expected in the coming days. This is truly an exciting time for the Company, and I want to thank everyone involved for all their hard work and dedication. The commencement of production from the stage 1 hard rock plant represents a major milestone for Orezone, with overall gold production at Bomboré set to increase by 45% to 170,000 to 185,000oz in 2026. This will mark a significant cash flow inflection point, underscored by the Company’s solid balance sheet and record high gold prices.” Figure 1: Stage 1 Hard Rock Expansion Commissioning Figure 2: Bomboré Plan Map – Highlighting Location of P17 Grade Control Drilling and Associated Sections Figure 3: P17 Composite Long Section – Highlighting Location of Grade Control Cross Sections and Further Exploration Upside Down Plunge of US$1,740/oz Pit Shell (Looking West) Figure 4: P17 Grade Control Cross Section A-A’ (Looking North) Figure 5: P17 Grade Control Cross Section B-B’ (Looking North) Table 1: P17 Grade Control Drill Results * Mineralized intervals are reported as downhole lengths.

Grade control samples are generated from in-house and contractor-owed reverse circulation (“RC”) drill rigs using face sampling hammers. Samples were collected directly from a cone splitter attached to the rig-side cyclone at 1m intervals by Orezone employees. The samples are received at the on-site assay laboratory operated by Intertek, split to 1kg, pulverised and leached using the PAL-1000 method. The slurry sample produced is analysed using atomic absorption spectrometry (“AAS”) for gold giving a total cyanide extractable gold value. The leach residues from all samples with a leach grade greater than or equal to 0.25g/t Au were prepared by Intertek and split to 50g using RSDs. A 50g aliquot was analyzed by fire assay at Intertek Bomboré lab. Orezone employs a rigorous Quality Control Program including a minimum of 10% standards, blanks and duplicates. The composite width and grade include the final leach residue assay results for most of the drill intercepts reported.

Title: BlackRock’s Fink calls Bitcoin an ‘asset of fear’, softens crypto stance

Larry Fink spoke alongside Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, describing how BlackRock's stance on crypto had evolved over the previous eight years. Larry Fink, chair and CEO of asset management company BlackRock, explained his “big shift” from associating cryptocurrencies with illicit activities to having the largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Speaking at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Fink addressed questions related to his views on crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) from journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. The BlackRock CEO said his move from associating crypto primarily with money laundering to having exposure to billions of dollars in BTC was “a very glaring public example of a big shift in [his] opinions.” “My thought process always evolves,” said Fink. The CEO, who took the stage with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, was not entirely bullish on Bitcoin for the duration of the panel. Fink described Bitcoin as “an asset of fear,” noting that the price of the cryptocurrency had dropped amid news of a US-China trade deal and a potential end to the war in Ukraine. He added: Fink’s comments stand in stark contrast to those he made in October 2017, before Bitcoin’s well-known bull run that drove the price of the cryptocurrency to then all-time highs. At the time, the CEO said the cryptocurrency “shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” Related: SEC sends warning letters to ETF issuers targeting untamed leverage In the eight years since that message, BlackRock was granted regulatory approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch one of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, under the ticker symbol IBIT, reached a peak value of about $70 billion. Cointelegraph reported last month that IBIT experienced more than $2.3 billion in net outflows across November, including withdrawals of about $463 million on Nov. 14 and $523 million on Nov. 18. However, BlackRock’s business development director, Cristiano Castro, said at the time that the asset manager was confident in ETFs as “liquid and powerful instruments.” Among the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market are offerings from Grayscale, Bitwise, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and VanEck.

Title: Crypto bounces but weak US macro data, AI uncertainty threaten the recovery

Cryptocurrencies show strength despite investors’ concerns about the AI industry and weak US labor and consumer data. Would an acceleration of money printing boost Bitcoin? Key takeaways: Low BTC and ETH leverage appetite contrasts with strong stock markets, highlighting fragile sentiment despite improving liquidity expectations. While economic uncertainty persists, anticipated monetary easing reduces downside risk for cryptocurrencies, favoring a potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) gained momentum on Wednesday, rising to their highest levels in two weeks as investors await a more expansionist monetary policy. Weak economic indicators boosted expectations of fresh stimulus measures, increasing demand for scarce assets. The S&P 500 index and gold also reacted positively as investors anticipated higher liquidity entering the markets. Still, with the cryptocurrency market capitalization sitting 29% below its all-time high of $4 trillion, Bitcoin and Ether traders remain alert to the possibility of a correction driven by broader economic uncertainty. Demand for scarce assets strengthened on Wednesday, shown by the jump in US five-year Treasury prices and gold approaching $4,240, up 3% in two weeks. Bitcoin held near $93,000, unchanged from two weeks earlier. Ether, however, remains 37% below its all-time high of $4,956, prompting traders to reassess the outlook for the altcoin market. The US labor market showed signs of slowing in November as private companies cut 32,000 jobs, with small businesses facing the toughest conditions. The ADP payroll report noted that workers saw a 0.1% pay decline from October, which reduced inflation concerns. Traders now await the Fed’s interest rate decision on Dec. 10, expecting clearer guidance on policy direction. Fed policymakers have signaled diverging views, partly due to the lack of official US government data during the government funding shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. Some argue rate cuts are needed to prevent deeper labor market weakness, while others warn additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which remains well above the Fed’s 2% target. Growing dependence on artificial intelligence investments by some of the world’s largest companies adds another layer of uncertainty. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, reportedly said: “There is so much talk about the potential of the bubble… people are conscious of the risk.” According to Yahoo Finance, BlackRock also highlighted the physical limitations of large-scale AI data center expansion. The US department store operator Macy’s said Wednesday that its outlook reflects ongoing pressure from cautious consumer spending and higher tariffs, which are expected to weigh on results in the final months of 2025. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said Macy’s has been forced to make “selective” price increases across most categories. Demand for bullish leverage positions on Bitcoin and Ether remains unusually low. Under neutral conditions, the annualized funding rate on perpetual contracts should fall 6% to 12% to cover the cost of capital. This lack of conviction is notable given that the US Russell 2000 Small Cap Index sits just 2.3% below its all-time high. Related: Ethereum treasury trade unwinds 80% as handful of whales dominate buys The stock market is expected to benefit directly from expansionist monetary policies through lower capital costs and government incentives tied to AI and nuclear energy infrastructure. Without a shift in sentiment, cryptocurrencies may continue to lag as job market conditions weaken and uncertainty builds. Despite the soft labor and consumer data, cryptocurrencies are not at imminent risk of collapse. The expected liquidity boost should help ease economic pressure and sustain appetite for scarce assets. As long as monetary conditions continue to loosen, Bitcoin and Ether are more likely to recover modest ground than face a sharp reversal.

Title: Major banks running stablecoin, crypto-trading pilots with Coinbase, Armstrong says

At the DealBook Summit, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink acknowledged Bitcoin’s utility, as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong said the exchange was running pilots with major US banks. Major US banks are running early pilots involving stablecoins, crypto custody and digital-asset trading in partnership with Coinbase, CEO Brian Armstrong said onstage at The New York Times DealBook Summit.According to Bloomberg, Armstrong didn’t identify specific institutions but warned that banks slow to adopt crypto “are going to get left behind.” His remarks were made during a joint appearance with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel at the event. Although Armstrong and Fink haven’t always aligned on crypto, the two struck a notably similar tone on Bitcoin. Armstrong dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could ever fall to zero, while Fink said he now sees a significant “use case” for the asset, though he did caution that Bitcoin is “still heavily influenced by leveraged players.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched in January 2024, is now the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with a market cap of over $72 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. BlackRock also issues the largest tokenized US Treasury product by market cap, currently managing around $2.3 billion in assets, according to data from RWA.xyz. Related: Identity checks to power AI stablecoin payments added to Coinbase-incubated x402 Despite Brian Armstrong’s comments that Coinbase and some major banks are collaborating, the relationship has become more adversarial in recent months. In August, the Banking Policy Institute, a lobbying group chaired by JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, warned Congress that stablecoins could undermine the banking sector’s credit model. The group urged lawmakers to tighten the GENIUS Act, arguing that a capital shift from fiat deposits into stablecoins could increase lending costs and reduce credit available to businesses. Traditional banks are primarily concerned about what they perceive as a “loophole” in the US GENIUS Act, which bans stablecoin issuers from offering yield, but allows third parties, such as Coinbase, to do so. In September, Armstrong told Fox Business that Coinbase aims to replace traditional banks by becoming a “super app,” offering everything from credit cards to payments and rewards. He also called the traditional banking system outdated, pointing to the “three percent” fees charged every time people use a credit card. Banks have also pushed back directly against Coinbase. In November, the Independent Community Bankers of America urged the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to reject the exchange’s application for a national trust charter, arguing that Coinbase’s crypto-custody model is untested.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Tells Joe Rogan AI Race Is Real, But It Won’t Have a Clear Winner

Time Published: 2025-12-03T20:08:28Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t think the artificial intelligence race will be decided in a single breakthrough. On The Joe Rogan Experience, Huang cast AI’s acceleration as the latest chapter in a long-running global competition for technological advantage, one that has repeatedly redrawn geopolitical lines, from World War II through the Cold War. “We’ve always been in a tech race with someone,” Huang said, likening today’s push for AI leadership to the Manhattan Project. The difference, he argued, is tempo: rather than a sudden, decisive finish line, AI will advance in waves, continuous gains that are easy to miss in the moment but obvious in hindsight. That doesn’t mean the stakes are modest, according to the CEO of one of the biggest manufacturers of the the chips AI firms need to operate. Huang said AI systems have become roughly 100 times more capable over the last two years, a rate of progress that has fueled public anxiety about autonomous weapons and machines operating beyond human moral constraints. Huang’s counterpoint: much of the momentum is flowing into functionality and safety, making systems more reliable, more useful and less error-prone, he claimed. He also defended the U.S. military’s role in AI development, suggesting that defense involvement can normalize the technology’s place in national security rather than leaving it to shadowy, unaccountable actors. Rogan pressed on a familiar set of fears: AI outpacing human judgment, and the longer-term threat that quantum computing could crack modern encryption. Huang pushed back, arguing that AI will remain “a click ahead," and that history is full of moments when society panicked over its newest inventions, only to adapt once the technology became legible and regulated. If Huang has an ideal end state, it’s not a single winner hoisting a trophy. It’s something quieter: AI becoming infrastructure, fading into the background as it powers everyday systems, from healthcare to transportation, less a conquering intelligence than a new layer of computing people stop noticing because it simply works.

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink identified rising US national debt as a potential driver for broader crypto adoption today, suggesting digital assets could serve as alternatives if fiscal concerns undermine dollar dominance. Fink, who oversees BlackRock’s investment strategies, highlighted how uncontrolled US deficits could position Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable options beyond traditional dollar-based holdings. BlackRock has expressed concerns that increasing US national debt could impact conventional assets such as US Treasuries, while pointing to growing institutional interest in crypto assets as an alternative investment class. The firm has also emphasized tokenization as an emerging technology with potential to reshape the financial system’s infrastructure in coming years. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Bank of America predicts an ‘air pocket,’ not an AI bubble, fueled by mountains of debt piling up from the data center rush

It’s not the year 2000, and there is not an impending tech bubble, but that doesn’t mean investors shouldn’t be bracing for turbulence, Bank of America Global Research says. Savita Subramanian, BofA head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, has been arguing that compared with the dotcom era, today’s AI boom has supported earnings growth and smaller IPOs, and “speculation in unprofitable stocks is less extreme.” However, she warned, aggressive capital expenditures from hyperscalers are increasingly relying on debt, presenting danger for investors still eagerly awaiting returns. “Is this 2000? Are we in a bubble? No,” Subramanian said during BofA’s outlook call on Tuesday. “Will AI continue unfettered in leadership? Also, no.” Subramanian unpacked her thoughts in a recent note on the future of AI, which she sees as somewhere between fully reliable and an all-out bubble burst, where capital spending is still greater than revenue growth. “On AI, in our view, investors should get ready for an air pocket,” Subramanian wrote. “Monetization is to be determined, and power is the bottleneck and will take a while to build out. So for now, investors are buying the dream.” BofA took a more bearish stance on its stock market outlook for 2026 as a result of these air pocket concerns, forecasting just a 4% upside for the S&P 500 from where it currently sits. It breaks from the more bullish takes of analysts, including Deutsche Bank’s bet on a 17% jump at the end of next year and market veteran Ed Yardeni’s prediction of the S&P growing another 10% from this year to next. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, mirrored Subramanian’s stance on the AI boom, saying at a media roundtable on Tuesday that there’s enough skepticism from investors and markets that there shouldn’t be too much concern of a bubble. “We don’t think the bubble framing is that useful at this stage for investors,” Boivin said. “There is so much talk about the potential of the bubble … People are conscious of the risk. It’s when there’s no discussion of that that we should be more worried.” The good news about today’s AI boom, Subramanian said, is that there appears to already be a series of checks and balances in place to curb AI hype. That includes recommended stock allocations: While the concentration of the S&P 500 has tightened, with the top 10 companies in the index accounting for 40% of its market capitalization, Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok has pushed for greater diversification. “One should have some exposure to the S&P 500 and should certainly also have some exposure to AI,” Slok told Fortune in July. “But it’s very clear that [owing to] the market’s extreme focus and concentration on this story, this is the time to have a conversation around, ‘What are the things I should be doing with my money?’” In addition to smaller IPOs and less extreme speculation in unprofitable stocks, Subramanian said, markets have some healthy skepticism about Big Tech’s capex spending. Meta’s October earnings report sparked a selloff that dropped shares by 9%, following CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitting the company raised guidance for capital expenditures by $2 billion. The continued capex push is also what has made analysts jittery about an AI air pocket. According to Bank of America, investors are right to be concerned with hyperscalers’ rising capex spending, particularly on data centers, which surged 53% year over year to $134 billion in just the first quarter of this year, Dell’Oro Group found. Google became the latest tech giant to expand its data center footprint last month, pledging $40 billion to growing its AI compute infrastructure in Texas. However, “capex funded by operating cash flow is running out,” Subramanian noted, with hyperscalers increasingly funding operations through debt. She noted the supply of AI infrastructure has increased by more than 1,000% from 2024 to 2025. Indeed, BofA analyst Yuri Seliger wrote in a research note last month that the five hyperscalers—Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle—issued $121 billion in debt this year alone, a whopping four times the average debt the companies issued annually in the past five years. Seliger added that he expected an additional $100 million in debt raised in 2026. By IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s back-of-the-napkin math, these hyperscalers’ big bets on growing AI supply won’t be worth it, as they will be unable to turn a profit from the steep investment in data centers. They will be made vulnerable by AI’s rapidly advancing technology, which would render today’s infrastructure obsolete. “It’s my view that there’s no way you’re going to get a return on that, because $8 trillion of capex means you need roughly $800 billion of profit just to pay for the interest,” Krishna said on a Monday episode of the Decoder podcast. “You’ve got to use it all in five years because at that point, you’ve got to throw it away and refill it.”

I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I've always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on Wanderfugl 🐦, the AI-powered map I've been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I've sacrificed. Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I'd never seen her direct at me before. When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she's forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn't about me at all. It was about her entire environment. Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org "wasn't effective enough at using Copilot 365." I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this? After a pause I tried to share how much better I've been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn't fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She's drowning in resentment. I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem. But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn't true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard "AI." When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing "growth mindset" everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things. I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change. That world is gone. When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org's charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might've been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion. Then came the AI panic. If you could classify your project as "AI," you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn't, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as "not AI talent." And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft's AI tools whether they worked or not. Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors' tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually. But you weren't allowed to fix them—that was the AI org's turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet. Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren't "embracing AI." Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos. Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot. This belief system—that AI is useless and that you're not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups: 1. The companies. They've taught their best engineers that innovation isn't their job. 2. The engineers. They're stuck in resentment and self-doubt while their careers stall. 3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle. Say "AI" and people treat you like a threat or an idiot. And the loop feeds itself: Engineers don't try because they think they can't. Companies don't empower them because they assume they shouldn't. Bad products reinforce the belief that AI is doomed. The spiral locks in. My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she's both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn't worth doing anyway. She's wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she'd land there. Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.

Title: Coinbase Partnering With Major U.S. Banks on Stablecoin and Crypto Pilots

Coinbase (COIN) is partnering with some of the largest banks in the U.S. on pilot programs involving stablecoins, crypto custody and trading, CEO Brian Armstrong said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity,” Armstrong said during a discussion alongside BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. He did not name specific banks. “The ones who are fighting it are going to get left behind.” The announcement suggests a quiet but growing embrace of crypto infrastructure by mainstream financial institutions, even as the broader market remains under tight regulatory scrutiny. Stablecoins — digital tokens backed by cash or cash-like assets — have become a central focus for banks exploring tokenized finance. Coinbase believes the stablecoin market will balloon to a $1.2 trillion market by 2028 as it sees potential for thousands of growth paths for the sector. Many U.S. banks are already deep into innovating using stablecoins. Citi, which has previously announced plans to collaborate with Coinbase on stablecoin payment solutions, projects the industry to reach $4 trillion by 2030 in a bull case. The joint appearance also covered broader themes. Fink, who once dismissed bitcoin BTC$92,314.32, now sees it as a hedge in uncertain times. “You own bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security, uou own it because you’re frightened of your financial security,” he said. For Fink, bitcoin is less about speculation and more about long-term protection from currency debasement and ballooning debt. While bitcoin has seen a steep drawdown over the past few months, Fink said he continues to sees a "big, large use case." Armstrong echoed that view, saying that there's "no chance" that the asset will go to zero. Armstrong also pressed for clearer rules from Washington. He said he hopes the U.S. Senate will soon vote on a bill known as the CLARITY Act, which would establish legal definitions and responsibilities for crypto exchanges, token issuers and other players in the digital asset space.

Title: We Might Finally Get Some Big AI IPOs—Which Would Mean a Look at Their Financials

Here come the big AI IPOs. (Maybe.) Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot, is preparing for an initial public offering that could come next year, according to the Financial Times. The company is also said to be in talks to raise funding that would push its valuation over $300 billion. The report followed others saying OpenAI, the company behind rival ChatGPT, is also getting ready for an IPO that could drive its valuation to $1 trillion. Spokespeople for both Anthropic and OpenAI denied having set plans for an IPO in those reports. The first of these companies to reach public markets will set the bar for the rest—and open up the AI-investment landscape beyond the biggest publicly traded tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META), whose stock valuations have lately stoked concerns of bubble-ish excesses. It would also give the masses a good look at the economics of AI language-model developers. Elon Musk's xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot, in late November was said to be preparing to close a $15 billion fundraising round in December, pushing its pre-money valuation to $230 billion. The most well-known AI frontier startups—companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Databricks, Perplexity and xAI—are private. One going public could prompt others to follow, which would open up the AI investment landscape beyond the chipmakers and Big Tech companies that investors have poured dollars into. IPO documents, particularly those called S-1 filings, are rich sources of information, because companies are legally bound to give public-market investors a thorough look at the business before they raise funds from them. The big reveal is in the financials—what revenue growth looks like, profit margins, and how much cash companies are burning to develop new products, the latter of which has been a source of AI investor angst. They'll also show companies' cap tables, detailing their ownership structure. Filings from Anthropic or OpenAI would adress a lot of investor questions about the state of frontier AI development. Meanwhile, private markets are flush with AI startups. The sector has drawn roughly 65% of venture capital investments in 2025 through the third quarter, according a PitchBook's report published this week. Though that figure is skewed by the multibillion-dollar fundraising rounds of a few big startups, it also shows how ubiquitous such startups have become. "No other emerging technology has accounted for a larger share of total deal activity," PitchBook director of research Kyle Stanford and his team wrote in the report. The old high-water mark was in early 2013, when mobile accounted for roughly 20% of deal counts; AI accounts for 35% currently. That could make for an exciting pipeline of coming IPOs if one AI startup unlocks the floodgates to public markets. But it could also fuel Dotcom bubble comparisons.

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at a press conference during the DealBook Summit that he has reversed his earlier skepticism about Bitcoin and now considers his previous views to have been wrong. He described the shift as a major change in his thinking about Bitcoin and crypto. As he put it, “I have very strong views but that does not mean I am not open. My thought process is always evolving and this is a clear public example of a major shift in my opinions.” The shift marks a significant evolution for the world’s largest asset manager, which oversees investment products including exchange-traded funds focused on traditional and digital assets. Fink has compared Bitcoin to gold for its potential in providing uncorrelated returns in investment portfolios. BlackRock’s embrace of digital assets extends beyond rhetoric. The firm manages the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price through a regulated vehicle.

Title: This Meta Quest 3 charging dock won't stop beeping at me, but damn does it keep my VR setup neat and tidy

Time Published: 2025-12-03T18:03:08Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The PrismXR charging dock is certainly one of the neatest stands for the Quest 3 you'll find on the shelves. It keeps things low-profile, charges the headset and its controllers, and doesn't take up much room on a shelf or desk. But there are some definite annoyances that prevent this from being an easy recommendation. Charges the controllers and the headset Supplies rechargeable batteries for the controllers Neat, tidy look while on display Handy indicator LEDs to show how much each element is charged Compatible with headstraps from other brands Annoying, incessant beeping Doesn't seem to turn itself off when the headset is fully charged Separate version for the Quest 3S -Not the fastest method of charging Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Pretty soon after setting up my Quest 3, I realised how quickly the controllers lose battery. In fact, even if I didn't use them or the headset for a week or two, I'd frequently come back to find them completely drained. Having only used a charging stand that gave power to the headset itself, I knew my budget for batteries would thank me if I tried something that charged the controllers too. So, to the best Meta Quest accessories I turned, and of all the available charging stands, PrismXR's filled the most gaps in the market for me. It charges the headset and the controllers, but also feels perfect for anyone who wants a pretty low-profile way of displaying their VR loadout. It doesn't have fancy RGB or stand too high for a lot of shelfing units, and its aesthetic matches the Quest 3's as though it was made by Meta itself. For $69.99 / £69.99, it's roughly on par with the cost of most other charging docks, so let's see how it performs. Having just reviewed the PrismXR charging belt for Quest 3 and 3S, I had high hopes for this dock as a follow-up. Just like the charging belt, this is fairly self-explanatory. The Carina D1 is a dock that you can plug in via USB-C that'll magnetically charge your headset and controllers. Rather annoyingly, because this was designed with the Meta Quest 3 in mind before the 3S arrived on the scene, it has a fairly snug design that's bespoke for the original VR headset. For that reason, you'll need to opt for a separate version of this device for the Quest 3S, which leaves the door open for wrong purchases, but does help to create a neater match with whichever headset you own. From a quick search of both charging docks on Amazon and at PrismXR's own website, they seem to do the exact same thing, and for the most part, are the same price. That said, I'd think about looking into the price history of either at your own leisure because, like any and all Quest 3 accessories, their prices fluctuate madly. To keep the controllers charged, the D1 dock comes with rechargeable batteries, as well as different grip plates for your controllers so that they can attach magnetically. These feel exactly the same as the stock ones when using the controllers during VR play, and only take a minute to swap out. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Magnetics are the name of the game here, as magnetic charging pins are used to connect the bottom of the headset to the charging dock. For the overall aesthetic of the Carina D1, this helps to keep things nice and neat - there are no cables to be seen from the front. Perhaps my favorite thing about the dock's design is that it has a handy head strap pedestal at the back, which allows for more compatibility with third-party accessories. I was worried my KIWI Design Comfort Battery Strap wouldn't fit, but thanks to this handy add-on, I had no problems. In terms of technicals, the Carina D1 Charging Dock can Fast Charge up to 27W, which PrismXR says will take your Quest 3 from 0% to 50% in 45 minutes, and fully charge in 1hr50. The controllers have a quoted charging time of 2hr30. There are also some handy LED indicators on the front of the stand that tell you what level of battery the headset and two controllers are, and as I'll come on to, there are audible indicating bleeps too. I really like the look of the PrismXR charging dock. Its nest design means I was spoiled for choice for where to put it in my living space. It could fit in one of the shelves in my cube unit because it isn't too tall. It's not obnoxiously wide, so it can sit nicely with the other gaming hardware on my desk or a shelf. But at the same time, it still looks neat and tidy, and its white design lines up exactly with the color of the headset. The only real test of this dock, besides its looks, is how it charges the headset and controllers. If I'm honest, I'd like it to be a bit quicker, but that's mainly because I'm used to plugging it in at the wall with a super-fast charger and seeing it juice up pretty speedily. Arguably, for a charging stand, I don't think it necessarily needs to be super quick because it's where you put it when you know it'll be sitting to rest between sessions. Still, I found it took around an hour to charge the headset up to its 50% mark while the controllers were also connected - which I suppose matches up with the quoted 45-minute mark that I'll assume refers to just the headset being connected. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into At least the indicating LEDs are a handy way to keep tabs on charging progress. What isn't so handy is a very loud beeping tone that the D1 will pierce your eardrums with. When you first connect the headset and controllers, it'll beep. When it finishes charging them? It'll beep, and sometimes, keep beeping. I've seen reports of these bleeps being buggy and incessant for multiple users. Certainly, the first time I used the D1, that's the experience I had when my headset reached full charge. Other reports seem to suggest that the beeping is due to a faulty connection, which would line up with my experience of other times when the headset reached full charge, then didn't beep at all. Either way, these beeps are loud and a very annoying point of convenience-gone-wrong if they continually bug out for people. What's more unclear is whether or not the dock can turn itself off when the Quest 3 reaches full charge, because if not, it could cause you battery life issues further down the road. Unless you go and unplug the dock entirely or remove the headset so the magnetic pins aren't connected, it could keep charging your headset, or, in my case, beeping loudly. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into, but since this is a known issue for other users who have had larger connection problems, it's all a little unclear. Considering this brand's charging belt will turn itself off when it detects a fully charged headset, it's a bit of a shame that the charging dock isn't more upfront that it will do so as well. If you touch the LEDs, they'll go to sleep, but I'm not sure whether that actually turns the charging power off. Thankfully, I've found that my headset will still sit fine on the dock when it's just out of place enough that the pins aren't touching. This isn't ideal though, and goes against the snug aesthetic the charging stand is going for. Irritating beeping aside, I do think this charging stand is one of the better and more versatile ones available for the Quest 3. PrismXR has made something that's well designed and caters to a large cross-section of VR gamers who have lots of storage needs and headstraps already integrated into their setups. It's a shame that the charging isn't quicker, and there's definite friction with those indicating bleeps - which seem to be the most frequently reported issue in most customer reviews. Regardless, this is a charging stand I'll be keeping in my loadout, mainly thanks to its convenience of charging the headset along with its controllers, which can prove tricky otherwise. I integrated the PrismXR Carina D1 Charging Dock into my gaming setup for a number of weeks before this review was written. Since receiving the testing sample from PrismXR, it's been my main method of charging my VR headset and controllers. To put it to the test, I set a timer on how long it took to charge the headset in various scenarios: when it was at 0%, when it was at 50% going to 100%, and a full charge. I compared my experience to my time spent with other Quest 3 accessories. For more on how we test the latest gadgets, check out the GamesRadar+ hardware policy. Happy with flat screen games for now?

Title: Dave’s Hot Chicken is placing broad bets on AI to give the restaurant chain an edge in the chicken wars
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/03/daves-hot-chicken-is-placing-broad-bets-on-ai-to-give-the-restaurant-chain-an-edge-in-the-chicken-wars/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T17:44:27Z
Full Content:
Leon Davoyan, the chief technology officer for Dave’s Hot Chicken, has ramped up the application of artificial intelligence across the restaurant chain’s operations, including the drive-thru, mobile ordering, rover delivery, and robotic arms that whip up french fries. But he is cautious not to lose the human touch of hospitality. That AI-enabled drive-thru—a trendy application of AI that historically hasn’t had the smoothest deployment for larger chains including McDonald’s and Taco Bell—isn’t intended to replace workers. “Our strategy is to allow the human to do more with the robot assistant,” says Davoyan. All that said, successful deployments of AI, robotics, and other emerging technologies could give Dave’s Hot Chicken an edge in the fast-growing and highly competitive chicken restaurant category that includes incumbent brands like Chick-fil-A and Popeyes and fast-growing concepts like Raising Cane’s, Hangry Joe’s Hot Chicken & Wings, and Dave’s. Quick-service and fast-casual chicken restaurants expanded their domestic unit count by 4.7% in 2024 from the prior year, along with a sales leap of nearly 10%, according to market research Datassential. Adding more AI-enabled functionality to Dave’s Hot Chicken’s ordering systems has been a core priority for Davoyan over the past year and a half and will continue to be an area of focus in 2026. He has launched AI drive-thru ordering and hopes that the learnings from this application can be used to train large language models that could be tapped for similar functionality in the company’s mobile app. Dave’s Hot Chicken, which was acquired by private equity firm Roark Capital in a deal valued at around $1 billion earlier this year, is also working with several vendors to develop more precise predictions for when food will be ready. The times are then displayed on a digital order board within the store. When stores are busy, orders can take up to 45 minutes to be ready. Davoyan says he wants the predictive technology to get inside two minutes of accuracy. At the test stores where these systems have been deployed, Davoyan says the chain is adding seven to eight more transactions per week above locations that don’t have this feature. “The hypothesis is becoming true that if you serve up order-ready times more accurately, then the orders will come,” he adds. Dave’s Hot Chicken has also implemented some text-based updates for mobile orders, and in the future, Davoyan says he wants to add in-app order status updates similar to what DoorDash and Uber Eats offers. At the front counter of the restaurant, Dave’s Hot Chicken has deployed kiosks, which are positioned to be slightly tilted so the cashier can monitor ordering progress and step in if there are any issues. The company says 23% of in-restaurant orders are booked by the kiosks today, and they increase the check amount by an average of 5.9%. Davoyan says this revenue generation results in a return on investment that’s under a year. “We don’t remove the human element,” says Davoyan. “We have yet to reduce head count with all the things that we’re testing.” Davoyan has also rolled out Microsoft Copilot across the corporate office, though he’s not completely sold on the maturity of the technology. “I think there are other solutions that we should explore,” he says. Other internal applications of AI include customer service, where favorable restaurant reviews get an AI-written response that’s automatically published online, while the reviews with more critical feedback are reviewed and edited by a customer service agent before the AI drafted response is approved. AI is also being used for drone and rover deliveries and will be incorporated in the company’s two test robotic arms at the fry station. “We’re going to use AI to predict how many fries we’re going to need,” says Davoyan, who wants these robots to produce a constant flow of fresh fries that doesn’t hurt food quality. He says that the autonomous french fry functionality is seeing a return on investment, but not yet below the two-year threshold that Dave’s Hot Chicken looks for when spending on tech. “Robots are very expensive,” says Davoyan. “It creates a barrier of entry for restaurants.” Dave’s Hot Chicken also managed to completely avoid the Amazon Web Services cloud outage that ensnared tech firms, banks, and airlines in October. The company’s point of sale system relies on the vendor Qu, which has installed a physical device that runs cloud locally in every store. “We made all of our customers deploy the edge device,” says Amir Hudda, Qu’s CEO, whose other clients include Blaze Pizza and Jack in the Box. None of those restaurants were impacted by the AWS shutdown. Davoyan says Infrastructure is easy to take for granted because of the general reliability that tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft offer their customers. But big outages have become more commonplace, including at Cloudflare last month and Microsoft Azure in October. And because restaurants operate on extremely thin margins, they cannot afford lost sales when POS systems are down and orders need to be halted or processed by hand. “We knew that the day would come where there would be some level of meltdown and because we have high volume locations, we made that a priority,” says Davoyan. “You should always have a backup plan.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. OpenAI issues "Code Red" as Google mounts challenge. The Wall Street Journalreports on a company memo issued this week by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that declared a "code red" to focus efforts on bolstering ChatGPT, including increasing its speed and reliability, and put less effort on other products. This comes less than a month after Google's newest model, Gemini 3, won rave reviews for its capabilities in reasoning, coding, and some tasks performed by AI chatbots. In other news on OpenAI, the company on Monday announced it would take an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a deal that would enable OpenAI to embed more AI tools in accounting and IT services companies. Separately, the AI startup also struck a deal with Accenture, giving ChatGPT Enterprise access to tens of thousands of the consulting giant’s employees. Nvidia makes yet another AI investment. The AI chipmaker announced it bought a $2 billion stake in Synopsys, part of an expanded partnership between the pair as they plan to integrate Nvidia’s AI capabilities with Synopsys’ engineering solutions targeted to research and development teams across a number of sectors including aerospace and automotive. Nvidia has been on an AI investment splurge, recently pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, $15 billion alongside Microsoft in Anthropic, and $5 billion in Intel. DeepSeek debuts new AI models that rival OpenAI, Google. China-based AI startup DeepSeek debuted two new versions of an experimental AI model that it claims match some od the capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini-3 Pro. Bloomberg reports that the new AI models have fresh capabilities to help combine reasoning and execute certain actions autonomously. Venturebeat reports that the claim of parity with DeepSeek’s American rivals is based on testing across mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks. There’s been a steady drumbeat of new AI model rollouts over the past couple of weeks, including from Anthropic, Google, and Runway—the latter on Monday unveiled a new video model it says is good at understanding physics, human motion, camera movements, and cause and effect. HP cutting jobs as it contends with higher chips costs. The PC maker announced it would cut 4,000 to 6,000 employees through fiscal 2028 as it plans to apply more usage of AI tools to areas like product development, customer support, and sales and marketing, CEO Enrique Lores told Bloomberg. The company has recently benefited from increased demand for new AI PCs but is also dealing with higher memory chips prices, which is cutting into profits. Layoffs have also recently been announced at Apple, which cut some sales jobs, and at Verizon, with the telecommunications giant trimming 13,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce. The cuts across major tech giants comes as a recent KPMG survey showed that 52% of U.S. workers fear AI will replace their jobs, a fear that’s nearly doubled from last year. Campbell’s fires IT exec after accusations of racist remarks caught on audio. Campbell’s last week disclosed that Martin Bally, a VP of IT, was no longer with the food giant after the company reviewed an audio recording in which the executive allegedly said the company’s products were “highly processed food” for “poor people.” The audiotape surfaced as part of an ongoing lawsuit with a former employee who alleged Bally had made racist remarks about Indian workers. Bally had worked at Campbell’s for nearly four years and previously served in technology leadership roles at automotive manufacturer Stellantis and automotive products supplier American Axle & Manufacturing. Real estate industry embraces AI but few are fully pleased with their AI pilots. The number of corporate real estate property managers running AI pilots has soared from 5% in 2023 to 92% by July of this year and these property occupiers are pursuing an average of five pilot projects simultaneously across a broad swatch of use cases ranging from documentation to energy management to design and construction planning, according to a survey of over 1,000 senior CRE decision-makers conducted by commercial real estate and investment management company JLL. “That is really surprising, because the commercial real estate industry is usually considered to be a laggard in terms of adopting technology,” says Yao Morin, CTO at JLL, in an interview with Fortune. Still, Morin notes that the survey found that only 5% of CRE leaders report they have achieved “most program goals” with their AI pilots. She said some pain points that JLL has observed include the messiness of organizing real estate data, which relies on a lot of unstructured data from physical operations, and accurately measuring how much efficiency can actually be derived from AI tools.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAM.5gsm9dvqh Share article Print article As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into workplace systems and operations, it’s reshaping both how work tasks are completed and the very experience of work itself. For many employees, AI is stress-testing their tolerance for uncertainty and job insecurity. Some positions are being automated entirely. Others are becoming redundant. In many cases, full-time roles are being reduced to part-time or contract work. These changes have been very visible in this year’s news headlines. UPS, for example, announced 20,000 layoffs in April while expressing interest in deploying humanoid robots from Figure AI to take over warehouse tasks. Recently, this disruption has moved beyond front-line roles. Amazon has revealed plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs to reorganize around AI-enhanced efficiency. Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees — most of them software engineers and programmers — as AI systems now generate up to 30 per cent of new code on its projects. Employees do not stand on equal footing in the face of these changes, nor do they experience the same level of vulnerability. The capacity to respond to AI-related job threats varies sharply based on income, education, race and digital access. These disparities ultimately shape who can adapt and leverage new technological opportunities, and who becomes excluded from them and left behind. Employees face unequal vulnerability to AI-related job threats largely because automation disproportionately targets entry-level and front-line positions. These are typically lower-wage roles, often held by people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and marginalized communities. Such positions typically involve routine or repetitive tasks in sectors like customer service, retail, administration, warehousing and food service. Reports show these jobs are up to 14 times more likely to be displaced than higher-wage positions. Women are 1.5 times more likely than men to be pushed into new occupations as a result. People in these roles also face greater barriers in accessing employment and advancement opportunities, which perpetuates cycles of economic insecurity among groups that are already vulnerable. In contrast, AI is significantly boosting efficiency and productivity for knowledge workers in higher-wage positions. Surveys show 75 per cent of knowledge workers now use AI tools and report a 66 per cent average increase in productivity. These employees are far better positioned to integrate AI into their workflow. For example, national data shows that Canadian employees benefit most from AI when their jobs involve “complementary” tasks. These are tasks that AI can augment or enhance. This complementarity is strongly tied to education. It is highest among employees with graduate degrees and steadily declines as education levels drop. As a result, the benefits associated with AI flow disproportionately to higher-educated, high-income professional workers, enabling them to manage larger workloads and complete tasks faster. Some workers save up to one-third of their work hours. AI can also improve the quality of their work. Research shows consultants who use AI produce work that is more than 40 per cent higher in quality than those who don’t use AI. These advantages can accelerate career progression and income growth for people already in privileged socioeconomic positions. These patterns reinforce existing class inequities by expanding opportunities for those in high-income, professional roles while deepening precarity for those in low-income, entry-level and front-line roles. Upskilling and reskilling are often presented as solutions to AI-related job threats, but access to these opportunities is unevenly distributed across social groups. Upskilling refers to developing more advanced skills within a current role, while reskilling involves learning entirely new skills to transition into a different job. High-income, highly educated professionals receive far more institutional support to upskill or reskill, such as employer-funded training, paid time to learn new tools and access to advanced digital tools. In contrast, workers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and low-income jobs often lack the financial means, time and organizational support needed to develop new skills. These structural gaps are reflected in participation rates: a survey by Gallup and Amazon shows that 75 per cent of workers in computer-related occupations engage in upskilling, compared with less than one-third of workers in office administration, food service, production and transportation roles. As a result, workers in precarious and vulnerable positions are further disadvantaged by the barriers they face in accessing opportunities to respond to technological threats. Differences in digital access and literacy create another layer of inequality in how different groups experience AI. The digital divide is tied to disparities in digital and AI literacy across income, geography, age, education and occupation. People in high-income, white-collar roles, urban areas and well-resourced institutions typically have reliable internet, AI tools and access to digital skills training. They also develop AI literacy through formal education and job training, which gives them more opportunities to experiment with AI and integrate it into their work. However, those in manual jobs, rural areas, low-income households, marginalized communities and older age groups often lack stable connectivity, updated technology and access to formal training, making AI adoption more difficult for them. This leaves them more vulnerable to AI-related job threats. These gaps in access and skills reinforce existing socioeconomic inequalities by concentrating the benefits of AI among advantaged groups while heightening the risks for those with fewer resources. AI holds great potential to positively impact employees, organizations and the workplace. However, without equitable access to upskilling, reskilling, training, digital resources and AI literacy, the technology can deepen the disparities between different social groups. Closing these gaps and creating fair opportunities for adaptation is essential if AI is to benefit our society more broadly and equitably.

Title: Bitcoin’s biggest booster Michael Saylor fights to stave off an $8 billion collapse and being the first major crypto domino to fall

Billionaire Michael Saylor has been in tight spots before but nothing like this. The share price of Saylor’s firm, Strategy, which owns over 3% of the world’s Bitcoin, is down dramatically. Worse, the company faces twin headwinds in the form of a bearish crypto market and an impending rule change that will likely trigger a mass selloff of its stock. On Monday, the company announced a $1.2 billion reserve fund to meet impending interest and dividend obligations, but that did little to prop up its shares. All of this fueled fresh attacks from Saylor’s critics who say Strategy’s unusual business model, which revolves around selling stock to buy Bitcoin, is unsustainable or even a Ponzi scheme. Saylor has ridden out storms in the past. That includes an accounting scandal in 2000 that almost sank one of his previous companies and saw him lose $6 billion of his personal fortune in a day. Saylor’s defenders, meanwhile, dismiss critics as knee-jerk Bitcoin detractors who don’t understand the currency or the corporate finance techniques underlying Strategy’s operations. Saylor may escape from this bind, as he has in the past, but this time the stakes are higher. In recent years, Strategy’s purchases have helped fuel crypto’s record rise, and turned Saylor into Bitcoin’s leading evangelist. This means any move by Strategy to dump part of its holdings—something its CEO hinted last week could happen—would not only depress prices, but could spark a crisis of confidence and a broader selloff. Meanwhile, a further plunge in Strategy’s share price could not only threaten its future viability, but spur the collapse of dozens of other firms that have copied its business model. The coming months are likely to demonstrate once and for all whether Saylor is a pioneer in crypto finance, as his backers claim, or just another high-stakes gambler whose luck has run out. The crypto industry likes to hail October as “Uptober,” but this year failed to deliver the customary double-digit price boost. Instead, the month brought one of the biggest wipeouts in the industry’s history, and for Strategy, the month brought an extra helping of bad news when, on Oct. 10, financial giant MSCI proposed a new rule that would exclude it from a series of popular indexes. This delisting process, which looks set to go into effect in February, would oblige fund managers around the world to shed their holdings of Strategy, and other firms whose assets consist of 50% or more of crypto. In November, JPMorgan warned the rule change could see funds dump $2.3 billion worth of Strategy shares, and that the selloff could climb to over $8 billion if other index compilers followed MSCI’s example. The market’s growing awareness about MSCI’s plans has already triggered a selloff. Shares of MSTR (the MSTR ticker sign reflects Strategy’s previous name, Microstrategy) are down around 50% since Oct. 1. This has led a key metric known as mNAV, which reflects the value of a crypto company’s shares as a ratio of its Bitcoin holdings, to drop below one on several recent occasions. For a company whose mNAV a year ago reached around 2.45, the current figure underscores how the longtime premium that Strategy shares held over Bitcoin has evaporated. In response to such a spate of bad news, most CEOs would have issued a series of muted statements asking for patience. But Saylor is not an ordinary CEO and has instead responded by cranking up the number of memes he posts on social media. The memes extol Bitcoin and depict Saylor in AI-generated action hero poses—leading his many acolytes to retweet the memes or post their own version of them. These meme tactics have served Saylor well in the past, turning Strategy into a momentum play during bull markets. More recently, though, the gimmick has failed to stanch the stock’s downturn, and last month, Saylor posted a rare social media misfire. Seeking to rebut a rumor the company was selling its Bitcoin, Saylor shared an image of himself riding a life preserver in storm-tossed seas as a flaming ocean liner sank behind him. Critics, including Saylor fans, pointed out the meme implied Strategy’s captain was saving himself at a time of trouble rather than going down with his ship. HODL pic.twitter.com/sQysm4i88t Regardless of Saylor’s intent, the minor controversy raises questions about whether Strategy will resort to selling its Bitcoin holdings—a move the company has portrayed as unthinkable but, in recent weeks, appears set to accept. In late November, Strategy acquired 130 Bitcoin, bringing its total hoard to an even 650,000, which is worth around $58.5 billion at early December prices. For context, that amounts to around 3.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million (95% of which has been mined), and makes Strategy the biggest holder of the currency save for its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose 1.1 million coins are believed to be gone forever. According to Saylor, the company has paid an average price of $74,436 per Bitcoin, spending a total of around $48.4 billion, including fees and expenses. In order to pull this off, Strategy has needed a source of capital, and given that Bitcoin does not produce any yield, the company’s go-to technique has been to sell common shares to fund its purchases. A big upside to this approach is that, unlike debt, common shares do not create any financial obligations for the company. That’s not the case, though, with preferred shares—and Strategy has issued plenty of these as well, which obliges it to pay regular dividends to shareholders. These obligations include payments of roughly $200 million that are due by Dec. 31, the bulk of which are owed in the form of dividends (Strategy, like most companies, also carries some debt). In order to project a sense of financial stability, Strategy took the unusual step in early December of creating a so-called dollar reserve of $1.4 billion that Saylor says will be enough to cover the next 21 months of dividend obligations. Saylor announced the reserve fund at a Dec. 1 investor presentation where he added, with his usual bravado: “It’s our intention to keep stacking Bitcoin.” In the near future, though, that goal is likely to be aspirational and Strategy may instead find itself selling Bitcoin instead. “We can sell Bitcoin and we would sell Bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV,” Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast last Friday. It was a remarkable statement from a company that is premised on the value of Bitcoin always increasing. More remarkable was when Saylor, who frequently exhorts the popular hold-on-to-your-Bitcoin phrase “HODL,” repeated on Monday that Strategy could sell some Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang qualified the statement by saying the company planned to sell Bitcoin as a last resort and only if mNAV stays below one for a “very extended period.” Whatever the specifics, Strategy’s acknowledgment it could sell Bitcoin combined with the new dollar reserve fund has sparked a new wave of vitriol from Strategy critics. Those include Peter Schiff, an advocate for the gold industry and longtime crypto critic, who claims the company is coming undone, and that Saylor is the “biggest con man” on Wall Street. Today is the beginning of the end of $MSTR. Saylor was forced to sell stock not to buy Bitcoin, but to buy U.S. dollars merely to fund MSTR's interest and dividend obligations. The stock is broken. The business model is a fraud, and @Saylor is the biggest con man on Wall Street. If Schiff’s view—hardly a consensus one—is correct and Strategy has to liquidate, then the broader crypto market could be hit hard since the selloff would almost certainly trigger a downward price spiral for Bitcoin. Even if Strategy has to sell only a portion of its holdings, it could trigger a contagion in which hundreds of other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) do the same. But even as skeptics label Strategy and the DAT model as a house of cards built on financial chicanery, others view them as early leaders in an emerging category of crypto banks. Whatever one thinks of Saylor, there is no denying he is a natural showman. In his Dec. 1 presentation announcing the new U.S. dollar reserve, he displayed a futuristic-looking spaceship in garish green and orange with a Bitcoin powered reactor at its core. “Think of [the dollar reserve] as a $USD battery. We’re basically using a nuclear reactor to spin a generator to charge a battery,” explained Saylor. For Saylor’s detractors, all of this smacks of the worst type of hucksterism. Others see a visionary who is using compelling metaphors and imagery to help the public understand a complex new financial mechanism. The latter include Sebastian Bea, a former longtime BlackRock executive and Olympic rower, who is now president of a digital asset treasury called ReserveOne. According to Bea, Saylor is pursuing a sophisticated long-term strategy, and has surrounded himself with a team of corporate finance experts, including board member Peter Briger, who has had a distinguished career at Goldman Sachs and Fortress Investment Group. In this context, Saylor’s plans to purchase a growing supply of Bitcoin by tapping into capital markets for equity, commodities, and derivatives makes sense. As he and Strategy’s CFO explained this week, that plan includes bringing in revenue by lending Bitcoin and selling covered call options. For all of this to work, though, the value of Bitcoin will have to keep appreciating. This notion strikes crypto skeptics as absurd, but crypto advocates point out correctly that Bitcoin has grown faster than nearly any other asset over the past decade, and is poised for longer-term gains as large entities ranging from sovereign wealth funds to university endowments add it to their portfolios. In the latest bullish signal, Vanguard—which has refused to add crypto to its portfolio for years—elected to add Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs this week. If Bitcoin does keep appreciating, Strategy will be able to keep obtaining credit against the surplus value in the same way a company can do with real estate in a desirable market. There will of course be downturns but, according to Bea, Strategy “has planned for this” and has a healthy overall asset to debt ratio. Bea adds that the recent wave of digital asset treasury companies are akin to a new type of bank, and that their model is evolving rapidly. He points out that some, including ReserveOne, are based around cryptocurrencies like Ethereum that do provide yield unlike Bitcoin, which provides additional breathing room on the corporate finance front. Bea acknowledged that the impending move by MSCI to exclude DATs from indexes could be a significant headwind, and said that companies based around crypto holdings need time to evolve. Cosmo Jiang, a partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera, likewise believes that digital asset treasuries—including a Solana-focused company he is backing—will become a permanent feature of the financial landscape. “We’re seeing the genesis of a whole new category of business,” Jiang told Fortune, adding that DATs are poised to earn significant revenue from the fast-growing world of decentralized finance. In separate remarks to Bloomberg, Jiang made the case that the sector is currently at a low point, but that the current malaise around Strategy and similar firms is temporary. “We’re at the point where all the bad news is out there, and the bears are the loudest voices in the room.” Jiang noted, however, that many in the recent wave of crypto-hoarding companies are unlikely to survive, and that the business model required not just a stash of tokens, but deep experience in capital markets and corporate finance. “There will be two or three large winners” for each major cryptocurrency, he predicted. If this is the case, the coming months will likely determine whether one of those is Strategy.

Silver is experiencing a historic rally, outperforming gold with significant gains. Strong investor interest, limited supply from mines, and industrial applications are fueling its rise. China and India remain key buyers for both industrial use and jewelry. Economic uncertainty and a debasement trade also contribute to silver's appeal.

Title: U.S. Debt Growth Will Drive Crypto's Gains, BlackRock Says in Report on AI

Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, laid out its vision for 2026 and — reading past its bearish outlook for U.S. bonds and the world's largest economy — it’s a bullish blueprint for institutional crypto adoption. U.S. federal debt will swell past $38 trillion, setting the tone for a market outlook defined by fragility and the failure of traditional hedges, according to the report. For crypto that's good news, because this economic environment will lead to accelerated digital asset adoption among the Wall Street behemoths. More government borrowing "... creates vulnerabilities to shocks such as bond yield spikes tied to fiscal concerns or policy tensions between managing inflation and debt servicing costs," the report said. The warning on long-term U.S. Treasuries, the traditional backbone of finance, is a signal AI-driven leverage and government debt is likely to make the financial system more fragile, and may compel institutions to turn to alternative assets like bitcoin BTC$92,314.32 as a hedge against fiscal failure. The institutional flood of money into crypto, exemplified by the BlackRock’s $100 billion in bitcoin ETF allocations, its top revenue source, promises to take digital assets to all-time highs next year, with some analysts forecasting the largest cryptocurrency will climb to more than $200,000. This is all part of a "modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system," which provides the decentralized infrastructure to handle the private credit and asset management institutions seek. CEO Larry Fink described tokenization as the next generation of financial markets. The world’s largest asset manager’s report says it clearly: where government debt fails, the digital economy begins. ​​As for stablecoins, digital assets whose value is pegged to a real-world asset like the dollar or gold, they "are no longer niche, they're becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity," said Samara Cohen, Blackrock's global head of market development. The surge in computing power to drive AI is already benefiting bitcoin miners, who are able to parlay their energy deals into new uses as surging demand for high-performance computing drives up the value of their infrastructure. The AI buildout is constrained not by chips, but by power, accordion the report. In fact, AI data centers could demand up to 20% of current U.S. electricity by 2030. Several publicly traded mining firms reported increased revenue this year not just from mining, but from leasing out data center capacity to AI companies in need of power-hungry GPUs.

Title: Secretive $3T Fund Giant Makes Flashy Move Into Private Assets

Capital Group is teaming up with KKR to add private credit to its fund lineup and retirement portfolios. December 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Capital Group succeeded in keeping a low profile for almost a century, not even posting a sign outside its sprawling Los Angeles headquarters to call attention to its presence, as it offered millions of investors an array of mutual funds branded with a different humdrum name. But over much of the past decade, the firm looked on while rivals reinvented themselves and the rise of passive index investing and exchange-traded funds eroded its core business. Now, insiders say the world’s biggest active-only money manager can’t afford to watch from the sidelines any longer. In a break from its traditionally staid and secretive approach, the firm is embarking on a splashy marketing campaign, expanding its lineup of ETFs and ramping up a private-markets partnership with buyout giant KKR & Co. that it hopes will attract more retail money. The efforts, led by Chief Executive Officer Mike Gitlin, amount to one of Capital Group’s biggest strategic shifts since its 1931 founding. In an industry under immense pressure to change, the $3.3 trillion firm — best known for its lineup of American Funds and a big investor in the S&P 500’s top five companies including Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — is worried about getting left behind as private-markets rivals such as Apollo Global Management Inc. and Blackstone Inc. ramp up their own initiatives to attract more retail investors. Related:RIA Edge Private Markets: Crosscurrents in Private Credit, Real Estate “Every single client is shrinking their list of preferred partners,” Gitlin, 55, who declined an interview request, said in an emailed response to questions, adding that raising the firm’s voice reinforces its position with clients and helps attract new ones. “We’re constantly evolving.” Wealth advisers are narrowing rosters to just two or three managers that can offer a wide range of investing menus, including illiquid private-market strategies. New alliances are forming between established firms with access to everyday Americans and alternative asset managers that can originate privately negotiated deals. To that end, Gitlin is teaming up with KKR to launch funds for retail investors — and the pact is set to expand next year, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. It includes Capital Group’s first target-date fund for retirement plans that will contain public and private assets, as well as a similar model portfolio for retail investors. The firm will also manage some money for KKR’s Global Atlantic insurance arm. The partnership is designed to give investors diversified portfolios that blend public and private markets, according to KKR Co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. “Together, we can help close the gap between what’s available to institutions and what’s accessible to everyday savers,” they said in an emailed statement. Related:Smaller Loans, Big Impact: Direct Lending Excels in the Lower Middle Market This story is based on conversations with more than 20 people familiar with Capital Group whoasked not to be identified discussing internal matters. There’s a lot at stake for Gitlin, the former Citigroup Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. sales and trading executive, who took the helm in 2023, after investors had begun to turn away from the very mutual funds that long fueled Capital Group’s success. For each of the past 10 years, clients pulled more money out of the firm’s equity mutual funds and related products than they put in. Inflows into fixed-income and retirement products and new ETFs are beginning to mitigate those redemptions, which had persisted since 2021. “Private markets are the natural next frontier for asset managers like Capital Group,” said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, which invests in other money managers. “They can’t keep growing or even maintain their AUM by just continuing to do what they’ve done before. They have to evolve more than ever, but it's an increasingly crowded space, so it won’t be easy.” Related:InspereX Teams with SUBSCRIBE, Luma to Launch Alts Platform So far, two new funds with KKR have more than $500 million of assets under management. “It would take us 50 years to create KKR’s 50-year track record,” Gitlin said, adding that a partnership was always more likely than expanding through acquisitions. Capital Group’s clandestine and quirky culture — some even call it cult-like — has long fascinated the industry. Employees — in phone conversations, emails and meetings — are known by a combination of letters relating to their initials instead of their actual names. “Performance” is a shunned word, as it’s deemed to be better suited for the stage. Instead, executives talk about “results.” Given that the average tenure of portfolio managers is about two decades, these idiosyncrasies have become embedded in the culture. The firm has even branded its own management approach: the Capital System. Every portfolio is split across a team of managers and analysts, with each overseeing their own sleeve to avoid “star manager” risk. Junior employees expend a lot of time and energy networking internally, with potentially big rewards for those who can climb the ladder to become partner, which comes with life-changing compensation. Pay packages have elicited envy, with top portfolio managers earning about $10 million a year. But true to the firm’s typical pace, that doesn’t happen quickly, even for the best performers. Long-term bonuses aren’t paid based on the amount of assets managed, but on one-, three-, five- and eight-year track records, with more weight given to the latter, which discourages portfolio managers from making outsize short-term bets. With its push into privates, Capital Group is discarding some of the legacy peculiarities to appeal to retail investors. This year, it commissioned a hot-air balloon dubbed Winds of Frankfurt emblazoned with the firm's logo to fly over Germany to promote its business there. In September, it set up a pickleball court at an industry event in California that attracted thousands of financiers. Gitlin, described by some insiders as a driven salesman, is getting into the act, too: He hosts podcasts with the firm’s investors and sports stars, and posted photos of himself at the beach and elsewhere while he trained for a half-marathon. Like others in the industry, Gitlin is taking to social media to engage directly with a new prospective audience and shape the firm’s story. There are some personnel changes afoot, including the nature of Gitlin’s role as CEO. The firm has grown more complex and began pumping out new products in recent years, competing with the likes of BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in actively managed ETFs. As a result, Gitlin was tasked with solely running the business, rather than also managing money as his predecessors had done. There also has been turnover among senior executives, a rare occurrence historically, with at least five recent departures. They include Maddi Dessner, head of global asset class services, and Ryan Murphy, product leader of public-private strategies. Beth Rodenhuis, who oversaw digital products, left to become chief operating officer at Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. Meanwhile, more outsiders are joining the top ranks. The firm is hiring for a head of private markets — a newly created position — and brought on a prominent Washington lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump administration. Joseph Lai, a former McKinsey & Co. partner and leader in its asset-management practice, was tapped to become senior vice president of strategy, digital capabilities and analytics. The challenge for the firm has grown more apparent within the past decade. Its ETFs, which debuted in 2022, account for about $100 billion of assets — and before taking the helm, Gitlin built the fixed-income business into apowerhouse with more than $600 billion. But that still hasn’t been enough to completely offset the redemptions from its core lineup of American Funds. Read More: Capital Group Builds Bond Team to Chase Pimco in Fixed Income Capital Group’s mutual fund business has long been dominated by a relatively small list of very large US equity funds that have often beaten benchmarks and rivals. But its biggest mutual fund — Growth Fund of America, which dates to 1973 — shows the limits of its investing prowess when clients continue to march toward ETFs or low-cost index funds. With about $340 billion of client assets, it’s the largest actively managed mutual fund in the US, and it’s held in retirement and individual brokerage accounts for years at a time. Its performance has boosted assets roughly 40% over the past five years, fueled by large holdings in Nvidia, Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as a leading stake in Broadcom Inc. It also has one of the largest mutual fund stakes in OpenAI. That apparently hasn’t been enough for clients, who pulled $122 billion from the fund since the start of 2015 through September, according to Morningstar Inc. “Mutual funds remain in net outflows across the industry,” Gitlin said. “But overall we’re seeing strong demand for our investment services.” Capital Group, which previously dabbled in private markets, deliberated for roughly two years over how to grow in the asset class. Its portfolio managers regularly talk about investing in companies for the long term rather than trading in their shares, somewhat similar to take-private deals. Decades ago, it had a relationship with Sequoia Capital, the famed Silicon Valley tech investor, and some of its employees were able to invest in Sequoia’s funds, amassing considerable wealth in the process. Capital Group also briefly had an emerging-markets private equity strategy that struggled to grow and then shuttered. This time it’s trying to do private markets at scale and with its own resources. The hunt for a partner came with some fanfare, including pitches from KKR competitors including Apollo, Blackstone and Carlyle Group Inc. Top executives from some of those firms visited Capital Group’s headquarters, and Capital Group managers traveled to the East Coast for additional talks. Capital Group’s distribution network and relationships with legions of financial advisers was the crown jewel, as the winning bidder would inherit access to potentially millions of clients. The firm has relationships with more than 20 million households, and about 75% of all US financial advisers — roughly 216,000 in all — have Capital Group or American Funds in their portfolios. A meeting at Gitlin’s home with KKR’s Nuttall clinched the deal. KKR won because of its range of investment strategies and lack of overlap with what each firm was already offering: KKR can originate private assets, and Capital Group can bundle them to sell through its vast network of salespeople. The pair noted publicly that their cultures were among the most aligned. The two new funds, Capital Group KKR Core Plus+ and Capital Group KKR Multi-Sector+, have targets of 60% publicly traded debt and 40% private credit, including direct loans and debt backed by tangible assets. Two more planned funds will include private equity and real assets, according to the memo seen by Bloomberg. Negotiations on economics and break clauses for the partnership went down to the wire, with final terms being hashed out in the hours before it was announced. Agreeing on fees was among the thorniest challenges. Capital Group’s funds typically charge 0.2%to 1% of assets. By comparison,some KKR funds for wealthy individuals — in the K Series — levy management fees of more than 1% and performance fees of roughly 12%. The co-run funds charge as little as 0.84% and 0.89%, with no incentive fee. KKR will earn fees on the amount of assets it manages for the public-private credit funds. Another source of friction: differing expectations about how quickly products can be rolled out. KKR has been trying to accelerate the timing of some of the funds, while Capital Group has been taking a more deliberative approach, according to people familiar with the matter. A Capital Group spokesperson said the two firms are aligned on timing. Capital Group hasn’t pitched itself directly to investors historically, preferring to distribute funds through so-called wholesalers to financial advisers, who then market them to retail clients. American Funds are regularly among the top financial distribution relationships with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill. American Funds’ ties with Edward Jones, a firm with more than 20,000 financial advisers, is among the tightest in the history of mutual funds. American Funds paid Edward Jones $125 million in revenue-sharing agreements last year, more than triple the next largest recipient, and more than JPMorgan, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Ltd. combined, according to disclosures by Edward Jones. LPL Financial Holdings Inc., which services thousands of advisers, receives as much as 0.035% of assets invested in American Funds, plus a flat annual payment of up to $5 million. The Capital Group-KKR products “are designed to be more accessible and easier to implement,” Cheri Belski, LPL’s head of investment management solutions, said in an emailed statement. The race to capture the trillions of dollars of wealth in the hands of retail investors may be one of the biggest opportunities of the next decade, and Capital Group’s deep ties with such clients could position it to be one of the winners. “The partnership and push into private assets is potentially a big identity shift for Capital Group,” said St. Aubin, the Ocean Park CIO. “How it positions itself will be key.” To contact the authors of this story:Laura Benitez in Los Angeles at [email protected]Silla Brush in New York at [email protected] Laura Benitez Silla Brush You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

Title: BlackRock bets on tokenization, but IMF warns of uncontrollable ‘atomic’ domino effect
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-imf-tokenization-debate/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T14:30:28Z
Full Content:
Both BlackRock and the IMF acknowledge the potential of tokenization, but differ on its long-term effects. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, has described tokenization as the most critical market upgrade since the early internet. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes it as a volatile, untested architecture that can amplify financial shocks at machine speed. Both institutions are looking at the same innovation. Yet, the distance between their conclusions captures the most consequential debate in modern finance: whether tokenized markets will reinvent global infrastructure or reproduce its worst fragilities with new velocity. In a Dec. 1 op-ed for The Economist, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein argued that recording asset ownership on digital ledgers represents the next structural step in a decades-long modernization arc. They framed tokenization as a financial leap comparable to the arrival of SWIFT in 1977 or the shift from paper certificates to electronic trading. In contrast, the IMF warned in a recent explainer video that tokenized markets could be prone to flash crashes, liquidity fractures, and smart-contract domino cascades that turn local failures into systemic shocks. The split over tokenization arises from the fact that the two institutions operate under very different mandates. BlackRock, which has already rolled out tokenized funds and dominates the spot ETF market for digital assets, approaches tokenization as an infrastructure play. Its incentive is to expand global market access, compress settlement cycles to “T+0,” and broaden the investable universe. In that context, blockchain-based ledgers look like the next logical step in the evolution of financial plumbing. This means the technology offers a way to strip out costs and latency in the traditional financial world. However, the IMF operates from the opposite direction. As the stabilizer of the global monetary system, it focuses on the hard-to-predict feedback loops that arise when markets operate at extremely high speed. Traditional finance relies on settlement delays to net transactions and conserve liquidity. Tokenization introduces instantaneous settlement and composability across smart contracts. That structure is efficient in calm periods but can propagate shocks far faster than human intermediaries can respond. These perspectives do not contradict each other so much as they reflect different layers of responsibility. BlackRock is tasked with building the next generation of investment products. The IMF is tasked with identifying the fault lines before they spread. Tokenization sits at the intersection of that tension. Fink and Goldstein describe tokenization as a bridge “built from both sides of a river,” connecting traditional institutions with digital-first innovators. They argue that shared digital ledgers can eliminate slow, manual processes and replace disparate settlement pipelines with standardized rails that participants across jurisdictions can verify instantly. This view is not theoretical, though the data requires careful parsing. According to Token Terminal, the broader tokenized ecosystem is approaching $300 billion, a figure heavily anchored by dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. However, the actual test lies in the roughly $30 billion wedge of regulated real-world assets (RWAs), such as tokenized Treasuries, private credit, and bonds. Indeed, these regulated assets are no longer restricted to pilot programs. Tokenized government bond funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ondo’s products are now live. At the same time, precious metals have moved on-chain as well, with significant volumes in digital gold. The market has also seen fractionalized real estate shares and tokenized private credit instruments expand the investable universe beyond listed bonds and equities. In light of this, forecasts for this sector range from the optimistic to the astronomical. Reports from firms such as RedStone Finance project a “blue sky” scenario in which on-chain RWAs could reach $30 trillion by 2034. Meanwhile, more conservative estimates from McKinsey & Co. suggest the market could double as funds and treasuries migrate to blockchain rails. For BlackRock, even the conservative case represents a multi-trillion-dollar restructuring of financial infrastructure. Yet the IMF sees a parallel, less stable future. Its concern centers on the mechanics of atomic settlement. In today’s markets, trades are often “netted” at the end of the day, meaning banks only need to move the difference between what they bought and sold. Atomic settlement requires every trade to be fully funded instantly. In stressed conditions, this demand for pre-funded liquidity can spike, potentially causing liquidity to evaporate exactly when it is needed most. If automated contracts then trigger liquidations “like falling dominoes,” a localized problem could become a systemic cascade before regulators even receive the alert. Part of the enthusiasm around tokenization stems from the question of where the next cycle of market growth may originate. The last crypto cycle was characterized by memecoin-driven speculation, which generated high activity but drained liquidity without expanding long-term adoption. Advocates of tokenization argue that the next expansion will be driven not by retail speculation but by institutional yield strategies, including tokenized private credit, real-world debt instruments, and enterprise-grade vaults delivering predictable returns. Tokenization, in this framing, is not merely a technical upgrade but a new liquidity channel. Institutional allocators facing a constrained traditional yield environment may migrate to tokenized credit markets, where automated strategies and programmable settlement can yield higher, more efficient returns. However, this future remains unrealized because large banks, insurers, and pension funds face regulatory constraints. The Basel III Endgame rules, for example, assign punitive capital treatment to certain digital assets classified as “Group 2,” discouraging exposure to tokenized instruments unless regulators clarify the distinctions between volatile cryptocurrencies and regulated tokenized securities. Until that boundary is defined, the “wall of money” remains more potential than reality. Furthermore, the IMF argues that even if the funds arrive, they carry hidden leverage. A complex stack of automated contracts, collateralized debt positions, and tokenized credit instruments may create recursive dependencies. During periods of volatility, these chains can unwind faster than risk engines are designed to handle. The very features that make tokenization attractive, such as the instant settlement, composability, and global access, create feedback mechanisms that could amplify stress. The debate between BlackRock and the IMF is not about whether tokenization will integrate into global markets; it already has. It is about the trajectory of that integration. One path envisions a more efficient, accessible, globally synchronized market structure. The other anticipates a landscape where speed and connectivity create new forms of systemic vulnerability. However, in that future, the outcome will depend on whether global institutions can converge on coherent standards for interoperability, disclosure, and automated risk controls.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower on Wednesday after an ADP report showing job losses, following a stellar day across Wall Street on Tuesday. All of the major indices finished the day higher, with the technology-heavy NASDAQ leading the way, closing up 0.59% at 23,413. The S&P 500 ended the session at 6,829, up 0.25% and the Dow Jones Industrials were last seen at 47,474, up 0.39%. Traders and investors are still experiencing weekly volatility whiplash, so it’s difficult to determine whether any given day marks the start or end of a trend, up or down. The one consistent tailwind for stocks is the prospect of another Fed funds rate cut next week, now priced in at an 80% probability, up from as low as 20% a month ago. Strength in technology stocks and a cryptocurrency rally helped to drive shares higher on Tuesday. Yields were down across the curve as buyers returned, and the song remains the same: The anticipation of a rate cut next week, combined with prospects for economic growth in 2026, seems to be the two factors that are driving yields on any given day. With the smart money leaning on President Trump’s economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman, it’s a good bet that rates could be lowered even more in 2026. The 30-year-long bond closed at a 4.75% yield while the benchmark 10-year note finished the session at 4.09% In a complete reversal from yesterday, prices were lower across the energy sector, with both major benchmarks and Natural gas closing lower. The same combination of oversupply and changing prospects for ending the Russia-Ukraine war continues to tip the scales one way or another on any given day. Brent Crude closed Tuesday at $62.43, down 1.17%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen $58.62, down 1.18%. Natural gas completed the trifecta on Tuesday, closing down 1.83% at $4.83. Like the back-up in the energy sector, gold suffered the same fate on Tuesday as the risk-off mood that lifted stocks contributed to the selling in the precious metals. Top sector analysts attributed the move lower to trading accounts taking advantage of the recent moves higher and taking profits. Gold finished the day at $4,226, while Silver was last seen at $57.59. Cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday as recent dovish shifts in the Federal Reserve’s policy and the easing of liquidity pressures boosted risk assets like crypto, while advancements in decentralized applications and generally positive market sentiment also contributed to higher prices. The 30% drop in Bitcoin over the last couple of months was also a factor, as bargain-hunting investors were buyers. Bitcoin was trading at $91,494 at 5 PM EST, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,990. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: Binance Bitcoin Reserves Decline: Is It Time to Worry?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. As Bitcoin reserves on Binance continue to drop, many fear it’s a sign of lost faith. However, experts argue it’s actually a bullish trend in disguise. Bitcoin reserves held at Binance have fallen sharply in recent months: from roughly $71 billion at the peak to about $51 billion. However, on-chain researchers argue the move reflects structural accumulation and custody shifts rather than an exodus of confidence. CryptoQuant trackers and exchange-balance roundups attribute the decline to coins leaving trading wallets for longer-term storage, a pattern that has historically aligned with constructive market phases. Why Binance’s Bitcoin Reserves Are Declining “Historically, such conditions have supported medium- to long-term price appreciation. The current trend suggests that Binance’s reserve decline is a normal re-accumulation phase.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/g3TCG4o6GD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 3, 2025 Part of the drawdown is mechanical. As U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs gather assets, acquired BTC $92 375 24h volatility: 0.9% Market cap: $1.84 T Vol. 24h: $66.75 B is moved off exchanges and into external custodians for safekeeping. Therefore, it reduces the immediately tradable supply at venues like Binance. Industry coverage this week singled out inflows to funds from BlackRock and Fidelity as a key driver of lower exchange balances. It is consistent with CryptoQuant’s own playbook, which interprets exchange-reserve outflows driven by long-term custody as a bullish signal. Despite a 36% price decline from the ATH, the total Bitcoin ETF AUM (in BTC terms) has only declined by 3.5%, and 8.0% in USD cumulative terms. 60% of ETF inflows were at prices higher than today. Get more insights like this our market update newsletter: https://t.co/DFzmnPjy0U pic.twitter.com/oLwou1DK9R — Alec Dejanovic 🟠 🐊 (@alecdejanovicAU) December 2, 2025 While BTC reserves declined, stablecoin balances on Binance rose to record highs. The numbers crossed $50–51 billion by several tallies. Analysts frame this as sidelined capital that could re-enter as sentiment improves. CryptoQuant and market dashboards also note the BTC-to-stablecoin reserve ratio at Binance has sunk to multi-year lows, a setup that has preceded past rallies by signaling outsized buying power relative to available BTC on the venue. Broader tape still matters. Bitcoin dipped below $90,000 earlier this week amid risk-off flows and ETF redemptions, then stabilized. The move reminds traders that macro conditions can swamp constructive on-chain reads in the short run. Still, the combination of fewer coins on exchanges and more stablecoin “ammo” is the kind of on-chain backdrop bulls prefer.

More Info Saudi Arabia has launched production at the giant Jafurah natural gas field, the largest non-associated gas development in the Kingdom, which is key to the Saudi goal to significantly boost its gas processing capacity to meet rising demand. Saudi Aramco, the state oil giant, has completed the first phase of the Jafurah Gas Plant construction and launched production at the field with a capacity of 450 million cubic feet per day, the Saudi Finance Ministry said in the 2026 Budget announcement. Sustainable production at Jafurah is expected to reach 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day after the project is completed by 2030, the ministry said in highlights of the key Saudi achievements in the 2025 fiscal year. Earlier this year, BlackRock, through its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, led an $11 billion lease deal with Saudi Aramco involving key natural gas infrastructure tied to the Jafurah project. With a price tag of a total of $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cubic feet of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. When completed by 2030, the huge project is also expected to produce 420 million standard cubic feet per day of ethane, and 630,000 barrels per day of high-value liquids by 2030. The Jafurah project is a cornerstone of Saudi Aramco’s strategic gas expansion, which focuses on supplying growing natural gas demand in the Kingdom while investing in global LNG markets. “Jafurah kickstarts our plan to expand our overall sales gas production capacity, which will contribute to Saudi Arabia’s growth ambitions across multiple sectors including energy, artificial intelligence, and major industries such as petrochemicals,” Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser said upon the completion of the $11-billion Jafurah midstream deal.

Stock futures are slightly higher and bitcoin is rising as the market looks to add to yesterday's gains; AI company Anthropic is reportedly considering an initial public offering; Apple is expected to post its best year of iPhone sales thanks to strong demand in China; shares of Marvell Technology are soaring after the chip company reported strong earnings; and American Eagle stock is surging after the retailer said its performance got a boost from its affiliations with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open this morning as the market looks to gain ground for the second straight session after having a week-long winning streak snapped on Monday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq were up 0.2% recently. The major indexes posted solid gains on Tuesday as tech stocks rallied and bitcoin rebounded from a recent sell-off. Bitcoin was trading at $93,000 recently, up from an overnight low of around $91,000 and a low on Monday below $84,000. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,245 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 1.3% to $59.40 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.06%, down from 4.09% at yesterday's close. AI company Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and the maker of the Claude chatbot, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering the Financial Times reported. The company is reportedly working with a high-profile IPO law firm, and is in preliminary talks with banks to gauge interest. Anthropic is also considering raising more funding privately, with a new round that could include $15 billion from AI heavyweights Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and would value Anthropic at over $300 billion. AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI have commanded tremendous amounts of money from the private capital markets in recent years, but few purely AI companies are on the stock market today. Reports have also suggested that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is considering an IPO, but not in the immediate future, according to CNBC. Going public would require more financial disclosures than OpenAI and Anthropic are required to provide as private companies, and test how prepared investors are to put money into AI chatbot makers that have been burning through tens of billions in recent years with an unclear path to profitability. Apple (AAPL) is expected to post a record number of smartphone shipments globally in 2025 thanks to the success of its iPhone 17 model, according to data released by International Data Corporation. IDC estimates that Apple shipments will surpass 247 million units this year, a 6.1% increase from the year before. Huge demand in China is primarily responsible for the surge. IDC projects that Apple's China sales for the fourth quarter will be 17% higher than a year ago, while sales growth for the full year will be up 3%, both well above previous projections. IDC expects the global smartphone market to contract by 0.9% in 2026 owing to a shortage of memory components. Also, Apple reportedly has considered moving the iPhone 18 launch to early 2027 rather than its typical fall announcement and release window. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) are soaring in premarket trading after the semiconductor manufacturer topped profit estimates and announced a $3.25 billion acquisition. Marvell posted earnings in its fiscal 2026 third quarter of 76 cents per share, slightly topping the Wall Street consensus, while revenue of $2.07 billion matched analysts' estimates. Meanwhile, Marvell announced a deal to acquire Celestial AI, whose technology Marvell says can help make the servers inside the data centers that train and run AI models more efficient. Marvell expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, with Celestial AI meaningfully contributing to revenue by the back half of fiscal 2028. Marvell stock, which through yesterday's close was down 16% since the start of the year, rose more than 10% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are surging after the clothing retailer posted strong results and raised its outlook. The clothing retailer behind its namesake brand and others including Aerie said Tuesday it generated $1.36 billion in revenue in the third quarter, along with earnings per share of $0.53. Each was higher than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Comparable store sales rose 4% across the whole company. American Eagle lifted its forecasts for sales growth and operating income for the fourth quarter. In its earnings call, CEO Jay Schottenstein called out the company's recent marketing partnerships with celebrities such as actress Sydney Sweeney and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, saying they delivered "measurable benefits," per an AlphaSense transcript.

Title: Wall Street FOMO Over Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot: $HYPER Rides the Wave
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/vanguard-etf-pivot-causes-fomo-as-hyper-rides-the-wave/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: For years, Vanguard stood out as the big asset manager that wanted nothing to do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. That stance quietly shifted, and the pivot matters. When a $9+ trillion retirement giant opens the door to $BTC exposure, it adds another massive gatekeeper to the on-ramp for mainstream capital. It saw $BTC rally on Tuesday, jumping back up to the $92K mark from a recent dip below the $86K region. You now have BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard funneling retirement portfolios, 401(k)s, and brokerage accounts into spot Bitcoin. That flow doesn’t just push up $BTC’s market cap; it changes how traditional investors think about crypto risk. Bitcoin starts to look like ‘digital gold core holding,’ not a speculative side bet. The knock-on effect is obvious for traders: if Bitcoin becomes the safe, ETF-wrapped asset, the search for higher-octane upside moves further out on the risk curve. That’s where ecosystem plays, infrastructure tokens, and early-stage presales come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself exactly in that lane, pitching itself as a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 with Solana-grade performance. As capital crowds into spot BTC via TradFi rails, the question for more aggressive crypto traders isn’t ‘Should I own Bitcoin?’ anymore. It’s ‘Where can I get leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin network’s growth without using actual leverage?’ Wall Street’s ETF embrace solves one thing: easy Bitcoin exposure inside familiar accounts. It doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s technical pain points. The base layer still processes roughly 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees that spike into double digits when mempools clog. That limitation is a feature for store-of-value purists, but a brick wall for anyone wanting DeFi, gaming, or consumer apps atop Bitcoin. So you’re seeing a rush of infrastructure projects racing to bolt smart contracts and high throughput onto $BTC without compromising its settlement assurances. Competing visions include Ordinals-centric tooling, sidechains like Rootstock, and experimental rollup frameworks. In that crowded field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching itself as a unique contender, differentiating through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility. It has an explicit focus on traders and DeFi power users looking to amplify Bitcoin’s upside rather than just hold ETF shares. Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as ‘the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ aiming to deliver performance that can exceed Solana’s own execution speeds. Anchored by a canonical bridge that links Bitcoin’s security to high-speed execution, Bitcoin Hyper’s modular architecture combines the best of both worlds. The system relies on Bitcoin L1 for settlement while offloading processing to a real-time SVM Layer 2, where a single sequencer commits state roots on-chain. This bridge allows you to escape L1 congestion and access an ecosystem of instant, low-cost wrapped $BTC payments, NFTs, and DeFi. With support for Rust SDKs and Solana-style APIs, Bitcoin Hyper brings high-performance gaming and complex smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you want more info, check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. The market seems to be paying attention as the Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.8M so far. And smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have been making purchases as large as $500K. Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.08625, which, if you bought at today’s price, would see you with a potential ROI of over 545%. If you believe Vanguard and its peers will keep funneling conservative capital into spot Bitcoin, Layer 2s like $HYPER offer a different angle: upside tied not just to $BTC’s price, but to whether Bitcoin can finally host high-throughput applications at scale. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

Reserve your seat to see where your brand stands in the 2026 AI search race. Maximize ad profit. Stop wasting budget on weak pages. Learn the strategic landing page audit process to boost your conversion rates. Your campaigns are only as strong as the pages they lead to. You can have the most targeted ads, the sharpest copy, and a budget that makes your CFO nervous. But if your landing page doesn’t deliver on what the ad promised, you’re leaving money on the table and feeding poor signals back into your campaign algorithms. Landing pages are where intent meets experience. When they align, conversion rates increase. When they don’t, even high-quality traffic bounces, and your cost-per-acquisition (CPA) spirals upward. This post walks through the core elements of a high-performing landing page strategy. This strategy is one that not only converts visitors, but also strengthens your ad campaigns. Whether you’re running Google Ads or Meta campaigns, these landing page strategies apply. Most advertisers focus heavily on the ad itself: the creative, the targeting, the bid strategy. That makes sense. But the landing page is where the actual conversion happens. It’s the final step in the funnel, and it has a direct impact on campaign performance. Here’s why landing page audits should be a regular part of your paid media workflow: When more visitors convert, your cost per conversion drops. That gives you more room to scale or reinvest budget into other channels. Platforms like Google and Meta rely on conversion data to optimize your campaigns. If your landing page isn’t converting, the algorithm receives weak or misleading signals, which limits its ability to find high-intent users. Google rewards landing pages that are relevant, fast, and user-friendly. A higher quality score can lower your cost-per-click (CPC) and improve ad placement. In short, your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a feedback loop that shapes how well your campaigns perform over time. The first rule of landing page optimization is simple: Match the message. If your ad promises “free shipping on running shoes,” your landing page should immediately confirm that offer. If the ad targets “B2B marketing automation tools,” the page should speak directly to that audience and use case. Message match builds trust. When a visitor clicks an ad and lands on a page that looks, feels, and sounds different, they bounce. Fast. Here’s how to ensure relevance: The fewer mental leaps a visitor has to make, the more likely they are to convert. Your call-to-action (CTA) is the most important element on the page. It’s where intent turns into action. But too many landing pages bury the CTA, use vague language, or overwhelm visitors with multiple competing actions. That creates friction and kills conversions. Here’s how to get CTAs right: Your CTA should feel like the natural next step, not a sales pitch. Zoho CRM’s website is an excellent example of a landing page leveraging these points: Specific offer: The header “Get started with your 15-day free trial” is highly specific, clarifying the duration and type of offer, addressing the vagueness of a simple “Get Started.” Visual contrast: The primary CTA button, “GET STARTED,” is a high-contrast, bright red that immediately draws the eye away from the surrounding white and blue elements. Action-oriented copy: While the button copy is “GET STARTED,” the text immediately below it clarifies the action as a free trial sign-up, maintaining clarity. Furthermore, the page limits distractions, focusing the user on the single action of signing up for the trial. This approach effectively guides the user toward the intended conversion. Visuals aren’t just decoration. They communicate value, build trust, and guide the visitor’s attention. The right images can make your offer feel tangible and desirable. The wrong ones create confusion or undermine credibility. Here’s what works: Strong visuals support your copy. They don’t compete with it. Superside’s landing page demonstrates using a portfolio of images to support the message that they can handle diverse creative needs for clients across different industries: Show the outcome: Instead of a single generic image, the page prominently features a collage of actual client deliverables (app interfaces, product packaging, social media graphics) for brands like Amazon, Reddit, and Zapier. This directly illustrates the quality and range of the service’s outcome. Communicate value and trust: By showing recognized brand logos and diverse project types, the imagery instantly builds credibility and reinforces the claim that they can “Scale your in-house creative team with top global talent.” Avoid clutter (in context): While it’s a collage, the consistent presentation style and the grouping of images in a grid are purposefully designed to communicate a broad portfolio quickly, which directly reinforces the main headline: “Your creative team’s creative team.” This strategy uses visuals to provide immediate, tangible proof of the service’s capability. Your landing page needs to answer one critical question: Why should I choose you over the competition? This is where you articulate your unique value proposition (UVP). It’s not just about listing features. It’s about showing how your product or service solves a specific problem better than the alternatives. Here’s how to communicate your UVP effectively: Your UVP should be immediately visible, ideally above the fold. If a visitor has to scroll to understand what you’re offering, you’ve already lost some of them. Social proof reduces risk. It shows visitors that other people (ideally, people like them) have chosen your product or service and been satisfied. But not all social proof is created equal. The key is to use a mix of formats and place them strategically throughout the page. Here are the most effective types of social proof to look for when you are doing a landing page audit: Short, specific quotes from real customers carry more weight than generic praise. Include the customer’s name, title, and company (if B2B) to increase credibility. “We increased conversions by 30%” is more compelling than “Great service!” Quantifiable outcomes resonate, especially with data-driven buyers. If well-known brands use your product, feature their logos. Recognition builds instant trust. Aggregate ratings (e.g., “4.8/5 stars from 1,200+ customers”) provide quick validation. Link to third-party review sites like G2, Trustpilot, or Capterra for added credibility. Security seals, industry certifications, and compliance badges (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR) that are visible on landing pages reassure visitors that their data is safe. Place social proof near your CTA. That’s where hesitation peaks, and reassurance matters most. The Reddit Ads landing page demonstrates the effective use of logos of recognizable clients or partners to build instant trust and social proof: Client credibility: At the bottom of the page, a prominent line on the landing page reads, “Trusted businesses across all industries and sizes use Reddit Ads to meet their goals.” This statement is immediately backed up by a scrolling horizontal display of recognizable brand logos, including Mars, GameStop, Capital One, and Maybelline. Instant trust: For a potential advertiser, seeing global, established brands using the platform reduces the perceived risk of signing up. If major companies trust Reddit Ads with their budget, a new user can be reassured the platform is legitimate and effective. Strategic placement: The logo section is placed below the main registration form and the tool to explore audience, providing reinforcement just before a user might scroll away or hesitate. It offers a final, compelling piece of proof that supports the core message of reaching a “niche audience.” This visual list of successful clients serves as powerful validation for the service. A beautiful landing page means anything if it doesn’t load quickly or breaks on mobile devices. Technical performance directly impacts conversion rates and campaign quality scores. Google prioritizes fast, mobile-friendly pages, and visitors abandon slow-loading sites within seconds, noting that 53% of visits are likely to be abandoned if pages take longer than three seconds to load. Here’s what to audit: Technical problems aren’t just annoying. They cost you conversions and damage your campaign performance. Where you place your CTA matters just as much as what it says. Most landing pages include a primary CTA above the fold, and that’s a really good start. But high-converting pages use multiple CTAs placed at natural decision points throughout the page. Here’s a strategic approach: Each CTA should feel contextual, not pushy. It should align with where the visitor is in their journey down the page. Your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a data generator. Every click, scroll, and form submission sends signals back to your ad platform. These signals teach the algorithm which audiences convert, which creatives work, and how to allocate budget more efficiently. When your landing page converts well, those signals are strong and accurate. The algorithm learns faster and optimizes better. When your landing page underperforms, the data becomes noisy. The algorithm struggles to find patterns, and your campaigns stagnate. This is why landing page audits are essential. A small improvement in conversion rate doesn’t just boost revenue. It improves the quality of data feeding back into your campaigns, creating a compounding effect over time. Start by identifying your lowest-performing landing pages. Run A/B tests on headlines, CTAs, and imagery. Measure the impact not just on conversions, but on downstream metrics like CPA, return on ad spend (ROAS), and customer lifetime value (LTV). The better your landing pages perform, the smarter your campaigns become.

Title: Are we repeating the telecoms crash with AI datacenters?
URL: https://martinalderson.com/posts/are-we-really-repeating-the-telecoms-crash-with-ai-datacenters/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T11:14:56Z
Full Content:
I keep hearing the AI datacentre boom compared to the 2000s telecoms crash. The parallels seem obvious - billions in infrastructure spending, concerns about overbuilding, warnings of an imminent bubble. But when I actually ran the numbers, the fundamentals look completely different. I'm not here to predict whether there will or won't be a crash or correction. I just want to look at whether the comparison to telecoms actually holds up when you examine the history in a bit more detail. Let me start with what the 2000s telecoms crash actually looked like, because the details matter. Firstly, there was massive capex - between 1995 and 2000 somewhere like $2 trillion was spent laying 80-90 million miles of fiber. Inflation adjusted, this is over $4trillion, or close to $1trillion/year in 2025 dollars. By 2002 only 2.7% of this fibre was used. How did this happen? A catastrophic supply and demand miscalculation past the pure securities fraud involved in many of the companies. Telecom CEOs claimed internet traffic was doubling every 3-4 months. But in reality, traffic was doubling roughly every 12 months. That's a 4x overestimate of demand growth, which compounds each year. This false assumption drove massive debt-financed overbuilding. If you overestimate 4x a year for 3 years, by the end of your scenario you are 256x out. Even worse for these companies, enormous strides were made on the optical transceivers, allowing the same fibre to carry 100,000x more traffic over the following decade. Just one example is WDM multiplexing, allowing multiple carriers to be multiplexed on the same physical fibre line. In 1995 state of the art was 4-8 carriers. By 2000, it was 128. This alone allowed a 64x increase in capacity with the same infrastructure. Combined with improvements in modulation techniques, error correction, and the bits per second each carrier could handle, the same physical fibre became exponentially more capable. The key dynamic: supply improvements were exponential while demand was merely linear. While some physical infrastructure needed to be built, there was enormous overbuilding that could mostly be serviced by technology improvements on the same infrastructure. Unlike fibre optics in the 1990s, GPU performance per watt improvements are actually slowing down: 2015-2020 Period: 2020-2025 Period: More tellingly, GPU TDPs (power consumption) are rising dramatically: This is the opposite of what happened in telecoms. We're not seeing exponential efficiency gains that make existing infrastructure obsolete. Instead, we're seeing semiconductor physics hitting fundamental limits. The B200 from NVidia also requires liquid cooling - which means most datacentres designed for air cooling need to be completely retrofitted. The telecoms crash happened partly because demand was overestimated by 4x. What does AI demand growth look like? Traditional LLM Usage: ChatGPT averages 20+ prompts per user per day. Extended conversations can reach 3,000-4,000 tokens cumulative, though many users treat it like Google - short "searches" with no follow-up, consuming surprisingly few tokens. Agent Usage (Anthropic research): We're looking at a fundamentally different demand curve - if anything, people are underestimating how much agents will consume. The shift from chat to agents represents a 10x-100x increase in token consumption per user. We're not even there yet, and infrastructure is already maxed out, with AI infrastructure running at very high utilization rates. Major providers still experience peak-time capacity issues. The problem isn't unused infrastructure sitting idle; it's infrastructure struggling to meet current demand. One major hyperscaler told me they still have capacity issues at peak times causing free tier users to have high error rates. Another important piece of context that gets missed: Pre-AI Growth (2018-2021): AI Boom (2023-2025): While it's no doubt a huge amount of capex going into this rollout; it's not quite as dramatic as some news stories make out. I have no doubt that now any datacentre related capex is being rebranded as "AI", even if it's just 'boring' old compute, storage and network not being directly used for AI. Here's where I think the comparison to telecoms becomes both interesting and concerning. The Lead Time Problem: The Prisoner's Dilemma: The Forecasting Challenge: Imagine you're planning datacenter capacity right now for 2027. You need to make billion-dollar decisions today based on what you think AI usage will look like in three years. Here's scenario one: agent adoption is gradual. Some developers use Claude Code daily. A few enterprises deploy internal agents. Customer service stays mostly human with AI assist. You need maybe 3-4x your current infrastructure. Here's scenario two: agents go mainstream. Every developer has an always-on coding agent consuming millions of tokens per session. Enterprises deploy agents across operations, finance, legal, sales. Customer service becomes 80% agentic with humans handling escalations. You need 30-50x your current infrastructure. Both scenarios are completely plausible. Nobody can tell you which one is right. But you have to commit billions in capex NOW - datacenters take 2-3 years to build, GPU orders have 6-12 month lead times. But here's the really insidious part: even if you're directionally right, small errors compound massively. Let's say you're confident agents are going mainstream and you need roughly 50x growth over 3 years. If actual demand is 40x, you've overbuilt by 25% - billions in excess capacity. If actual demand is 60x, you've underbuilt by 20% - your service degrades and you lose market share. You're trying to hit a moving target in the dark, and the margin of error is measured in tens of billions of dollars and thousands of megawatts of power infrastructure. If you build for scenario one and scenario two happens, your service degrades to unusable, users revolt, and you lose the AI wars to competitors who bet bigger. If you build for scenario two and scenario one happens, you've got billions in underutilized datacenters burning cash. Which mistake would you rather make? This is where the telecoms comparison makes sense: given those choices, rational players overbuild. The difference is what happens to that overcapacity. Let me put this in a table: The telecoms crash happened because exponential supply improvements met linearly growing (and overestimated) demand, with infrastructure that would last decades sitting unused. AI datacenters are facing slowing supply improvements meeting potentially exponentially growing demand. And crucially, because GPU efficiency improvements are slowing down, today's hardware retains value for longer - not shorter - than previous generations. Could there still be a short-term crash? Absolutely. Scenarios that could trigger a correction: 1. Agent adoption hits a wall Enterprises might discover that production agent deployments are harder than demos suggest. Hallucinations in high-stakes workflows, regulatory concerns around autonomous AI systems, or implementation complexity could slow adoption dramatically. If the agent future takes 5-7 years instead of 2-3, there's a painful gap where billions in infrastructure sits waiting for demand to catch up. However, given the explosion in usage for software engineering and other tasks, I suspect this is highly unlikely. You can already use Claude Code for non engineering tasks in professional services and get very impressive results without any industry specific modifications, so I have no doubt there is going to be very high adoption of agents in all kinds of areas. 2. Financial engineering unravels These datacenter buildouts are heavily debt-financed. If credit markets seize up, interest rates spike further, or lenders lose confidence in AI growth projections, the financing model could collapse. This wouldn't be about technical fundamentals - it would be good old-fashioned financial panic, similar to what happened in telecoms when the debt markets froze, but with one key difference - a lot of the key players (Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle) are extremely cash flow positive, which definitely wasn't the case in the 2000s fibre boom. The pure datacentre players though are at risk - who don't have a money printing main business to backstop the finance - no doubt about that. 3. Efficiency breakthroughs change the math Model efficiency could improve faster than expected. Or we could see a hardware breakthrough: custom ASICs that are 10x more efficient than GB200s for inference workloads. Either scenario could make current buildouts look excessive. I actually think this is the biggest risk - and this is exactly what happened in the fibre boom. So far, I'm not seeing signs of this though. While specialist ASICs are becoming available, they hit their impressive speed by having huge wafers, which isn't a huge efficiency game (yet). The Key Difference From Telecoms: Even if there's a correction, the underlying dynamics are different. Telecoms built for demand that was 4x overestimated, then watched fiber optic technology improvements make their infrastructure obsolete before it could be utilized. The result: 95% of fiber remained permanently dark. AI datacenters might face a different scenario. If we build for 50x growth and only get 30x over 3 years, that's not "dark infrastructure" - that's just infrastructure that gets utilized on a slower timeline than expected. Unlike fiber optic cable sitting in the ground unused, GPU clusters still serve production workloads, just at lower capacity than planned. And unlike telecoms where exponential technology improvements made old infrastructure worthless, GPU efficiency improvements are slowing. A GB200 deployed today doesn't become obsolete when next year's chip arrives - because that chip is only incrementally better, not 100x better. With process node improvements slowing down, current generation hardware actually retains value for longer. A correction might mean 2-3 years of financial pain, consolidation, and write-downs as demand catches up to capacity. But that's fundamentally different from building infrastructure for demand that never materializes while technology makes it obsolete. I think the real question isn't whether we need massive AI infrastructure - the agent transition alone suggests we do. The question is timing. If enterprises take 5 years to adopt agents at scale instead of 2 years, and hyperscalers have built for the 2-year scenario, you could see a 2-3 year period of overcapacity and financial pain. That might be enough to trigger a correction, layoffs, and consolidation. But unlike telecoms, that overcapacity would likely get absorbed. The telecom fibre mostly stayed dark because technology outpaced it and demand never materialized. AI infrastructure might just be early, not wrong. Are we repeating the telecoms crash with AI datacenters? The fundamentals suggest not, but that doesn't mean there won't be bumps. The key insight people miss when making the telecoms comparison: telecoms had exponential supply improvements meeting linear demand, with 4x overestimated growth assumptions. AI has slowing supply improvements potentially meeting exponential demand growth from the agent transition. The risks are different: But the "too much" in AI's case is more like "3 years of runway instead of 1 year" rather than "95% will never be used." I could be wrong. Maybe agent adoption stalls, maybe model efficiency makes current infrastructure obsolete, maybe there's a breakthrough in GPU architecture that changes everything. But when I look at the numbers, I don't see the same setup as the telecoms crash. The fundamentals are different. That doesn't mean there won't be pain, consolidation, or failures. But comparing this to 2000s telecoms seems like the wrong mental model for what's actually happening. Once a month, max, I send an email with links to recent posts.

Title: Vanguard Raises White Flag Over Crypto ETFs
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/vanguard-raises-white-flag-over-crypto-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T11:10:00Z

The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com For having a name that means leading actions, movements and the development of new ideas, Vanguard has been curiously behind the industry in giving its clients access to crypto ETFs. That was the case until yesterday, when the low-cost, investor-focused financial giant made a big change, allowing some of the more mainstream (meaning not memecoin) digital-asset exchange-traded funds onto its brokerage system. That followed a decision by Morgan Stanley in October to expand crypto access to all clients, rather than limiting it to those with high risk tolerance and at least $1.5 million, as it previously had. And Vanguard’s change coincides with a move by Bank of America to recommend allocations of 1% to 4% of wealth management clients’ assets to Bitcoin ETFs. “Vanguard is the latest TradFi firm to do an about-face on crypto,” said Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, crediting CEO Salim Ramji, who has been at the helm since mid-2024, with the development. “It’s impossible to view this as anything other than highly bullish for Bitcoin and other major digital assets.” Vanguard acknowledged the already high and growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets, in a note to investors. The company didn’t publicize the change in the ways it would for a fund launch, new model portfolios or retirement data report. But it stated clearly on its site that its more than 50 million investor clients should approach crypto with caution. “These products have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity; the administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve,” the company stated. The funds are available in brokerage accounts, meaning that defined-contribution plan participants don’t have access outside of brokerage windows, a spokesperson told ETF Upside. There’s plenty for people to be excited (or worried) about: Righting the Ship? Edelman cast Vanguard’s until-now ban on crypto as a mistake. But in fixing the alleged mistake, the company is doing so at an opportune time, he said. “By making Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and other crypto ETFs available to its 50 million customers, Vanguard is letting them buy while crypto prices are 30% below their all-time highs,” he said. “Vanguard customers who take advantage of the sudden availability will find themselves sitting on nice profits in the future.”Still, it’s not necessarily right for everyone. “Crypto access is all well and good. But access is not an investment plan,” Jeff DeMaso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser, said in a note to investors. “For most investors, owning little, or none, is perfectly acceptable.” Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. AI and other tech platforms can help ETF issuers identify the best sales prospects among firms in their target markets. Asset managers acknowledge the reality of paying to access Schwab customers, as they have started to do with Fidelity. As active ETFs have exploded, so too has thematic investing, a dangerous trend for most investors, the author of a Morningstar report said. Some products don’t have the capital to get off the ground. Larger ETF issuers can fix that. The bond ladder ETFs come with a target date and can help advisors build income for clients’ major life events. The ETF issuer is among the first in line for dual share classes, and it plans to use mutual-fund shares to access 401(k) plans. Buffered ETFs are surging in popularity, particularly among retirees, and that bodes well for their future. More than half of RIAs increased the number of strategies in which they invested. ETF investors can feel the magic between A and I. It’s why they say they’re loading up on funds. Investors pulled more than half a billion dollars out of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in just one day last week. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Model Portfolios Decide Which ETFs Succeed. That Might Not Be a Good Thing

The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Advisors need to be unbiased, but what about the model portfolios they choose? Not surprisingly, when issuers create a model portfolio, they’re incentivized to include their own ETFs. But more and more funds with meager assets are suddenly spiking to reach hundreds of millions of dollars in AUM in just a few days, all because they were added to a major issuer’s model. The consequences could be significant for advisors who are increasingly relying on model portfolios, and who want to provide unbiased fiduciary advice to their clients, but don’t know where to start. “We see this trend, and it’s a little disturbing,” said Joe Mallen, CEO of Modelist, which builds customized portfolios for fiduciaries. “I don’t blame anyone for doing that. We just think that the relationship of who’s designing the model for the advisor should be one that suits the advisor, not the asset manager.” Earlier this month, the iShares Systematic Bond ETF (SYSB) grew to more than $600 million from just $67 million in a matter of days after it was added to one of BlackRock’s portfolios. The reason for BlackRock’s decision came down to expense ratios, Mallen said. However, BlackRock stated in a client communication shared with VettaFi that the firm is reducing “overweight to growth by adding to value, and pivoting from quality to momentum.” SYSB charges 25 basis points, while a comparable iShares bond product, IUSB, has a fee of just 6 basis points. That spread could generate more than $1 million in annual revenue based on the funds’ assets, according to Mallen. A recent VettaFi report pointed out spikes and falls in other funds due to model adjustments: A New Model. As more advisors rely on model portfolios to free up time with their clients, they’re spending less time doing due diligence, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. What might help in the future are tools that not only compare ETFs, but model portfolios, as well. “Should [advisors] be more aware? I think the answer is yes,” he added. “They need to know who’s the provider, what kinds of funds they tend to select, and then also choose the right model provider. You may want a model provider who’s agnostic to which funds are included.” Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. AI and other tech platforms can help ETF issuers identify the best sales prospects among firms in their target markets. Asset managers acknowledge the reality of paying to access Schwab customers, as they have started to do with Fidelity. As active ETFs have exploded, so too has thematic investing, a dangerous trend for most investors, the author of a Morningstar report said. Some products don’t have the capital to get off the ground. Larger ETF issuers can fix that. The bond ladder ETFs come with a target date and can help advisors build income for clients’ major life events. The ETF issuer is among the first in line for dual share classes, and it plans to use mutual-fund shares to access 401(k) plans. Buffered ETFs are surging in popularity, particularly among retirees, and that bodes well for their future. More than half of RIAs increased the number of strategies in which they invested. ETF investors can feel the magic between A and I. It’s why they say they’re loading up on funds. Investors pulled more than half a billion dollars out of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in just one day last week. © 2025 The Daily Upside

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson raised concerns about the lack of information about would-be presidential assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks and defended his subpoena of the FBI for records on him during an interview on “Pod Force One.” “All of a sudden I realize, here we are a year later, I haven’t heard a peep out of this. We still don’t know about, what did his social media accounts say?” Johnson (R-Wis.) lamented on the podcast. “Why haven’t we unlocked this information? Why doesn’t America know more about it?” he added. “There’s some odd things about it, him appearing in commercials for, was it BlackRock, just like the other potential assassin down in Palm Beach. I mean, it’s just bizarre stuff. I mean, explain this to us.” Crooks was ultimately killed by countersnipers after getting off a shot that grazed the top of President Trump’s right ear during his fateful July 13, 2024, rally in Butler, Pa. The 20-year-old killed firefighter Corey Comperatore and injured two others. Johnson, who helms the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, subpoenaed the FBI back in July this year for records on Crooks amid those concerns. “My subpoenas to this administration are friendly subpoenas,” he explained, before later adding: “There’s so many enormous messes that Trump and his department heads are trying to clean up. Some of these are maybe a high priority to me or you, but they’ve got kind of bigger fish to fry.” The Wisconsin senator is hoping that the telecommunications companies will help with his investigation into unraveling some of the mysteries around Crooks. “I think this was a news outlet, it might have been New York Post [that] did a geo-positioning search on Crooks’ phone and kind of like that Family Circus deals, all over the place, the FBI headquarters,” Johnson recounted. “My staff kind of cautions me about talking about that, because we’re not quite sure of the validity of thatas well. But I mean, again, those are the kinds of questions that deserve answers,” he added. “It’s those kind of questions that go unanswered that just feed into conspiracy theories.” In February, The Post reported on how a private investigator who looked into Crooks concluded that one of the electronic devices geolocated with Crooks at several different places at the time of the shooting was still pinging in Bethel Park High School. That investigator was suspicious that Crooks didn’t act alone.

Title: Michael Dell, who’s donating $6.25 billion to ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids, says a childhood savings account changed his life

Good morning. Earlier this week, I spoke to Michael Dell about his plan to put $250 in the so-called Trump Accounts (now called Invest America accounts) of 25 million American kids when the savings program launches next year. The $6.25 billion donation is more than double the total amount that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has dispensed in its 26-year history. As he told me in a wide-ranging interview: “When children have accounts like this, their outlook on life just changes.” In some ways, it changed his. “When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I got a passbook savings account. I had maybe $6 or $7 in it. I’d go to the Savings & Loan, put in a quarter, and they’d stamp my book. I learned about compound interest and savings and, I’m like, ‘This is really cool,’” he said. “That ignited an interest in me. Hopefully, these accounts will cause children to want to learn more about compound interest and the companies in the S&P 500 and investing and saving.” Dell went on to famously create the company now known as Dell Technologies in his freshman dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, and made enough money to start giving it away about a decade later, with the foundation launching in 1999. Of course, it’s easier to give away billions when you’re worth close to $150 billion, but Americans tend to be a generous lot. Overall, people gave $592.5 billion to U.S. charities last year, a new high that was no doubt boosted by stock market gains and a buoyant economy. It helps to have mechanisms that encourage giving, such as company matches and GivingTuesday, which the Dells chose for making their announcement. Brunswick Group CEO Henry Timms deserves credit for cofounding the GivingTuesday campaign in 2012 as a day for philanthropy following the big-spending traditions of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s since become a global ritual that raises billions in more than 60 countries. Dell, for one, approaches philanthropy less as a handout than as an investment. “We’re very results-oriented, data-driven, outcome-focused. We took all the lessons from business and treat every grant like an investment,” he said, adding that he and his wife have other significant announcements to come. “I’ve had the opportunity to create a significant impact on the world through Dell Technologies, but the goal that we’ve set is that we want our philanthropy to have an even bigger impact.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Anthropic preps for an IPO Anthropic has reportedly hired lawyers from Wilson Sonsini for an upcoming IPO that could be one of the largest listings ever.

Further and 3iQ have launched a $100 million market-neutral crypto hedge fund for institutions, including a Bitcoin share class that reinvests gains in BTC. United Arab Emirates-based digital asset manager Further Asset Management has partnered with Canadian crypto investment firm 3iQ to launch a $100 million hedge fund targeting institutional investors seeking structured exposure to cryptocurrencies, including a Bitcoin-denominated share class that reinvests gains directly into BTC. According to a Wednesday announcement, the Further x 3iQ Alpha Digital Fund is a market-neutral, multi-strategy vehicle designed to deliver risk-managed exposure to liquid crypto markets under an institutional framework. The fund was seeded with capital from institutional investors, family offices and sovereign backers. “We’re providing institutional-grade, risk-managed and scalable access to digital assets, including Bitcoin, within a structure that has successfully passed the rigorous institutional due diligence of leading global capital allocators,” said Faisal Al Hammadi, managing partner at Further. Pascal St-Jean, president and CEO of 3iQ, said that the fund’s structure enables investors to “confidently pursue double-digit potential returns.” Related: Goldman Sachs buys Innovator, adds Bitcoin-linked ETF to lineup One of the fund’s key features is its dedicated Bitcoin (BTC) share class, which allows qualifying investors to subscribe in BTC and receive returns in the same denomination. The share class was anchored by a large in-kind contribution from an unidentified Abu Dhabi-based family office, providing participants with exposure designed to steadily increase Bitcoin holdings while maintaining long-term exposure to the asset. Founded in 2012, 3iQ focuses on regulated products and services tailored for institutional and professional investors seeking exposure to digital assets within traditional compliance frameworks. The company has been expanding its institutional crypto offering through infrastructure including its Digital Assets Managed Account Platform.

Title: Lightning in a Bottle

Time Published: 2025-12-03T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Electricity is a public good, dating back to when rural electrification was a pressing need for the nation during the New Deal era. Yet control over this essential service today rests largely in the hands of private monopolies known as investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which provide power to nearly 70 percent of utility customers in the U.S. These monopolies are regulated at the state level by public utility commissions, which are responsible for setting rates. Utilities must justify any rate increases and convince regulators of the need for their actions. But 2025 may be the year that this regulatory framework collapses under its own contradictions. More from James Baratta In just the first half of the year, IOUs requested approval for an unprecedented $29 billion in additional revenue. They cited growing electricity demand, including from data centers powering artificial intelligence, needed upgrades to aging infrastructure, and mandates to decarbonize in several states. Yet rate hikes have also translated into skyrocketing CEO compensation and record-breaking profits for shareholders. And in many parts of the country, IOU rates are rising much faster than those of their municipally owned counterparts. This has put unbearable weight on customers. Electric bills are increasing at twice the rate of inflation on average. More than 52 million Americans were unable to pay their electric bills at least once last year, and on an annual basis, roughly three million people who cannot afford these bills have their electricity shut off. The myriad factors driving up electricity demand are “actually just shining a spotlight on the fundamental design of the utility system,” Isaac Sevier, founder and executive director of Public Grids, told the Prospect. And that design is badly broken, with public utility commissions either too confused or too captured to resist an onslaught of IOU pressure to approve rate hikes. Sevier believes this necessitates a rethink of how utilities deliver power in the U.S., and how to protect those who pay for it. He wants to restore a promising and proven alternative—public power. The movement to reclaim democratic control over utilities has cemented itself in communities across the country. In their outreach, public power advocates have connected soaring electricity prices with the need to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system, one that decouples investment planning from shareholder profits. ACCORDING TO CONSULTING FIRM ICF, load growth in the U.S. is projected to increase by 25 percent over the next five years. One of the biggest and most scrutinized factors for this is the historic expansion of data centers. Big Tech hyperscalers plan to spend up to $400 billion on the data center build-out just this year. To meet the colossal demand for AI and cloud services, data centers will more than double their 2024 energy consumption by the end of the decade. Just keeping up with all that demand would be costly for utilities. But a number of other issues are converging at once to squeeze the system. For instance, adding more power would meet demand and keep rates low, but interconnection queues can take years to hook up energy sources. As Grist reported, utilities “are now putting more than half of their expenditures into transmission and distribution through the end of the decade.” This has led to shortages of critical grid assets. More critically, IOUs have been slow to implement transformative upgrades like non-wires alternatives, which reduce reliance on traditional transmission infrastructure, and are instead plowing capital into legacy assets like poles and wires, with customers footing the bill. The IOU financial model disincentivizes grid improvements that would simply make things more efficient, as the Department of Energy (DOE) acknowledged in a report last year. Unlike investments in traditional infrastructure, modernizing the grid does not contribute to the growth of a utility’s rate base. Information asymmetry between utility commissions and utilities has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Tariffs on metals like steel and aluminum have put upward pressure on construction expenses, further stalling grid upgrades and making it more costly to rebuild after disaster strikes. Hardening the grid is already an expensive endeavor ratepayers must finance. In California, utilities have spent more on underground transmission lines and passed insurance costs on to customers, while utilities in the Southeast have been known to seek higher rates to cover the cost of rebuilding after hurricanes. As the Trump administration pursues its policy of “American energy dominance,” the U.S. has continued to export more natural gas than it imports and is actively expanding its export capacity. That presents another problem for ratepayers, who find themselves more exposed to global gas market price swings. In 2022, U.S. households saw electric bills go up by almost 15 percent when the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused gas prices to spike. Trump’s full-frontal assault on renewables threatens to drive up electricity prices even further. Over the summer, he ordered the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce” the termination of wind and solar energy credits. In other words, it is now official policy to make clean-energy projects, which accounted for almost all new U.S. electrical generating capacity in the first four months of 2025, as unprofitable as possible. Fitting this together, you have the elements of a perfect storm: There’s a greater need for power at precisely the moment when there are limits, both real and artificial, on how much supply can be added. But against the backdrop of these factors, the IOUs are using their immense influence to push for even higher rates than the economic fundamentals would indicate. As a result, faith in the regulatory compact appears to be waning. IOUs ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A REGULATORY SYSTEM they built for themselves decades ago. They enabled the concept of public utility commissions as the electricity industry was built in the early 20th century, vowing that this setup would keep the rapaciousness of the profit motive in check. In reality, the idea was to cement private ownership of utilities and resist municipal control. And it set the stage for the shenanigans that we see today. “The whole thing is like the emperor’s new clothes,” said Mark Ellis, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project and an independent expert witness who testifies before state utility commissions. In a recent report, Ellis provided evidence that unwarranted rate increases cost customers $50 billion per year, or about $300 for every U.S. household. “Many people know what’s going on is wrong,” he said, “but they’re all playing along because they’re afraid to call it out.” In his past life, Ellis was the chief economist at Sempra Energy, a consultant with McKinsey, an analyst for ExxonMobil, and an engineer for SoCal Edison. At times, he feels like the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale who says aloud what others know but won’t admit. Regulators set electricity rates through a process known as cost-of-service regulation. The ratemaking process, in theory, is a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, public utility commissions that review utilities’ requests have the goal of ensuring that any rate increases are just and reasonable. On the other, they are pressured to set rates high enough so utilities can cover operating costs, maintenance, and expansion projects. The rate charged for electricity is supposed to equal operating costs, the cost of the capital investment, and a “just and reasonable” profit; in sum, this is known as the rate of return. All shareholder-owned companies finance their capital expenditures through a blend of debt and equity; IOUs are no different. Calculating a utility’s cost of debt is relatively straightforward, but its cost of equity, which is not directly observable, must be estimated. This becomes a key variable, and the way that additional capital expenditures can translate into higher profits. Even in the context of needing massive upgrades to decarbonize and meet expanding demand, IOUs are overinvesting, typically in the kinds of activities that don’t benefit consumers or the environment, but instead juice returns. The Supreme Court has long upheld that rate of return should equal the “cost of capital,” as determined by financial markets. Yet any cursory look at the stock prices of major IOUs shows that something is wrong. These staid, low-risk companies that are supposed to be earning tightly regulated profits are actually some of the most dazzling gainers on Wall Street. An RMI report earlier this year found that the top 20 IOUs were trading at an 81 percent premium, because their return on equity was far higher than their cost of equity. The canyon of information asymmetry between public utility commissions and the utilities they regulate has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Four consulting firms, Ellis says, scour the country to testify in 90 percent of all commission rate cases, using economic models to estimate rates of return that are not used in any other area of finance. Ellis acknowledges that the legal standard “doesn’t necessarily say what model to use,” but in his paper, he explains that the models IOUs use seem to be a means to an end. For example, many consultants use an “expected earnings” analysis that arrives at a rate of return based primarily on future forecasts that the company expects to receive, a totally circular analysis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission banned the expected earnings model from use in federal hearings in 2022, but it continues to be used at the state level. Whenever ratepayer advocates use their own witnesses and their own economic models, they come up with wildly different figures for what the rate of return should be. They are so different, in fact, that most public utility commissions wind up throwing those numbers out, so committed are they to utility industry dogma. Herein lies the fundamental ratemaking dilemma: Public utility commissions have seldom acted as a fiscal boundary to minimize operating costs. In fact, it’s just the opposite. There are signs that policymakers are beginning to get fed up with the continued burdening of the public with higher costs, without improvements to grid reliability that might justify them. This past year, lawmakers in six states introduced measures to limit utilities’ return on equity, the key variable that is overestimated to give utilities excess profits. Legislation in New York and Rhode Island seeks to cap return on equity at 4 percent, while legislators in Massachusetts and New Jersey have proposed new regulatory guidance that would require public utility commissions to minimize return on equity. To keep rates just and reasonable, enhance reliability, and accelerate the energy transition, Ellis launched MarketClear Utility Capital with the goal of delivering attractive returns on utility assets without shifting unnecessary costs onto ratepayers. In conjunction, he has proposed a new investment model for regulated utilities: competitive direct equity (CDE). IOUs generate roughly $2 in shareholder value for every dollar they invest in infrastructure. CDE would eliminate this “capital bias,” which is the driving force behind utility overinvestment. The idea is to establish a market for equity capital that links financial incentives to regulatory outcomes and affordability by replacing “the current system of regulators setting utility returns with actual market competition for utility equity investment,” Ellis wrote in a Real Clear Energy article he co-authored in October. “Under CDE, utilities would earn only their actual market-based cost of capital, removing the reward for excess spending,” he continued. “With capital bias eliminated, regulators could implement meaningful performance-based incentives that are better aligned with the public interest.” WHEN PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS TAKE the rare step of striving to keep rates just and reasonable, they risk their careers. According to the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI), IOUs “often use donations to charitable organizations as a means to encourage organizations to support their political agenda.” Avangrid, which owns electric and gas utilities in Connecticut, has been especially combative toward the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). In 2023, several charitable organizations receiving donations from the Avangrid Foundation called on PURA to “moderate” a draft decision in which regulators rejected a rate hike requested by the company’s Connecticut-based subsidiary, United Illuminating. PURA upheld the decision. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Allegations lodged against Avangrid President and CEO Pedro Azagra Blázquez suggest he made “thinly veiled” efforts to pressure PURA to play ball. In a letter first obtained by CT Mirror, PURA General Counsel Scott Muska accused Azagra Blázquez of implying that the company would reduce its investment in the state if commissioners continued to hand down “adverse rulings.” Muska also alleged that Azagra Blázquez had offered opportunities for “international exposure” to then-PURA Chair Marissa P. Gillett in exchange for her support. (The Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola is Avangrid’s parent company.) Gillett resigned from her post this past fall following intense backlash—particularly by Avangrid—over her efforts to boost cost savings and modernize Connecticut’s approach to ratemaking through performance-based regulation (PBR), which despite its flaws, is premised on realigning utilities’ incentive structure with the public interest. Under Gillett’s leadership, PURA reined in IOU profit margins, advanced its Equitable Modern Grid initiative, and created the Office of Education, Outreach and Enforcement, “which has become a national model for public engagement and is even being replicated in other states and at the federal level,” she wrote in her resignation letter. Utilities took PURA to the state Supreme Court five times during her tenure, all of them ending in PURA victories. Other lawsuits remain active. The pushback on Gillett’s attempts at reform was a constant, including public records requests designed to embarrass her and her team. Opponents claimed that Gillett sought to restrict access to staff from other members of the commission, and one state lawmaker threatened impeachment proceedings and suggested that Gillett lied under oath. The series of episodes “exacted a real emotional toll both for me personally, as well as my family, and for my team,” Gillett wrote in her letter. “I did not make this decision lightly, but there is only so much that one individual can reasonably endure, or ask of their family, while doing their best to serve our state.” Meanwhile, the lucrative nature of the modern utility industry has drawn in a troubling yet familiar face: private equity. The core incentive of the IOU financial model ties profit to capital spending. Private equity ownership turbocharges this incentive. In theory, a private equity owner could generate multiplicative returns by piling on debt and accelerating a utility’s capital deployment. Utilities also enjoy predictable cash flows and guaranteed cost recovery. That bodes well for BlackRock and Blackstone, which have been pursuing utility acquisitions to cash in on the AI data center boom. In October, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission met to approve BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ acquisition of ALLETE, the parent company of Minnesota Power. Previously, Ellis had testified before this commission, arguing that the transaction “proves, unequivocally, that Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return is excessive, and that excessive [rates of return] are the key motivation for the transaction and the root cause of the forecast unprecedented rate increases.” But a settlement between ALLETE and the Minnesota Department of Commerce, endorsing the sale, made the October proceeding in St. Paul all but a formality. When I attended the hearing, a fellow journalist was approached by an attorney for the buyers, Dan Lipschultz. He used to be on the commission, revealing a popular tactic for industry: hiring former regulators to influence their ex-colleagues. During deliberations, commissioners assured critics that they had the authority to hold the buyers accountable if anything untoward happened. “I really became convinced … when I realized that the goal here was to grow this Minnesota company,” said Commissioner John Tuma, who was initially a skeptic of the deal. He cited organized labor’s support; it had already been reported that Lipschultz ghostwrote a comment letter from the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters and International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49. Tuma also cited another benefit from the BlackRock purchase: the possibility of a new utility owner willing to make investments being attractive to data centers. In the end, the vote was unanimous in support of the acquisition. As part of the $6.2 billion deal, Global Infrastructure Partners made several commitments, including a one-year moratorium on rate increases and a modest reduction to its authorized return on equity. But critics argue the concessions are not enough to prevent excessive rate increases over the long term. “Even with concessions made, the deal is still a bad deal for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, an expert witness in the case, said at the time. THE INABILITY OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS to keep costs down for customers sits squarely at the center of the affordability crisis. It also reflects the failure of technocratic liberalization, which as Sevier observed in an October report he co-authored, “has failed at its core promise of increasing competition, without lowering costs for working people, stabilizing costs, making services more reliable, increasing energy conservation, reducing private utility opposition to rooftop solar, and slowing upward wealth redistribution.” If regulatory capture is to blame, what might a viable alternative look like? “Public power is the most sensible solution to answer these big questions,” Sevier told the Prospect. This idea has appealed to a growing number of community organizers across the country who contend that cutting shareholders out of the equation would free up additional resources to strengthen the grid, enhance reliability, ease ratepayers’ debt burdens, and expand benefits for workers. There are existing models going back centuries that have delivered cheaper power and maintained energy democracy with public input. “We’re part of a national movement … something that gets lost a little bit when you’re working at a local level,” Jessica Cook, an organizer with Milwaukee DSA’s Power to the People campaign, told the Prospect. Cook is also legislative assistant to Alderperson Alex Brower, who represents the city’s Third District. The first socialist to win a Milwaukee Common Council seat in 77 years, Brower campaigned on replacing We Energies, an investor-owned electric and gas utility that serves more than two million Wisconsinites. Greater Milwaukee is its largest service area. “We Energies acts like they own this town,” Brower said in an interview with the Prospect. “People are fed up, and they’ve realized the profit motive driving We Energies is to blame.” In the last three years, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved two consecutive rate increases: an 8.8 percent base-rate increase, effective January 2023, and a cumulative increase of 12.38 percent for 2025 and 2026. “People are already hurting,” Alexander Hagler, a 35-year-old Milwaukee resident and owner of Kuumba Juice & Coffee, told the Prospect. “Electricity is like the air we breathe,” he added, describing it as one of the “many different resources in our society that we need to bring under the control of the people.” Power to the People, which started in Milwaukee three years ago, has called on the city to replace We Energies with a municipal or cooperative utility, which would require a majority vote from the Milwaukee Common Council. Organizers have proposed funding the acquisition through tax-exempt municipal bonds, lowering the cost of capital without jeopardizing the city’s credit rating so long as a dedicated utility enterprise fund is established. The campaign runs weekly canvasses and phone banks, speaking directly to ratepayers’ frustration and offering an established alternative. “People are looking for something,” said Audra Hale, an organizer with Power to the People and at-large executive committee member at Milwaukee DSA. The day before we spoke, Hale and other canvassers collected over 300 signatures for the campaign’s petition to replace We Energies at a local No Kings Day protest. Nearly 14,000 people have now signed that petition, which Brower will eventually submit to the Common Council. “We’re trying to convince my colleagues that this is a good idea,” Brower said, adding that Power to the People has been “doubling down” on canvassing in districts whose alderpersons “can be moved.” To date, no other alderpersons have come out to publicly support the campaign. With an election coming up in 2026, Milwaukee DSA is trying to change that by endorsing candidates who support Power to the People and running challengers against those who do not. During a canvass in late October, volunteers split into two groups to collect signatures in District 6. I tagged along with the second group; we stopped at four different laundromats. Among the volunteers was Andy Barbour, co-chair of Milwaukee DSA. He spoke with a resident who, having been a We Energies employee, declined to sign the petition due to concerns over their pension. But the message seemed to stick; Barbour was pleasantly surprised when that same resident convinced a friend to sign on. At one point, another resident who added her name to the petition claimed that We Energies had shut off her electricity after she missed a payment. “They suck … We’ve got to come together,” she said. By 3 p.m., canvassers had collected close to 60 signatures. Despite the “success rate” of its canvasses, Barbour said Power to the People will need to “prepare for the fights ahead, because we know they are coming.” UTILITIES HAVE SPENT BIG TO PREVENT public power campaigns from gaining traction in communities across the country. “Utilities are trying to make it as difficult as possible for cities to liberate themselves from corporations who do not care about actually delivering affordable service [and] would rather enrich themselves to increase returns for their shareholders,” said Shelby Green, a research and communications manager at EPI. And they have been successful. As Maine Public reported, the parent companies of Central Maine Power and Versant Power spent tens of millions of dollars to defeat public power at the ballot box in 2023. Avangrid, which also owns Central Maine Power, contributed more than $18 million to the paradoxically named utility front group Maine Affordable Energy, while Maine Energy Progress received approximately $15 million from Enmax, the parent company of Versant Power. Our Power, the advocacy group behind the municipalization effort, only raised about $236,000. Yet as electric rates skyrocket, this spending may mean nothing to angry voters. In Georgia, an industry front group called Power for Tomorrow spent almost $200,000 this year around the Georgia Public Service Commission race, an off-year special election where two Republican incumbents who had approved six rate increases over a two-year period were running for re-election. Democrats Alicia M. Johnson and Peter Hubbard campaigned on affordability and reliability, laying the blame for recent rate increases on excessive profit margins and the slow pace of decarbonization. Despite the spending against them, they became the first Democrats in Georgia to win a nonfederal statewide election in nearly 20 years, smoking the Republican incumbents by 26 points. “Affordability is front and center in voters’ minds, and today they overwhelmingly said they’re tired of subsidizing corporate interests at the expense of their families,” Hubbard said on election night. With affordability front and center, the public power movement has an opportunity to reclaim the narrative around public power. Next year, Ann Arbor for Public Power will submit a ballot proposal asking voters to create a consumer-owned utility that would replace DTE Energy, an electric and gas utility holding company serving more than three million customers across southeastern Michigan. Meanwhile, public power organizers in Clearwater, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona, pressed local officials to rigorously consider municipalization after the cities had commissioned feasibility studies. In September, the Clearwater City Council authorized an appraisal process to further evaluate the viability of a consumer-owned utility. (We Stand for Energy, a utility front group backed by the Edison Electric Institute, promptly blasted the idea in a social media ad campaign.) “The electricity system connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric,” Sevier said. “We have to rebuild trust and to demonstrate that our infrastructure can serve a public good, not a private profit.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. There are, of course, two components to affordability: sellers’ prices and buyers’ incomes. For most American families, buying (or renting) focuses either heavily or entirely on life’s essentials: housing, food, transportation, education, health care, and other forms of care (child, senior). That a clear majority of American families are, at minimum, stressed by these costs is a consequence of not just a host of factors on the sellers’ side, but of one big factor on the buyers’ side: a half-century of wage stagnation, even as investment income has soared. Or, if you prefer, a half-century of buyers’ income stagnation, even as sellers’ income has soared. More from Harold Meyerson If you depend on investments for most of your income, this is a pretty damn good time. The University of Michigan’s November survey of consumer sentiment finds that Americans who don’t own stock have their lowest confidence level in the economy since the survey began querying stock ownership in 1998. An exception to this mood, the survey notes, is found among the largest stock owners, whose assessment of the economy has actually risen by 11 percent this year. As Emma Janssen has reported in these pages, marketers are going where the money is, like bank robber Willie Sutton. First-class and business-seat travel on the airlines is booming, so much so that seating arrangements on Delta and United are being reconfigured to create more room for the affluent, while coach seats are going unfilled and “discount” airlines struggle. Revenues are up 3 percent this year at the Ritz-Carltons, the Four Seasons, and other luxury hotels, yet down by 3 percent at economy hotels. And when it comes to life’s biggest purchase—a home—the median age of first-time buyers reached 40 this year, an all-time high according to the National Association of Realtors. “All right,” as John Dos Passos wrote in his U.S.A. trilogy in the depth of the Depression, “we are two nations.” Life in the nonaffluent nation is getting harder. According to a Brookings Institution analysis from last year, 43 percent of American families don’t earn enough to pay for housing, food, health care, child care, and transportation; every week, they must juggle which to pay and which not to pay. Among Black and Latino families, those figures rise to 59 percent and 66 percent, respectively. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. It has not been ever thus. In the roughly 30 years following the end of World War II, the nation experienced an unprecedented period of broadly shared prosperity, with workers’ incomes rising in tandem with the nation’s growth in productivity. In 1947, workers captured 70 percent of the total national income; today, that has fallen to roughly 59 percent, while investment income has gained at workers’ expense. As a landmark 1995 study by economists Larry Mishel and Jared Bernstein for the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) revealed, a gap between the rise in productivity and the rise in median workers’ wages opened in the mid-1970s and has grown steadily wider since then; the difference between those two rates today is 55 percent. In the years between 1948 and 1979, when the egalitarian legacy of the New Deal was at its apogee, with high levels of unionization and progressive taxation and constraints on the financial sector, productivity grew by 108 percent and median worker’s compensation by 93 percent. In the years between 1979 and 2025, an EPI analysis found productivity grew by 87 percent but median worker’s compensation by a bare 33 percent. The declining share of national income going to workers hasn’t entirely been the result of the shift from wage income to investment income. There’s also been a shift in the distribution of corporate income to the most highly paid employees, through stock options and other forms of compensation. A 2021 EPI study shows that between 1979 and 2019, real yearly wages for the bottom 90 percent of workers increased by 26 percent, while the wages of those in the 95th to 99th percentile increased by 75 percent, for those in the top 1 percent by 160 percent, and for those in the top 0.1 percent by 345 percent. Worker pay ratios over the past decade have shown that CEOs usually make about 300 times what their median-paid employee makes, a far cry from the 1960s, when the ratio was roughly 20-to-1. Even as labor unions have largely disappeared in the past 60 years, the union of American CEOs—routinely appointed to the executive compensation committees of corporate boards with the blessing or at the instigation of the CEO whose pay they’re setting—has retained its power, adhering to the creed that an injury to one CEO (by, say, paying him or her less than 300 times what workers make) is an injury to all. What would America look like if the gap between worker pay and productivity hadn’t opened? A RAND Corporation study from earlier this year found that the bottom 90 percent of wage earners received about 67 percent of all taxable income in 1975. In 2019, the last year for which this data was available, they received 46.8 percent. Had that bottom 90 percent continued during the past half-century to make the same share of the national income they’d had in 1975, RAND calculates that by 2023 they would have made an additional $79 trillion. Just in the year 2023, they would have made an additional $3.9 trillion. As the size of the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. workforce is roughly 140 million people, that means that the average earner would have made about $28,000 more in 2023 than they actually did. Where have all those missing $28,000 paychecks gone? Well, our nation was home to 1,135 billionaires this year, whose aggregate net worth in 2024 came to a cozy $5.7 trillion. That’s $1.8 trillion more than what it would take to cut 140 million $28,000 paychecks. Corporations aren’t cutting those checks. As EPI’s Nominal Wage Tracker documents, the 80 percent of corporate income that went to employees in 1980 declined to 71.5 percent this year. This is the kind of thing that can irritate workers. As I write in mid-November, 3,200 members of the Machinists union have just completed a three-month strike at three Midwestern Boeing plants. Strikers noted that Boeing devoted $68 billion to stock buybacks between 2010 and 2024—funds that could have gone to developing safer and better planes, and better-compensated workers with more secure retirement benefits. THERE’S A REASON WHY 1979 HAS BECOME the last “postwar normal” year, before the massive upward redistribution of wealth and income, in most of these economic studies. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In his first few months in office, he signed a law reducing the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. (It’s about ten points lower than that today, though most of our super-rich have found ways to get it much closer to zero.) The high marginal tax rates of the postwar decades, peaking at 91 percent during Republican Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency, had effectively put a ceiling on CEO pay. Tesla’s board would not be committing to pay Elon Musk a trillion bucks if Tesla thrives in the coming years under 1950s-era tax rates, where the feds would take the lion’s share above the top marginal bracket. The pre-Reagan tax rates ensured that America’s billionaires would be few and far between, helping to ensure that workers’ potential income wouldn’t be siphoned upward. Twenty years after Reagan, George W. Bush became the first president to lower taxes on the rich during wartime (a war he decided to start absent a plausible threat), and Donald Trump’s successive cuts make even Reagan and Bush look like Keynesians. In 1982, Reagan’s appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) changed a rule that enabled shareholders to claim a greater percentage of corporate wealth. The SEC permitted corporate executives to authorize buybacks of the corporation’s stock, thereby raising the value of the remaining shares on the market. By the 1990s, due to a Clinton-era loophole exempting bonus compensation from corporate taxes, corporations began paying their top executives with shares and options of shares, which made buybacks an easy form of self-enrichment. As economist William Lazonick has exhaustively documented, by the 2000s, most major corporations were diverting more funds to buybacks and dividends than they were investing in growth and research, not to mention employees’ raises. During his first year in office, Reagan also busted PATCO, the air traffic controllers’ union, firing all its members when they went on strike. (By contrast, Republican Richard Nixon had allowed all hundreds of thousands of postal workers who’d participated in a wildcat strike in 1970 to return to their jobs: The Republican Party of Nixon’s day was still closer to the accept-the-New-Deal ethos of Eisenhower than the overturn-the-New-Deal ethos of Reagan.) Reagan’s mass firing inspired private-sector CEOs to do the same with their own employees. During the next several years, a representative sample of leading corporations—Phelps Dodge, Greyhound Bus, Boise Cascade, International Paper, Hormel meatpacking—all slashed pay to provoke strikes, then fired the strikers and hired their replacements at a fraction of their original salaries. During the years of postwar prosperity, strikes were a routine part of the economic landscape, and a major reason why worker pay constituted a decent share of the national income. After PATCO, they nearly disappeared. The number of major strikes plummeted from 286 a year in the 1960s and 1970s, to 83 a year in the 1980s, to 35 a year in the 1990s, to 20 a year in the 2000s. In recent years, the strike has enjoyed a modest revival—autoworkers and teaching assistants have won higher wages by walking picket lines—but unions have shrunk to the point that the fruits of such victories have limited ripple effects. Reagan wasn’t the sole agent of upward redistribution during this time. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker brought down inflation by raising interest rates so high that people stopped buying cars and construction projects slowed to a trickle. The industrial Midwest never recovered. Between 1979 and 1983, 2.4 million manufacturing jobs vanished. The number of U.S. steelworkers went from 450,000 at the start of the 1980s to 170,000 at decade’s end, even as the wages of those who remained shrank by 17 percent. The decline in auto manufacturing was even more precipitous, from 760,000 employees in 1978 to 490,000 three years later. These were the jobs whose union contracts had set the standard for the nation’s blue-collar workers. Finally, also in 1981, at New York’s Pierre Hotel, Jack Welch, General Electric’s new CEO, delivered a kind of inaugural address, which he titled “Growing Fast in a Slow-Growth Economy.” GE, Welch proclaimed, would shed all its divisions that weren’t number one or number two in their markets. If that meant shedding workers, so be it. All that mattered was pushing the company to pre-eminence, and the measure of a company’s pre-eminence was its stock price. Between late 1980 and 1985, Welch reduced the number of GE employees from 411,000 to 299,000. He cut basic research. The company’s stock price soared. And Welch became the model CEO for a corporate America going fully neoliberal. WHAT THE EARLY 1980S INAUGURATED GREW APACE over the subsequent 40 years. Emboldened by Reagan’s opposition to unions, CEOs and corporate boards routinely directed their companies to violate the laws that had empowered workers to form and join unions. In 2016 and 2017, employers were charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act in 41.5 percent of all unionization campaigns, often by firing workers involved in those campaigns. The penalties for being found guilty of such charges are negligible, and Democrats’ efforts to amend the NLRA so that the penalties actually have some effect on employer conduct have never been able to win the support of the 60 senators required to break a filibuster to enact such amendments. So it is that most unionized private companies were unionized many decades ago, and almost all the major companies that have been created since (including the two largest private-sector employers, Walmart and Amazon) have rebuffed their employees’ unionization efforts through illegal threats and firings. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Even when workers have managed to win unionization, that doesn’t mean they actually are able to bargain a first contract. An EPI study showed that 63 percent of the time during 2018, workers in newly unionized companies hadn’t been able to get their employer to agree to a contract within one year of their unionizing, as there’s no law requiring employers to bargain in a timely fashion. Amazon, for instance, has yet even to begin bargaining with the Staten Island warehouse workers, who decisively voted to join a union to much fanfare back in April of 2022. These are among the factors that explain why the rate of American worker unionization has declined from one-third in the middle of the 20th century to just under 10 percent today, and a bare 6 percent in the private sector. Another factor, both in the shrinking of unions and the shrinking of worker pay, is the move of major corporations’ production facilities from the unionized Northern and Midwestern states to the right-to-work, anti-union South. The spread of Southern pay standards to the rest of the nation—a tale whose protagonist is most certainly Walmart—also served to bring down national pay levels in retail. The late 1970s deregulation of the trucking industry, by effectively negating the Teamsters’ nationwide contract with long-distance trucking companies that had covered nearly half of U.S. truck drivers, proved to be a huge hit to drivers’ incomes, by some estimates cutting them in half. This November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. Trade deals and offshoring have damaged workers considerably. NAFTA was the nation’s first trade treaty with a low-wage nation (Mexico), and our end-of-the-century trade deal with China greatly exacerbated the depressing effect on American workers’ wages. Both an EPI study and another by MIT’s David Autor and several co-authors independently concluded that such deals lowered the wage of non-college-graduate U.S. workers by 5.6 percent, taking an average bite out of their yearly income of roughly $2,000. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 currently comes to roughly 29 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. In 1968, the federal minimum wage came to 53 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. Worker misclassification as independent contractors (as in the cases of Amazon delivery drivers and Uber and Lyft drivers) reduces incomes, exempts workers from wage and hour legislation, and generally means they lack the benefits (such as health insurance) that customarily accrue to corporate employees. EPI’s 2021 study on the factors reducing workers’ income estimated that nine million American workers were then misclassified, reducing their incomes by anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent. A 2019 study by Brandeis University economist David Weil, who was in charge of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor during the Obama presidency, found that drivers employed directly by UPS, who also worked under a contract with the Teamsters, earned $23.10 an hour, while the “independent contractor” drivers for FedEx earned $14.40 an hour, and those for Amazon, a paltry $5.30 an hour. Amazon is currently in court contesting the unionization of a number of those drivers, making the argument that the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional. Noncompete agreements tucked into employment contracts forbid workers from taking a job with other businesses in the same sector or starting their own businesses in that sector. Initially devised to keep a small number of specialized employees from taking proprietary information to competitor companies, these agreements have now spread to workers at nail salons, barbershops, and just about any other kind of business. An EPI survey of businesses with at least 50 employees found that somewhere between one-quarter and one-half of all private-sector workers were subject to noncompetes. During the Biden presidency, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the NLRB found this practice to be a violation of law, and the FTC formally banned noncompetes nationwide. But those findings and rules have not been carried over, of course, to their Trump administration successors. Corporate concentration, as the other feature articles in this issue abundantly document, is a huge factor in price increases afflicting the American consumer. It’s also a factor in limiting American workers’ incomes. In 2017, MIT’s Autor and other co-authors estimated that the increase in product market concentration accounted for a third of the decline in labor’s share of the national income for the years between 1997 and 2012. The shrinking of employer options relieves employers of the pressure created by workers flocking to higher-paying rivals. In opposing the merger of the Albertsons and Kroger supermarket chains, Biden’s FTC argued that it would lead not only to price hikes but also to lower wages for their workers unless they remained separate companies. In weighing the relative responsibility of all these factors in creating the widening gap between productivity increases and median wage increases from 1979 through 2017, a 2021 EPI study by Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens concluded that excessive unemployment levels (due chiefly to Federal Reserve policies), the decline of collective bargaining, and globalization (devised by and benefiting corporations) explain roughly 55 percent of that gap, while misclassification of workers, subcontracting, noncompete agreements, and corporate concentration add up to 20 percent. OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS, THE FUNDAMENTALS of the postwar economy that were put in place by the New Deal have been discarded at the behest and insistence of wealthy interests and individuals who’ve sought a much higher share of the national income. Creating a more equitable economy—effectively, reinventing a vibrant American middle class—will be an arduous task. That said, this November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The affordability solutions put forth by Zohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, and Mikie Sherrill in their successful campaigns are just a start in what will be a long and difficult struggle. Herewith, some suggestions on the path to a more broadly shared prosperity and an affordable future. First, nothing increases worker bargaining power like full employment. The next Democratic president’s appointees to the Federal Reserve must be committed to raising ordinary Americans’ share of the national income. That requires the low interest rates essential for a thriving economy. Denmark’s policy of providing free job training and up to 90 percent of their salary to laid-off workers has been a success in boosting that nation’s employment levels and mitigating the effects of an economic downturn. Second, the return of collective bargaining. That necessitates labor law reforms that enable workers to unionize by signing affiliation cards; require employers to recognize unions when their workers have obtained those cards from a majority of employees; require employers to settle on contracts with unionized workers within a fixed time (90 days? 120 days?) or submit to compulsory arbitration; abolish “right to work” laws; make corporations the co-employers of record with their franchises; enable sector-wide bargaining in various sectors, thereby setting the same minimum wage and benefit standards for all of that industry’s employees, unionized or not; and perhaps enable bargaining from “minority” unions to which at least 25 percent of employees belong, so long as no union has achieved majority status. Today, unions are among the most well-thought-of American institutions, getting roughly 70 percent approval ratings in the annual Gallup polls, even as the rate of private-sector unionization is less than one-tenth of that. It’s primarily the weakness of labor law that has spawned this widest of gaps; that law must be changed if that gap is to shrink. Third, raise the minimum wage to the level of a living wage, sufficient to pay for all life’s essentials. An MIT study this year has estimated the living wage for a family in each of the 50 states, from $22.43 an hour in Mississippi to $34.55 in California. A federal law could mandate such procedures for the states. A paper released in October by California-based economists Martin Carnoy, Michael Reich, and Derek Shearer suggests an anti-inflationary accompaniment to such raises would be a rigorous antitrust policy that would yield more competitive pricing in retailing. Fourth, family-friendly financial policies. That could begin with a yearly federal payment to families with children, at an initial level of $5,000 per child. A Brookings Institution study has estimated that a middle-income family spends $310,605 to raise one child from birth to 17. The cost of child-rearing is such that it simply deters many families from having children. This is an area where our government must adopt the kind of policies that the governments of most nations with advanced economies have long since enacted. Universal free child care and pre-kindergarten could cut these costs to families, as well as enabling mothers to continue in their careers, which boosts family incomes. In a recent paper for the Economic Security Project, Becky Chao and Mike Konczal document that Americans generally become parents when their earnings have yet to achieve mid-career levels, making the prospect of having children a financially fraught one. They argue for substantial child tax credits and earned income tax credits to address this structural gap between the costs of parenting and the income levels of young workers. Similarly, they also argue for more generous Social Security payments for the elderly and disabled. Fifth, a ban on noncompete and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Sixth, the adoption of industrial policies, such as those advanced during the Biden administration, that revitalize domestic industries and lessen our dependence on imports from low-wage nations that have the effect of reducing the incomes of workers here at home. As the robotization of production work continues, manufacturing and transportation will employ fewer workers than they currently do, but the remaining workers in those sectors should not have their incomes reduced either by foreign competition or by the kinds of employment arrangements and opposition to unions that currently characterize our economy. Where unions have power, they can insist that smaller workforces receive the benefits of higher productivity, as the longshore unions have succeeded in doing during the past decades of mechanization and containerization, making their members’ jobs the highest-paying blue-collar jobs in America. Seventh, a thorough reworking of our tax system. Higher taxes on the rich and corporations are clearly needed to fund the kind of programs listed above, and with the nation’s wealth disparities reaching stratospheric proportions, some form of wealth taxes must be adopted as well. The best argument for adopting such a tax is that right now, only the most common and widely held form of wealth—homes—is subjected to that kind of tax. If we can tax the wealth of middle-income families, why can’t we tax the wealth—such as stocks and other investments—of the truly wealthy? Certainly, the capital gains tax should be raised to the level of the income tax on work, and the SEC rule on buybacks should be revoked. None of this will happen so long as money dominates our politics, so the Supreme Court decisions enabling that domination—Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo—should be undone, if not by Democratic-appointed successors to the current justices, then by other work-arounds, such as the current effort in Montana to rewrite the state’s corporate charters so they deny corporations the power to involve themselves in elections. Americans increasingly understand that our current economy isn’t meeting their interests and that it’s rigged to favor the wealthy. A sizable public will welcome candidates who expand the Overton window of economic reforms such as those suggested here, just as there were sizable publics that backed the reforms laid out by Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani in their campaigns. Indeed, a national YouGov poll taken one week after Mamdani’s election showed that every one of his platform planks commanded majority support from the American people, including 69 percent support for raising taxes on corporations and millionaires, 66 percent support for free child care for children from six months to five years, and even 57 percent support for government-owned grocery stores. There’s no reason why Democrats who don’t call themselves socialists can’t do well running on such reforms. This would be a very opportune time for them to start.

Title: Are Bitcoin ETF inflows finally back after IBIT ETF’s 7% jump?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=550923
Time Published: 2025-12-03T09:00:38Z
Full Content:
Is Bitcoin’s ‘Santa rally’ back, or will Japan spoil the party? Bitcoin’s [BTC] price jumped over 8% to over $93K in the past 24 hours, at press time, following renewed ETF inflows led by BlackRock. On the 2nd of December, BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF (IBIT) netted $120 million in Daily Net Inflow, marking a 7% surge. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also drew institutional inflows of $22 million and $7.4 million, respectively. However, ARK Invest’s ARKB bled out about $91 million, bringing the total Daily Net Inflows to $58.5 million. Source: SoSo Value Even so, the performance on the 2nd of December marked the fifth consecutive day of net inflows, which has stabilized the BTC price above $80,000. But do the positive inflows signal the return of the ‘Santa rally’? For his part, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas viewed the IBIT-induced price recovery as the “Vanguard effect.” The world’s second-largest $11 trillion asset manager lifted the crypto ban on the 2nd of December, allowing over 50 million users to trade crypto ETFs, including IBIT. Balchunas said that the IBIT’s renewed inflow was likely driven by Vanguard clients. He added, “Also $1B in IBIT volume in first 30min of trading. I knew those Vanguardians had a little degen in them, even some of the most conservative investors like to add a little hot sauce to their portfolio.” According to him, Vanguard saved BTC from the Q4 plunge. For Coinbase analysts, however, the easing macro front was juicing up liquidity and risk assets. “With quantitative tightening ending, the Fed is back in the bond market, and the drain of cash from markets may be behind us. That’s usually good for risk-on assets like crypto.” The analysts highlighted that the current macro landscape favors ‘breakout trades over knife catching.’ Notably, the extended BTC drop in the past few weeks cleared key supports, including the $98K-$100K which was a significant cluster as a cost basis for most bulls. For Coinbase analysts, this was the next key level to watch. Source: Coinbase/Glassnode Put differently, reclaiming $98K-$100K could attract more demand or cap BTC recovery if most bulls opt to break even and exit positions at the level. Swissblock analytics also echoed the Coinbase outlook. It projected a potential ‘tactical recovery’ from mid-December, citing past liquidity capitulation events that were followed by a strong rebound after 1–3 weeks. Source: Swissblock Despite the optimism, the risk of the Yen carry trade unwinding still appears likely, with an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its meeting set for the 19th of December.

Title: DeFi markets are finally pricing fundamentals — but only after months, new study shows
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/defi-markets-are-finally-pricing-fundamentals-new-study-shows/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T08:44:58Z

About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on December 2. Sign up here. Hey all, Liam here. Decentralised finance has a reputation for pulling projects’ valuations out of thin air, but new research suggests those values aren’t just a fugazi. Greenfield, a Berlin-based venture firm, argues that three key metrics provide far more explanatory power for why valuations move in any direction than any other variable. By closely tracking the fees a protocol generates, its total value locked, and its revenue, Greenfield concludes that investors can typically make better bets on which projects will succeed. What’s more, a model that uses these indicators typically outperforms analytical models that track Bitcoin and Ethereum performance, as well as models that incorporate social sentiment, such as followers on X. This thesis holds at three and six-month horizons. Most importantly, however, it shows that the so-called fundamentals narrative that’s been kicking around X this year is much more than a meme. “The longer you give the market to play out, the more you actually see that there is a divergent performance based on fundamentals versus just everything being correlated to broader market moves,” Felix Machart, a partner at Greenfield and the paper’s co-author, told DL News. It’s not a silver bullet, of course. Investors also need to be aware of temporary spikes in activity related to token incentives, as well as a product’s defensibility amid mounting competition. And fickle social sentiment can create a noisy investing landscape, at least in the short term. Over one month, for example, fundamental measures offer less explanatory power for valuations than the model that tracks the price of Bitcoin and Ether alone, according to Greenfield’s analysis. The analysts also highlight the importance of a token’s volume on decentralised exchanges, active users, daily transactions, and a protocol’s treasury value as additional metrics, albeit with less explanatory power. For those outside of the crypto space, the analysis seems pretty intuitive. A company’s stock will typically rise if it experiences higher revenues quarter after quarter. So, why shouldn’t DeFi protocols? For one, protocols aren’t companies. Their decentralised nature and how they create investor value can differ. Machart says, for instance, that one can consider token buybacks and yield from staking as revenue, since value accrues to token holders regardless. DeFi protocols are also far younger than traditional capital markets. Greenfield’s analysis, spanning 2021 to 2025, isn’t the final word on the matter, either. Far from it. The report ends with additional research questions to expand the data set used, incorporate even more onchain analytics, and extend the timeline for measuring the thesis. Still, the analysis is meaningful — especially as institutional investors begin tiptoeing into the sector. “It just proves that you can invest based on an expectation of future fundamentals playing out,” Machart said. “Market outcomes are not just random and purely hype driven.” “We actually can see trends that show the market is maturing.” Liam Kelly is DL News’ Berlin-based DeFi correspondent.

Title: Meesho IPO: Did SBI Mutual Fund Get Higher Allocation Due to Early Interest?

Time Published: 2025-12-03T07:54:26Z
Full Content:
The anchor book allotment for the highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) of e-commerce platform Meesho ignited controversy after higher anchor allocation to SBI Mutual Fund. Meesho’s IPO advisors prioritised investors who were keen on a long-term partnership with the e-commerce firm, people in the know told NDTV Profit. With this in mind SBI MF secure approximately 25% of the total anchor book portion which was viewed as disproportionately large by other Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). Meesho did not provide an official comment. Meesho, on Tuesday said it has garnered a little over Rs 2,439 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Fidelity Funds, and BlackRock, ahead of its IPO opening for subscription. The anchor book witnessed demand of over Rs 80,000 crore, translating into nearly 30 times oversubscription. The anchor book saw participation from 60 investors, including major domestic institutional investors and leading global names such as the Government of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website. On the domestic front, SBI Mutual Fund (MF), UTI MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Axis MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Bandhan MF, and HSBC MF, among others, have been allotted shares. As per the circular, the company has allocated 21.97 crore equity shares at Rs 111 apiece, raising a total of Rs 2,439.5 crore. The IPO will comprise a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,250 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 10.55 crore shares valued at Rs 1,171 crore at the upper band, taking the total issue size to Rs 5,421 crore. The offer for sale includes the sale of equity shares by some of Meesho's early investors, including Elevation, Peak XV, Venture Highway and Y Combinator, among others. Meesho plans to utilise proceeds for investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand initiatives, as well as funding inorganic growth through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes. The company will make its debut on the stock market on December 10. Overall, 75% of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15% for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10% for retail investors.

Retail investors led the demand with 3.85 times subscription, followed by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) support at 2.12 times and non-institutional investors (NIIs) at 1.80 times. Meesho on Tuesday raised ₹2,439.54 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Tiger Global, ADIA, GIC, BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, WCM investment, Goldman Sachs and Dragoneer. The e-commerce firm aims to raise ₹5,421 crore through the IPO, which concludes on December 5. It has fixed a price band of ₹105-111 per share, valuing the company at ₹50,096 crore ($5.6 billion) at the upper end. The IPO comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹4,250 crore, and an OFS of 10.55 crore shares valued at ₹1,171 crore at the upper band. The company will use the proceeds for investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand initiatives, as well as funding inorganic growth through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes. Meesho IPO: Key things to know and should you subscribe? Most analysts acknowledged the company’s strong position in the value-e-commerce segment, deep penetration in Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets, and its asset-light marketplace model, which has helped it scale rapidly. They noted that Meesho’s improving unit economics and declining losses make it a promising long-term growth story. However, several brokerages also highlight risks such as intense competition, the company’s still-evolving path to profitability, and the need to sustain growth without heavy discounting. Brokerages have largely issued a “subscribe for long term” stance rather than an aggressive “subscribe” for listing gains. Overall, brokerages see potential but recommend that investors approach the issue with realistic expectations and a long-term horizon. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires, also witnessed healthy first-day subscription, largely fueled by retail buyers. The Aequs IPO drew 3.42 times subscription on its opening day, driven largely by strong retail interest at 11.46 times. Non-institutional investors subscribed 3.40 times, while QIB participation remained modest at 0.66 times. The employee quota was subscribed 6.72 times. The contract manufacturing firm Aequs launched its ₹922-crore IPO at a price of ₹118-124. It comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors. Ahead of the IPO, it collected ₹414 crore from anchor investors. Vidya Wires’ IPO recorded 2.89 times overall subscription, with strong interest from retail investors at 4.02 times and NIIs at 3.42 times, while QIB participation remained subdued at 0.47 times. The ₹300-crore IPO of Vidya Wires comprised of fresh issue of shares worth ₹274 crore and OFS of 50.01 lakh shares valued at ₹26 crore, at a price band of ₹48-52 per share. The company raised ₹90 crore from anchor investors. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Thames Water debt pile rises further despite return to profit

The UK's largest supplier reveals a surge in complaints about rising bills but says its performance, such as in preventing sewage spills, has improved. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 December 2025 07:33, UK Cash-strapped Thames Water has revealed a further rise in its debt pile while recording a return to profit on the back of inflation-busting hikes to bills. The UK's largest supplier said the 31% rise to customer bills since April had allowed it to increase capital investment by 22% to £1.3bn amid demands it improve performance in preventing sewage spills and stopping leaks. Thames Water said it recorded a 20% drop in pollution incidents over the six months to the end of September, and leakage performance was holding steady despite the "extremely dry summer". Money latest: How much is a fair restaurant tip? While waste complaints dipped by 11%, according to the company, there was a 42% surge in the number of customers complaining about the hike to bills. Thames Water revenue rose 42% on the same period last year to £1.9bn, helping a return to profit after tax of £328m on the back of a £190m loss during April-September 2024. Oil prices are down - so why isn't the cost of fuel? Revealed: The 10 happiest places to live in the UK | Money blog Child poverty strategy unveiled - but not everyone's happy The company said profitability was damaged by higher debt serving costs. Its debt pile was recorded at £17.6bn - a rise of 5%. The results were released against the backdrop of continuing talks involving the government and regulators over a proposed rescue deal by major Thames Water creditors. Their consortium is known as London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but regulator Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of industry oversight, has been leading scrutiny of London & Valley's operational plan and proposed capital structure. The prospective deal would write off billions of pounds of the company's debt and inject billions in fresh equity, in return for an adjustment in the regulator's approach to future financial penalties. Thames sees the creditors' proposal as the only viable solution. Despite huge hikes to household bills - allowed across England and Wales to bolster aging infrastructure including storm overflows - the company says its financial turnaround has been hampered by record fines for things like sewage leaks and bonuses to retain key staff. Sky News revealed on Tuesday that its remuneration committee will meet next week to decide whether to proceed with nearly £2.5m in retention payments to 21 senior managers.

"This progress has all been achieved as we also manage the recapitalisation of the business. We continue to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led solution that we believe is in the best interests of our customers and the environment. "This in turn will allow the transformation of Thames to continue, a programme that will take at least a decade to complete and will restore the infrastructure and operations of the company."

Title: BlackRock’s top brass says tokenization will bridge crypto and finance

BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management, and operates the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. Former crypto skeptic BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein say tokenization will act as a bridge between the crypto industry and traditional finance, doubling down on their support of the sector. In an opinion article penned by Fink and Goldstein and published Monday in The Economist, the pair said that tokenization won’t replace the existing financial system any time soon, but predict it will help merge the two industries. “Think of it instead as a bridge being built from both sides of a river, converging in the middle. On one side stand traditional institutions. On the other are digital-first innovators: stablecoin issuers, fintech’s and public blockchains,” the pair wrote. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Its co-founder and CEO, Fink, was previously a crypto skeptic before he changed his mind. Fink and Goldstein said at first glance, it was hard for them to see the “big idea” because tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which “often looked like speculation.” “But in recent years, traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today,” they added. BlackRock already has the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, launched in March 2024. However, Fink and Goldstein also stated that tokenization must proceed safely, with appropriate regulations, which requires policymakers and regulators to update the rules to enable traditional and tokenized markets to work together. Related: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) followed a similar path for fixed income, connecting dealer markets with public exchanges, allowing investors to trade more efficiently, according to Fink and Goldstein. “And now with spot Bitcoin ETFs, even digital assets are on traditional exchanges. Each of these innovations builds bridges. The same principle applies to tokenization,” they said.

Title: Criteo CEO Michael Komasinski on agentic commerce, experiments with LLMs, and M&A rumors

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 5. In early 2025, Criteo entered a new chapter, with its current CEO, Michael Komasinski, taking the reins as the fourth chief executive of the company in its 20-year history — a sign that investors expect bold strategic recalibration for the Nasdaq-listed outfit. That transition comes amid a turbulent backdrop: over the last several years, its share price and market cap have fluctuated amid speculation over “signal-loss,” albeit Google’s U-turn on its earlier plans for Chrome augured well in Komasinski’s time in office, not to mention the disruptive emergence of AI. In response, Criteo has attempted to rebrand itself from a heavy-hitting retargeting outfit to a commerce media platform that’s now experimenting with LLMs, publishers, and retailers alike to hone monetization in the AI-first era. Komasinski sat down with Digiday to discuss these efforts on the sidelines of a recent press event, explaining his strategy as he approaches his one-year anniversary in office. The conversation below has been edited for brevity and clarity. I think there are two tracks in terms of how it changes things. The first is the self-service… we will launch Commerce Go as a self-service tool by the end of Q1 next year. That means an advertiser can go online, put in their credit card information, and have campaigns up and running in 10 minutes. It is competitive with some of the self-service tools from Meta with Advantage+ or from Google with Performance Max –the differentiation versus those platforms is that it’s cross-channel. Criteo has always had a healthy amount of managed service that was required to drive the platform, and I see that changing quite a bit over the next couple of years. The second track around agentic with retail, that really is an extension of what we do today — the ability to power sponsored ads or improved relevancy for a retailer — that’s just an extension of capabilities that we serve on product detail pages currently. Nothing to disclose on revenue models or forecasts yet, but it is exciting. One of the reasons it is exciting is that it leverages existing infrastructure, so we don’t have to reinvent the way crawling monetization is resolved. It’s using the RTB pipes that the BidSwitch is built on, and for mid-to-longtail publishers, which is a segment that’s like really underserved in the LLM free-for-all that’s going on. So, we’re encouraged by the pilot with RTB, and looking to find other publishing partners to do further testing with, then we’ll start to refine that monetization model, and hopefully that will turn out to be a viable product for mid-to-longtail publishers and us. When you’re a publicly traded company, right, you are always looking for ways to maximize value for shareholders. But no, we’re not in a process of any kind today; the redomiciling of the parent-level entity is really designed to improve our ability to attract passive capital to our shares and to improve trading liquidity. It doesn’t really change the operations of the business. Our tech team is still based in Paris, as are many of our back office functions, and we don’t see any changes to that. So it should help the stock become more easily included in passive indices like ETFs, which should be good for our shareholders. I don’t have anything firm to say on that, other than, again, as a publicly traded company, you always have a responsibility to look at your portfolio of assets and to make sure that everything’s a good fit for the strategy that you’re pursuing. As we continue to make progress with the whole set, commerce media is the north star, and all of the different segments are laddering up to that pretty well, but it is a responsible thing to always be looking at your portfolio. We are excited about it, but I think the reason we don’t talk more about it is that the test isn’t complete yet. There’s testing that’s happening over the course of this month, so we don’t want to get ahead of that, although I’m pretty confident that the test results will be positive. When you’re dealing with a third party that you’re dependent on, it’s not about what you think; it’s about what they want to do, but I think the results show an uplift in relevancy. It’s up to them as to what they want to do with that. Is that something they want to pay for, or is that something that shapes how they think about native ad units powered by intelligence?

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Boeing Climbs on Positive Outlook; Intel Extends Rally

Shares of an aircraft manufacturer skyrocketed as a top executive said deliveries and free cash flow would trend higher in 2026, while a large semiconductor player extended its hot streak. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Tuesday, recovering from a sell-off in the prior session. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3%, the Dow added 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.6%. In another bright sign for risk assets, the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) clawed back some of its recent losses. See here for Investopedia's full coverage of today's top market stories. Boeing (BA) shares soared 10.2%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave provided an optimistic outlook for the aircraft manufacturer heading into 2026. Speaking at an industry conference, the executive touted Boeing's progress on its recovery plans and said the company expects to increase deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year. The plane maker also anticipates strong free cash flow growth in 2026. Intel (INTC) shares jumped 8.7%, adding to gains posted late last week amid speculation that Apple (AAPL) could be poised to become a new Intel customer. A potential deal with the iPhone maker would come on top of a string of high-profile agreements for Intel this year, including a partnership with AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). Stifel upgraded Teradyne (TER) stock to "buy" from "hold," and shares of the technology testing solutions provider gained 5.7%. Analysts pointed to a shift in Teradyne's focus toward high-growth markets, with AI applications expected to account for a more substantial portion of the firm's semiconductor test revenue as the business expands beyond its traditional smartphone and consumer markets. Companies in the paper and packaging business came under pressure Tuesday. The industry has faced concerns about sluggish consumer spending, elevated costs, and excess supply. Packaging Corporation of America (PKG) shares sank 5.3%. In its most recent earnings report released in October, Packaging Corp. posted lower-than-expected profit. Shares of competitors International Paper (IP) and Smurfit WestRock (SW) each fell 3.4% on Tuesday. AutoZone (AZO) shares slipped 3.1% following cautious commentary about the auto parts retailer from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment bank noted that AutoZone could face cost headwinds related to tariffs and increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses, although analysts still believe the company is positioned to benefit from positive industry trends.

Title: Trump DOJ Sides With Roundup Manufacturer Over Cancer Victims in Supreme Court Case

Bottles of Roundup weed and grass killer are stacked at a Costco Wholesale store on March 11, 2025, in San Diego, California. An attorney at Food & Water Watch said the DOJ sent a "clear message... to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides: Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs." The Trump administration is pushing for the US Supreme Court to shield the manufacturer of Roundup from thousands of state lawsuits alleging that its widely used herbicide product causes cancer. On Monday, US Solicitor General D. John Sauer recommended that the high court agree to hear a challenge to a Missouri jury's verdict in 2023 that awarded $1.25 million to a man named John Durnell, who claimed that the product caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Bayer, the agribusiness giant that purchased the manufacturer of Roundup, the agribusiness giant Monsanto, in 2018, immediately challenged the verdict. In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence." That evidence became less limited in 2019, when a prominent meta-analysis by a team of environmental health researchers found that people exposed to glyphosate at the highest levels had a 41% higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma than those who weren't. There are nearly 4,500 Roundup claims currently pending in federal court, and at least 24 cases have gone to trial since October 2023. They make up just a fraction of the more than 170,000 claims filed. According to Bloomberg, Bayer has already been forced to pay out more than $10 billion in verdicts and settlements over the product, which has caused a massive drain on the company's stock price. In what it said was an effort to “manage litigation risk and not because of any safety concerns,” Bayer removed glyphosate-based herbicides from the residential market in 2023, switching to formulas that “rely on alternative active ingredients.” That didn't stop the lawsuits from coming. Durnell's victory was the first successful case brought against Bayer outside California, the only state that labels the product as carcinogenic. That in Missouri opened the floodgates in other states, and plaintiffs subsequently won sizable payouts in Georgia and Pennsylvania. But now the Trump administration is trying to help the company skirt further accountability. Sauer, who is tasked with arguing for the government in nearly every Supreme Court case, filed a 24-page brief stating that there is a lack of clarity on whether states have the authority to determine whether Bayer and Monsanto violated the law by failing to warn customers about potential cancer risks from Roundup. Bayer argues that these cases are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which forbids states from enacting labeling requirements more stringent than those recommended by the federal government. Sauer agreed with Bayer, stating in the brief that the US Environmental Protection Agency "has repeatedly determined that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic in humans, and the agency has repeatedly approved Roundup labels that did not contain cancer warnings." In 2016 and again in 2020, the EPA indeed classified glyphosate as "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" following agency assessments. However, in 2022, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals voided this assessment, finding that the agency applied “inconsistent reasoning” in its review of the science. Among the justifications for the ruling were that the EPA relied heavily on unpublished, non-peer-reviewed studies submitted to regulators by Monsanto and other companies that manufacture glyphosate. The agency also largely disregarded findings from animal studies included by the IARC, which showed a strong link between glyphosate and cancer. "The World Health Organization has recognized glyphosate as a probable carcinogen while the EPA continues to twist itself into pretzels to come to the opposite conclusion," Lori Ann Burd, a staff attorney and director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program, told Common Dreams. Notably, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built his national profile campaigning against the dangers of pesticides and railing against regulatory capture by big business. Kennedy served as an attorney for Dewayne Johnson, the first plaintiff to win damages against Monsanto in 2018, where a jury determined that Roundup had contributed to his cancer. "If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luthor," Kennedy said in a 2020 Facebook post. "I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value." During Kennedy's 2024 presidential run, he pledged to "ban the worst agricultural chemicals already banned in other countries." But after he was sworn in as President Donald Trump's HHS Secretary, he began to sing a different tune. As Investigate Midwest noted, his "Make America Healthy Again" commission's introductory report made no mention of glyphosate. Meanwhile, he reassured the pesticide industry that it had nothing to worry about: "There’s a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model," he said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. The Trump EPA has deregulated toxic chemicals across the board over the past year. It rolled back protections against per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," in drinking water, which have many documented health risks. It has also declined to ban the widely used insecticide chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Elizabeth Kucinich, the former director of policy at the Center for Food Safety, described the US Department of Justice's effort to shield Bayer as another "betrayal of MAHA health promises." Her husband, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, worked as the campaign manager for RFK Jr.'s 2024 presidential bid. “This is regulatory capture, not public protection,” she said. “This action shields chemical manufacturers from accountability by elevating a captured federal regulatory process over the lived harm of real people. That is anti-life, and it is exactly what millions of MAHA voters believed they were voting against.” Food & Water Watch staff attorney Dani Replogle said the DOJ filing "encourages the Supreme Court to slam judiciary doors in the faces of cancer patients across the country." "No political posturing can undo the clear message this brief sends to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides," she continued. "Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs."

The agency also largely disregarded findings from animal studies included by the IARC, which showed a strong link between glyphosate and cancer. "The World Health Organization has recognized glyphosate as a probable carcinogen while the EPA continues to twist itself into pretzels to come to the opposite conclusion," Lori Ann Burd, a staff attorney and director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program, told Common Dreams. Notably, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built his national profile campaigning against the dangers of pesticides and railing against regulatory capture by big business. Kennedy served as an attorney for Dewayne Johnson, the first plaintiff to win damages against Monsanto in 2018, where a jury determined that Roundup had contributed to his cancer. "If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luthor," Kennedy said in a 2020 Facebook post. "I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value." During Kennedy's 2024 presidential run, he pledged to "ban the worst agricultural chemicals already banned in other countries." But after he was sworn in as President Donald Trump's HHS Secretary, he began to sing a different tune. As Investigate Midwest noted, his "Make America Healthy Again" commission's introductory report made no mention of glyphosate. Meanwhile, he reassured the pesticide industry that it had nothing to worry about: "There’s a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model," he said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. The Trump EPA has deregulated toxic chemicals across the board over the past year. It rolled back protections against per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," in drinking water, which have many documented health risks. It has also declined to ban the widely used insecticide chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Elizabeth Kucinich, the former director of policy at the Center for Food Safety, described the US Department of Justice's effort to shield Bayer as another "betrayal of MAHA health promises." Her husband, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, worked as the campaign manager for RFK Jr.'s 2024 presidential bid. “This is regulatory capture, not public protection,” she said. “This action shields chemical manufacturers from accountability by elevating a captured federal regulatory process over the lived harm of real people. That is anti-life, and it is exactly what millions of MAHA voters believed they were voting against.” Food & Water Watch staff attorney Dani Replogle said the DOJ filing "encourages the Supreme Court to slam judiciary doors in the faces of cancer patients across the country." "No political posturing can undo the clear message this brief sends to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides," she continued. "Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs."

Title: Betrayed American workers expose dark underbelly of H-1B visa scheme

By Jason Hopkins, Daily Caller News Foundation December 2, 2025 They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,’” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

When will AMD ship their GPU that can compete in all metrics with those NVIDIA GPUs? When that occurs we will see some major shifting of market caps! After all, it’s not magic, it’s engineering. iPhone sales matter more than anything to Wall Street. Certainly, actual product sales should matter more than some potential A.I. nonsense. I’m glad Wall Street is somewhat coming to its senses. It irks me that so much emphasis is put on A.I. despite only a few hardware companies are profiting from it. There are so many data centers being built, and yet the demand for A.I. doesn’t really exist for most consumers. Is there even enough energy to go around to power all those data centers, especially when the summer heat arrives? Your email address will not be published.

Share this article Investor Michael Burry, best known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, criticized Bitcoin on a podcast, comparing it to the historical tulip bubble and expressing skepticism about its valuation and utility. “It’s not worth anything. Everybody’s accepted it. It’s the tulip bulb of our time,” Burry said. “It’s worse than a tulip bulb, because this has enabled so much criminal activity to go deep under.” The hedge fund manager, who has recently made headlines for placing bearish bets against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), called the fact that Bitcoin reached $100,000 is “the most ridiculous thing.” “That same people are sitting on TV talking about Bitcoin. They’re just casually, it’s $100,000, it’s down, now it’s $98,000,” he said. Despite dropping below $84,000 on Monday, Bitcoin reclaimed $90,000 after the US market opening. The digital asset was trading at around $90,600 at press time, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. It’s not the first time Michael Burry has criticized Bitcoin. In early 2021, he called it a “speculative bubble” comparable to the dot-com and housing bubbles, despite its growing relevance and popularity. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value since then.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/02/2025 8:23:31 AM PST by DFG They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April.

The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home.

Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Title: Why Morgan Stanley just got more bullish on Nvidia stock, even as it struggles

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia has been under pressure in recent weeks amid a rethink of the AI trade, but one top bank says investors don't have much of a reason to worry about the chip king. Nvidia stock is down 9% over the last month. Even its blockbuster third-quarter earnings failed to generate new excitement for the company and the broader AI sector. Big-name investors like Peter Thiel and SoftBank have dumped the stock, adding pressure. But Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore this week pushed back on the downbeat narratives, increasing the bank's price target for the stock to $250 from $235 on Monday. The new target is among the highest on Wall Street, and implies a nearly 40% jump from current levels. Moore said that he thinks threats to the AI leader's market share, specifically those in Asian markets, are overstated. Speculation that Nvidia's dominance in the AI market may be threatened isn't new. Ever since the AI leader shot to the top of the tech sector following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have wondered how long it can maintain the rank as the top AI hardware maker. Morgan Stanley doesn't see any other chipmakers as posing a significant threat to Nvidia, though, even as China prioritizes building out its own domestic semiconductor supply chain. The analysts recently visited Asia and shared their take on why Nvidia shouldn't be worried about competition from the east. "While there is much attention being paid to Chinese AI solutions, we think that they are very limited on multiple levels, including cluster size and scale out technologies, and China software still would like access to western solutions," the analysts stated in a note on Monday. Moore also said his team reconciled the ambitious $500 billion estimate for chip revenue given by CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's GTC event in October. "Having met with several contacts in both Asia and in the US, we are comfortable increasing estimates to get revenues to that level." While the analysts increased their price targets for both Nvidia and fellow chipmaker Broadcom, they said they still see Nvidia as the sector's clear winner. "We model for AVGO and AMD to grow their AI processor revenues slightly faster than NVDA in CY26, but that mostly just reflects supply chain limitations of a $205 bn run rate revenue stream - all key products are supply constrained through 2026," the note stated. The analysts are convinced that even as competition in the AI chip market intensifies, Nvidia will still maintain the best performance-to-cost ratio and be able to access a wider range of AI applications and workloads than its competitors.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme

They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” (RELATED: Major Democrat Donor Has Sizeable Stake In Pot Company Raided By ICE) “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY – AUGUST 08: An employee works in a 3-D scan lab at GE Appliances on August 08, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images for GE Appliances, a Haier company) Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 19: President Donald Trump holds up an executive order establishing the “Trump Gold Card” in the Oval Office at the White House on September 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Title: Warner Bros.’ Bidding War Escalates: Here Are the Challenges Facing Comcast, Netflix and Paramount | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-12-02T14:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The three companies are in hot pursuit for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery, but they each have their own regulatory and political hurdles As Warner Bros. Discovery’s board mulls over a second round of bids from Paramount, Comcast and Netflix, a factor it’ll have to consider is just how easily a deal will get approved by regulators. That was the crux of a lot of the chatter that emerged in the days leading up to the Monday deadline, which saw the three companies submitting new, binding offers for all or parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to various press reports. Netflix showing strong interest in WBD’s assets, including making a mostly cash offer to acquire them, coincided with reports that the White House had antitrust concerns, while Comcast, which also submitted a bid, still has to deal with the challenge that President Donald Trump loathes CEO Brian Roberts. Paramount also reportedly sweetened its bid with a reported all-cash offer financed by asset management firm Apollo Group and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and is selling itself as the easiest path to getting its deal done thanks to CEO David Ellison and his father’s cushy relationship with Trump. The new round of bids and the chatter signals how the stakes have gone up in the race for WBD. The winner would gain valuable streaming, IP and studio assets and, in the case of Paramount, also expand its cable TV footprint. Any of the three scenarios will lead to a massive reshaping of the entertainment industry and a further consolidation of power in Hollywood. TheWrap previously reported that a final decision is expected to be made around Christmas. Netflix and Paramount declined to comment, although a Paramount representative did not respond to a later request for a comment on the prospect of the sovereign wealth funds participating, which TheWrap previously reported on. Representatives for Warner Bros. and Comcast did not immediately return a request for comment. Until then, here’s a rundown of where each bidder stands and some of the regulatory challenges they each face. Out of all the players, Paramount Skydance would have the easiest time acquiring WBD, mostly because it has already played this game. The company is fresh off Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, which cleared in August. Since it already secured FCC approval from the Trump administration before, several experts, including LightShed Partners partner and technology analyst Rich Greenfield, have noted that the previous acquisition puts Paramount on the regulatory “fast track.” Another thing working in Paramount’s favor is its interest in the company overall as well as its deep pockets. Out of the three companies interested in bidding on Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount is the only one that wants the full company and not just the Warner Bros. studio and streaming division. Yep, it wants cable too. Paramount noted it would increase the amount paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80%, bumping up the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. It’s also clear that Paramount really really wants this. Whereas Comcast and Netflix only submitted one previous bid, this marks Paramount Skydance’s fourth bid. The first three were rejected for being too low. Additionally, Zaslav may be personally interested in selling to Paramount. CEO Ellison offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title as part of his Warner offer. So what’s working against Paramount? Concerns over the theatrical division will be a hurdle, since Paramount acquiring WBD will drop the number of major film studios from five to four. But perhaps the main obstacle to clear is one that can’t be measured by hard financial figures. It’s only been four months since Ellison took control of Paramount. So far, the only things to come out of that acquisition have been a lot of layoffs and departures (bye, over 1,000 employees and gone-in-2028 Taylor Sheridan) as well as several headline grabbing deals (“South Park” and UFC’s deals are in the billions). Simply put, it’s way too early to know if the Ellison era is a good — and lucrative — era of the company. Despite the creative-friendly reputation Ellison has in the industry, that’s sure to be a concern. At first glance, Comcast taking over Warner Bros. makes the most sense. Both companies house legacy Hollywood institutions — NBCUniversal and Warner Bros., respectively. Thanks to its movie studio arm, Comcast understands the challenges of theatrical, and because of Peacock, it understands the headaches around streaming. Comcast is also reportedly the preferred option for WBD head Zaslav. Two struggling giants teaming up to combat this difficult landscape is a matchup that works, like Godzilla and King Kong teaming up to take down the Skar King (IP, folks!). The problems come down to money, possible theatrical overreach and Trump. It’s widely believed that Comcast’s pockets aren’t as deep as the Ellison family’s Oracle-powered fortune. That being said, according to the New York Post, Comcast CEO Roberts was considering a potential offer that could reach as high as $28 a share for just the studio and streaming business. As for the theatrical side of the business, Comcast will face the same questions as Paramount. At the moment, there are only five major movie studios: Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. Two of them being owned by the same company will raise some regulatory eyebrows no matter which companies are involved. Other than cash, it’s the Trump administration that may also pose a major threat to Comcast scooping up Warner Bros. The president has been outspoken about his dislike of Roberts, calling the CEO “a disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting” on Truth Social. Though NBCUniversal will be spinning its cable assets off into Versant sometime early next year, Comcast’s ownership of MSNBC (now MS NOW) could rub Trump the wrong way. Comcast also owns NBC, which is home to Seth Meyers’ “Late Night,” which last month drew Trump’s ire as he called for the host to be fired. As the “60 Minutes” lawsuit ahead of Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount demonstrated, Trump isn’t above dangling FCC approval to make major media networks act the way he wants. Like Comcast, Netflix only wants Warner Bros., which encompasses Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio divisions. Let’s start with the positives. Warner Bros. Discovery has warmed up to Netflix’s potential bid, Gasparino reported. Netflix has always had a healthy respect for Warner. Way back in 2012, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos famously said, “We’re going to become HBO before HBO could become us.” Acquiring the company behind HBO — especially during a time when Netflix is interested in “selective” merger and acquisition deals — would be a big step in that direction. Netflix also has deep pockets and has proven it’s willing to overspend to get what it wants. But that’s about where the pro-Netflix argument ends. Because Netflix is notoriously against showing movies in theaters, its interest in acquiring one of the five big movie studios has ruffled the feathers of many in the industry, especially since theater attendance is down nearly 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros., it’s hard to say whether it would abandon its current strategy and lean into theaters or if it would continue to make its movies streaming-first. And if Netflix did lean into theaters, that leads to a whole other set of issues. Netflix would have to learn the international theatrical ropes in a very short amount of time. But the biggest argument against Netflix is that it’s simply too big. Netflix is consistently the top premium streamer when it comes to Nielsen’s monthly The Gauge reports. If it were to acquire HBO Max as well, the ensuing streamer would be an even bigger behemoth in a landscape where it dominates. Government officials are already thinking about antitrust concerns if there is a Netflix acquisition. That potential investigation has been compared to the lengthy antitrust investigations Google and Amazon underwent and that Netflix has avoided so far. Overcoming those regulatory hurdles from the Department of Justice would likely take more than two years before it even goes to court, according to the New York Post. It’s unclear if Netflix or Warner Bros. would want to undergo this joint headache. Ironically, what could save Netflix is YouTube. If the case can be made that YouTube, which consistently leads the Nielsen charts, is the actual entertainment leader, Netflix may be able to acquire Warner Bros. without antitrust concerns. It just comes down to how well YouTube’s user-generated content can be separated from Netflix’s premium content.

UPDATED 07:00 EST / DECEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley Audio artificial intelligence startup Gradium is launching today after closing on an impressive $70 million seed funding round, just three months after it was founded. The startup is backed by investors that include FirstMark Capital and Eurazeo, which led the funding round, as well as DST Global Partners, Korelya Capital and Amplify Partners, and high-profile angels such as former Google LLC Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. Gradium’s mission is to commercialize audio language models, which are specialized AI systems that are designed to process, understand and generate natural language using audio-text data. Natural language is leveraged as a “supervision signal,” allowing ALMs to perform tasks such as audio classification and speech synthesis more effectively than general-purpose large language models. The startup says ALMs are the “audio-native counterpart” to LLMs and are meant to support more natural and expressive voice interactions with dramatically lower latency, making conversations with AI feel more realistic. The concept was first developed by Gradium’s founders during their time at Kyutai, a nonprofit AI research lab. ALMs are trained on datasets that pair audio with descriptive text, enabling them to learn the complex relationships between sound and language. The natural language supervision technique replaces traditional labeling, using natural speech as a guiding signal to teach them how to understand and say specific words. Co-founder and Chief Executive Neil Zeghidour explained that his company wants to help ALMs lock the true potential of “voice AI,” which is still reliant on what he says are subpar systems. “Existing systems are brittle, costly and unable to deliver truly natural interactions,” he said. “Our goal is to make voice the primary interface between humans and machines.” According to Zeghidour, ALMs can outperform LLMs in any kind of voice AI task, including areas such as speech recognition, where spoken language is transformed into written text, as well as audio generation, such as creating original speech, and audio classification, which refers to identifying and categorizing different audio signals. Ultimately, Gradium wants to transform the capabilities of AI assistants and agents, making conversational interactions between them and humans feel more natural and realistic. “To achieve this, we’re eliminating the longstanding tradeoff between quality and scalability: combining ultra-realistic expressivity, accurate transcription and ultra-low-latency interactions at a price point that finally makes high-quality voice ubiquitous,” Zeghidour said. Zeghidour has assembled a talented team to make good on this promise, comprised of researchers and engineers who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, Meta Platforms Inc.’s FAIR research team and Jane Street Capital LLC. He said the company possesses one of the industry’s highest concentrations of generative audio expertise assembled so far, and it has already developed a number of production-ready systems that are being used by early adopters and generating revenue. Those early adopters include companies in gaming, customer care, language learning, healthcare and AI agents. Gradium is launching its platform and enabling access to its first models today, with support for English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. It says it offers flexible plans catering to the smallest developer teams all the way up to the largest enterprises. The startup said it will continue its ongoing collaboration with Kyutai, ensuring it has access to the latest frontier research in generative audio so it can remain at the forefront of the latest innovations in ALMs. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Prices in the Machine

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Earlier this year, a slightly balding man in spectacles, a black T-shirt, and bright high-top sneakers gave a presentation about how his computer can predict what you want to buy. His name is Dr. Uri Yerushalmi, co-founder and chief artificial intelligence officer of Fetcherr, an Israeli-based pricing consultant used by a half dozen airlines around the world. “While most of us in the AI community have been focusing on building models that are generating either text or image, in Fetcherr we have been focusing during the last five years on building large market models,” Yerushalmi said. Trained on years of market data—prices, orders, competitors, regulation, stock prices, even the weather—Fetcherr’s “business agents” aim to simulate market dynamics, assist pricing analysts, and even automatically price tickets. More from David Dayen One presentation slide stuck out. It showed price fluctuations before the use of Fetcherr’s system and after. In the before graph, prices are relatively static and straight. After Fetcherr, the jagged lines pulse with staccato rhythms. “The dynamic is much more similar to dynamics in NASDAQ or capital markets where the prices change much more frequently,” said Yerushalmi, “because every time something in the market changes, there is an immediate response.” Yerushalmi once ran AI for a high-speed stock trading firm. He approaches pricing like a science experiment, engaging in constant real-time testing and tweaking to maximize corporate profits. Fetcherr boasts of delivering annual “revenue uplift” of over 10 percent. The guinea pigs for these tests, the ones being separated from their cash, are you and me. AI can depict you as an anime character. It can respond half-intelligently to questions about the Franco-Prussian War or concentrations of sulfur in the upper atmosphere. It can delight and distract and maybe help you get work done. But none of that is as prized by corporate America as its data-driven approach to the previously conjectural world of pricing. Supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. “That’s the use case they don’t want you to talk about. That’s why we’re building all these data centers,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. “As we have built social media platforms that shape the flow of information across society, now we are building the platforms that control the flow of money.” Technology-fueled pricing is more widespread than once thought, presenting serious policy challenges in an age where affordability is on everyone’s minds. AI bots are colluding with one another, anticipating consumer choices, and accumulating surplus—that is, transferring wealth—for the businesses that employ them. It’s part of why corporate profits hit record highs after the pandemic and have stayed there. The public recoils at the thought of seeing prices tick up based on when they like to get lunch or what device they’re using. When Delta, which employs Fetcherr as a pricing agent, announced on an earnings call this summer that up to 20 percent of its flights would be priced using AI by the end of the year, the outcry was so intense that the company claimed its critics were peddling “misinformation.” Policymakers and advocates have united to crack down on some tactics, winning real legislative victories from coast to coast. But every step government takes can be countered by AI price-setters. How can consumers keep up? “What worries me is that it will become hyperefficient to price discriminate and to charge more in ways that ordinary people will not be able to combat,” said Doha Mekki, the top deputy at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division under Joe Biden. “And it will make a very bad cost-of-living crisis even worse.” A YEAR AGO, I WROTE ABOUT WHAT I TERMED surveillance pricing: companies offering individualized prices based on personal data. The idea was that a business equipped with granular information about demographics, purchase history, social and financial interactions, or even medical status could exploit a customer’s willingness to pay. Uber could charge more when a rider booked on a company credit card; people aren’t as price-sensitive when someone else is paying. Delta could jack up fares after learning that a traveler needs to attend a funeral; desperation could translate into opportunity. I couldn’t be certain how many businesses used surveillance pricing. The proliferation of third-party pricing consultants touting “digital pricing transformations” seemed like a strong indicator. But concealment was key to the strategy, to minimize the anger generated by charging different prices to different people. For instance, when a reporter at SFGate logged in to hotel booking platforms using his regular IP address in high-wage San Francisco, he received a quote of $829 a night. But when he used a virtual private network set up to originate from Phoenix or Kansas City, prices were more than $500 less. Without a public price, it takes research to understand if someone is being ripped off. A month after my report, Lina Khan’s Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into surveillance pricing, seeking information from eight third-party consultants. The agency only had a short time to conduct the study before the changeover of power in Washington. But days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it issued “research summaries” of the work done thus far. (Trump’s FTC has yet to finish the study.) Stephanie Nguyen, the FTC’s chief technologist under Khan, told me those eight pricing consultants were working with over 250 clients, suggesting broad reach across the economy. Services included individually targeted pricing, segmentation of customers based on their profiles, and ranking tools that alter what products people see atop a web page or search. A customer clicking on fast shipping, for example, suggests an urgency that would lead them to tolerate higher prices. The key to surveillance pricing is data. Nguyen and Sam Levine, the FTC’s former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, recently wrote a paper about how customers deliver that data when they sign up for loyalty programs. Enticed by promised discounts and concierge treatment, customers consent to data collection that allows companies to build intricate social graphs; one customer profile created by the grocery chain Kroger stretched to 62 pages. The discounts often aren’t maintained or are curtailed, loyalty card fees expand over time, and the more loyal a customer, the more data is collected and the more they pay over time, according to the report. One case study is the McDonald’s app, which has 185 million users and provides seamless access on smartphones, our personal data-spewing machines. According to a recent earnings call, after downloading the app, a customer goes from 10.5 annual McDonald’s visits on average to 26. McDonald’s clearly wants its customers on the app. Its popular Monopoly game gives out stickers on the packaging of items like Big Macs and fries; you collect the right ones to win big prizes. But this year, instead of filling out a physical game board, Monopoly pieces now must be scanned into the app. “This is about taxing people who don’t turn over their data, and manipulating people who do,” Levine said. “Do we really want a world in which you will have to pay a premium if you want to shop anonymously?” Surveillance pricing is just one technology that companies use to set prices. Surge pricing accelerates supply and demand to raise prices when more people want the product or service. Subscription pricing offers products for a monthly fee, a steady stream of revenue from absent-minded customers that can feature deceptive sign-ups and impossible cancellation policies. Trump’s FTC sued Uber for a subscription service that takes as many as 23 screens and 32 actions to cancel; Amazon Prime’s cancellation policy, the subject of a separate FTC settlement that cost the company $2.5 billion, was internally nicknamed “Iliad Flow,” like the tortuous war Odysseus waged in the Greek epic. Electronic shelf tags at Walmart and other grocers have triggered fears of endlessly changing prices while you shop. FIFA has confirmed use of differential pricing for World Cup events based on demand, something New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has criticized. “They can become a tool for pure extraction and leave everybody paying what they shouldn’t,” said Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, which monitors event ticketing. One of the most insidious uses of technology is on the wage side. An issue brief from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth focused on how companies are using personal data to set worker pay, something first seen in the ride-hailing industry. Twenty AI consultants offer surveillance wage services to clients in logistics, manufacturing, retail, finance, education, transportation, technology, and health care, which is “the new Uber in a lot of ways,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California and co-author of the report. The AI systems can adjust worker pay in real time, and offer different wages to people doing the same work. They can adjust wages based on performance data, customer feedback, and even factors off the job, such as “predictive analytics that attempt to determine a worker’s potential tolerance for low pay,” the report notes. Most of these wage-setting practices are opaque to workers or their bargaining representatives. “This is becoming normalized,” Dubal said. “It fundamentally undermines the well-worn and very American idea that hard work should result in higher pay.” The result of these strategies is that supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. AI-based pricing has become more critical than sale volume or product quality. Customers seeking a fair deal are simply outworked, unable to avoid being targeted. “There used to be moments where you really blew it, you had to buy a last-minute airline ticket and they’ve got you,” said Tim Wu, former competition policy chief in the Biden White House. “That’s really daily life now.” Consumers used to benefit from what economists would call imperfect information. The uncertainty of defining the optimal price, and the ability in open markets for new businesses to undercut competitors, gave consumers a fighting chance to get a deal, or just to manage their life without being tracked and prodded. Technology eliminates that information inefficiency. “What these technologies are about is eliminating all risk for the shareholder,” Hepner said. “There’s no more error. It is a well-oiled extraction machine.” EVEN ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED by the furiousness of the response to technology-aided pricing. As post-pandemic inflation swelled, AI trickery was a tangible, easy-to-understand depiction of an economy rigged against ordinary people, and the lack of transparency and unpredictability vexed consumers. “It was hiding in plain sight and everyone has found it and you just can’t unsee it,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. Politicians looking for anti-inflation messaging rode the wave of constituent anger. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) challenged Delta’s palpable glee over surveillance pricing in an earnings call, and when Delta responded that they wouldn’t actually target customers using their personal data, Gallego didn’t let up. After all, Delta’s president Glen Hauenstein said on the earnings call that “to get [travelers] the right offer in your hand at the right time” is the “Holy Grail,” which sure sounds like surveillance pricing. “Delta is telling their investors one thing, and then turning around and telling the public another,” Gallego said in a statement. House Democrats proposed a bill to ban surveillance pricing and surveillance wage-setting. So-called “drip pricing,” where junk fees are added during a sale, was effectively banned in event ticketing and hotel stays by an FTC rule finalized in May. But with GOP control of Washington, the real action has moved to the states. Surveillance pricing bans were introduced in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota; surge pricing bans for grocery stores and restaurants were introduced in New York and Maine. By July, 24 states had seen bills introduced over some form of technology-aided pricing, according to a tracker from Consumer Reports. In a major win this year, the nation’s two largest blue states explicitly banned algorithmic price-fixing, a tactic famously used by RealPage, which aggregated data from landlords across a city and recommended coordinated rent hikes. Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued RealPage, reaching settlements with corporate landlords vowing to end the practice. But data aggregators like Agri Stats and PotatoTrac already do this for meat and produce, and states wanted to prevent tech-enabled collusion from expanding. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Advocates were pushing on an open door; housing is the biggest monthly expense people have. “When RealPage came out, it quickly mapped onto something people feel viscerally,” said Samantha Gordon, chief advocacy officer at TechEquity, which lobbied on the California tech pricing bills. Moreover, since price-fixing is illegal when human beings enter a smoke-filled room and collude, extending that to algorithmic collusion made sense to lawmakers. That was the concept behind California’s AB 325, which states that “common pricing algorithms,” whether informed through public or nonpublic competitor data, violate the Cartwright Act, California’s antitrust law. The law lowers the evidence standard to prove an algorithmic pricing conspiracy. It also prohibits anyone from distributing a pricing tool that coerces the setting of a recommended price, protecting small businesses along with consumers, explained Hepner, who was active in drafting the bill. “We saw mom-and-pop businesses swept up into these pricing schemes,” he said. “If you want to get the buy box on Amazon, you have to use their smart pricing tool. You have to give up independent decision-making authority to participate in the economy.” After seven rounds of amendments, AB 325 passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed it in October. Days later, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) signed S.7882, another prohibition on coordinated price-fixing via software, though limited to rental housing. The New York law also blocks landlords from using algorithms to set “lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions.” Cities like Jersey City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Seattle have enacted similar citywide collusion bans, and 51 algorithmic price-fixing bills were introduced nationwide in just the 2025 legislative session. It’s “a potentially very powerful first step in tilting some of this economy back in favor of consumers,” Hepner said. The best way to get at surveillance pricing might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. Surveillance pricing bills have not seen the same success, though their failure revealed critical information. In California, AB 446, which would have banned pricing based on personal data, was held back, giving sponsors time to build support next year. That’s because businesses across the economy, even ones not suspected of surveillance pricing, swarmed Sacramento to defend their practices. “It was fascinating over the course of that legislative process to see the opposition come out and openly say, ‘Hey, we’re actually doing this, you mean we can’t do this anymore?’” Hepner told me. Some economists allege that tech pricing crackdowns threaten discounts and other potential benefits for consumers. But it’s hard to believe that companies would hire the most sophisticated engineers to figure out how to reduce their revenues. As Nguyen told me, the argument to preserve discounts boils down to this: “You can have privacy or low prices, but you can’t have both.” A modest breakthrough came in New York, which passed a disclosure law requiring that relevant transactions include a pop-up stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The National Retail Federation sued to block the law, but in October, a federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that the disclaimer “is plainly factual.” Advocates believe that the legal victory will give policymakers permission to revisit the topic. But the fierce pushback showed that AI-based pricing was no longer a speculative harm. “So many companies and industries trying to kill [surveillance pricing bans] told us everything we need to know on why everything is getting more and more expensive,” Gordon concluded. RealPage got the message as well. As the price-fixing bills worked their way through statehouses, the company announced it was acquiring Livble, a property management software tool. With Livble integrated into their platform, RealPage said, residents could subdivide rental payments into installments based on real-time cash flow landlords can see. In other words, RealPage was trying out surveillance pricing. THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS FROM ONE SCHEME to the next make it difficult for policymakers to stay ahead of the curve. For example, Lyft, one of the early adopters of surge pricing, reacted to rider anger about the service being more expensive precisely when they needed it most by moving to something called Price Lock, a subscription-based pricing tool that caps fares on targeted routes—for a monthly fee. Another tactic involves redefining basic terms. When Delta claimed it would not use personal data, it added that it was merely “enhanc[ing] our existing fare pricing processes” with AI. “The lack of regulations about this and the way people’s data can be collected and used allows them to play around with what they are calling personal data and use,” said Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. This forces policymakers to think more broadly, even on the outer edges of the possible. “I do worry that we’re always going to be chasing the companies,” said Sam Levine. “I think companies need to advertise a price publicly that’s available to all consumers … there should be a basic principle to advertise a price and it’s deceptive to charge more than that.” Levine’s testimony to Congress this summer hits on another option: limiting collection of personal data, rather than just its usage. “‘Surveillance pricing’ is only possible because of how companies collect, share, and weaponize our personal data,” he told lawmakers, while arguing that relying on outdated tools to safeguard privacy risked further abuse. Consumer protection and anti-monopoly experts are warming to this idea of cutting the data off at the source. Companies, after all, provide a full road map of what they collect in the privacy policies almost nobody reads. Levine and Nguyen’s loyalty program paper documents privacy policies, finding that rental car giant Hertz admits to collecting demographic and behavioral data, Home Depot tracks Wi-Fi usage inside their stores, and Macy’s captures customer driver’s licenses. Much of this data is sold to third-party data brokers, who share it with other businesses. A data minimization standard could prevent use of personal information for pricing, Winters suggested. Mekki added that antitrust law recognizes that antitrust remedies often call for disgorgement of whatever gives companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Applied to surveillance pricing, that would argue for destroying the data allowing them to price-set. “If you can be forced to give up money or property, it stands to reason that you need to give up data,” she said. The bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act introduced last year would have limited collection of certain kinds of data and given people the ability to opt out of having their data used to target them or sold to third parties. But this is at least the third major comprehensive privacy bill in the internet era that’s gone nowhere in Congress; too many companies are invested in the surveillance economy to let it be legislated out of existence. “This is a textbook example of people not getting what they want,” said Wu, whose recent book The Age of Extraction highlights Big Tech platform-ization multiplying across the economy. “Is there anyone in America who wants less privacy or thinks it’s fine, or really wants targeted ads? The constituency is zero … In 20 years of privacy laws, there hasn’t been a single vote. This is not even a conspiracy. The tech industry lobbyists specialize in one thing: killing privacy laws.” Some states have fared better, with a dozen passing limitations on data collection or letting consumers opt out of targeted ads or sale of personal data. California updated its policy this legislative session by passing AB 566, which allows internet users to opt out of data collection at the browser level, rather than having to go website by website. But practically all privacy legislation has carve-outs for “bona fide loyalty programs,” giving companies an escape hatch under the guise of offering discounts. Even given that, however, loyalty programs are not exempt from “excessive” collection under these statutes that is not reasonably necessary. Maryland recently finalized a privacy law that prevents companies from conditioning loyalty programs on the sale of data, despite industry pushback. The best way to get at this activity might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. That includes companies acting as data brokers by selling and trading data, and the third-party pricing consultants they share the data with. Data sales could be considered unfair or deceptive under state consumer protection laws. And even when customers consent to having their data collected, they may not be consenting to transferring that data to third parties. “State enforcers should be thinking, under what circumstances is it lawful for companies to share personal data with pricing consultants?” Levine said. Under Lina Khan, the FTC made headway by looking at these agglomerations of data as unfair practices, and subsequently prohibiting the sale of sensitive data, like when someone visits an abortion clinic. Today’s FTC has walked away from this enforcement, but their past work outlines a path for states to argue that targeted pricing is similarly unfair. AI PRICING WON’T LOOK THE SAME IN FIVE YEARS as it does now, but we have hints of where it’s going. That’s why the role of Fetcherr is more interesting than Delta’s meandering explanations for how it uses AI. Airlines have been at the forefront of every pricing innovation of the past 30 years, from junk fees to differential pricing to loyalty programs. What’s the next frontier? Fetcherr, which closed $90 million in funding in 2024 and another $42 million this year, tells you right on its website: “hyper-personalization at scale.” (Or at least, it used to tell you that, before it scrubbed this section.) “We’re talking about understanding each customer as an individual, optimizing every interaction for maximum value,” the now-redacted section states, detailing how its AI model uses data points like “customer lifetime value, past purchase behaviors, and the real-time context of each booking inquiry” to give each passenger their own product bundle at a bespoke price. The goal isn’t just a pleasant customer experience—it’s “revenue growth.” Robby Nissan, a Fetcherr co-founder, has said publicly that its AI systems can “manipulat[e] the market in order to gain more profit.” There’s not a lot of mystery here. There are other airline pricing consultants, like Peter Thiel–backed FLYR and PROS and Air Price IQ. But the pitch is the same: maximizing travelers’ willingness to pay by analyzing reams of data. If you want to see the dystopia of perfect information accurately predicting exactly how much you’ll pay for a service, just book a flight this Christmas. “It’s a very real example of how AI-based pricing schemes put consumers into economic silos,” Hepner said. “You cannot comparison shop anymore. You cannot predict what a price is supposed to be anymore.” This is facilitated by a concentrated economy where markets aren’t as open to alternatives to AI-optimized schemes. But AI pricing may shrink choice even further. For example, Delta recently stopped flying from LAX to London Heathrow Airport, despite the popularity of the route. Virgin Atlantic still makes the LAX-Heathrow trip; it’s a joint venture partner with Delta, and perhaps as important, both of them use Fetcherr. Was canceling the route an AI-enabled suggestion to benefit another client? We will never know. Large market models running millions of price tests with thousands of input signals could short-circuit restrictions on surveillance pricing or data minimization. If it’s all just simulations, after all, is it really using personal data? Another future is glimpsed in the rise of AI agents that shop for you. ChatGPT users will soon be able to link their PayPal accounts for instant purchases based on chatbot recommendations. Walmart has partnered with OpenAI for e-commerce as well. Autonomous bots with a linked bank account could even shop on their own, something a new AI agent lobby is trying to facilitate in Washington. There’s little transparency on how products are recommended, how prices are derived, or whether AI agents will act in the interest of consumers or the retailers they’re partnering with. “You’re delegating purchasing power to one algorithm to interface with another,” said Ben Winters. “You’re getting people signed up into these systems where they have no control.” But there’s also a brighter future possible, one where the backlash to nonstop data collection and pricing subterfuge accelerates, and people simply demand a fair price. Polling shows that the public is deeply skeptical that AI will work in their favor. Consumers may not have much control, but they do hold the dollars companies need to thrive, and they can withhold them from companies that treat them poorly. “I think it’s possible that this is headed back to cost-based pricing,” said Owens, whose book Gouged about the new era of pricing releases next year. “It’s the way companies priced for decades … There is a world where the outcome is transparent, public, predictable pricing.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: The New Bubble: How AI and Passive Investing Have Turned the Market into a Powder Keg

The US equity market is a bubble. Here is why: In my mind, to be defined as a “bubble” the potential for a sudden “pop” needs to be there. No matter how you define it, the probability of an extremely large drawdown in the S&P 500 has exponentially increased in the past few years. This doesn’t mean it is a high probability — it just means the tail has gotten much fatter. The main reason for this is index concentration is now being coupled with earnings concentration. Firstly, passive investing has clearly contributed to the top market caps consistently outperforming over the past decade. Passive is inherently pro-momentum. As these stocks were rewarded, it became easier for the companies to use their balance sheet for buying up competitors, seeking top talent, cheap access to debt so they could buy back more shares, etc. It has been a snowball of positive forces for the big tech space in the past 15 years and FLOWS have been a big part of it. However, what has notably changed in the past few years is that their actual earnings have become much more correlated. Yes, Google and Meta at the end of the day are ad companies. Those ads are seen on the screen of an iPhone. They feed Amazon orders. And all of that runs on the cloud behind the scenes. So in a way they have always had very correlated earnings growth, but now they are intertwining even more. Headlines from the past 12 months to give a taste: The Mag 7’s earnings as a percentage of the overall index has surged higher. That is because they are feeding each other’s growth now. Their balance sheets are becoming more and more intertwined while their market caps have become fueled by similar hopes. The point here is this: passive investing led to an increase in correlation of these stocks and contributed to their outperformance. But now, AI has led to a further increase in correlation at the fundamental level. To me, this is now what defines this market as a bubble. It is not about all-time high valuations. It is the fact that the stocks are all being pushed higher by similar forces (passive flows and buybacks) while at the fundamental level they are becoming more intertwined by the OBVIOUSLY permeable, flammable, and house-of-cards AI euphoria. Speaking of nuts… We have just had 27 leveraged 3x and 5x single stock ETFs filed by Volatility Shares. 3x AMD ETF 3x AMZN ETF 3x COIN ETF 3x CRCL ETF 3x GOOGL ETF 3x MSTR ETF 3x NVDA ETF 3x PLTR ETF 3x TSLA ETF 3x Bitcoin ETF 3x Ether ETF 3x Solana ETF 3x XRP ETF 3x VIX ETF 5x AMD ETF 5x AMZN ETF 5x COIN ETF 5x CRCL ETF 5x GOOGL ETF 5x MSTR ETF 5x NVDA ETF 5x PLTR ETF 5x TSLA ETF 5x Bitcoin ETF 5x Ether ETF 5x Solana ETF 5x XRP ETF From a broader perspective… These “5x bullish” ETFs are scheduled to be listed towards the end of the year. We believe this may accurately coincide with a top in the market. Great caution is now warranted… if you’ve been with us for some time you will know that we shy away from bombastic sensationalist type of commentary and so we do not say this lightly. This is the most apprehensive we have been since the GFC for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 at least!

A major vaccine producer came under pressure following a report federal health regulators plan to tighten vaccine approval rules. Meanwhile, an agreement with the world's most valuable company bolstered a software firm whose products help customers design and test semiconductors. Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground to start December after a strong week to end November. The Nasdaq slipped 0.4%, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Dow dropped 0.9%. See here for more from Investopedia on the day's market moves. Shares of Moderna (MRNA), which makes the bulk of its revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine, tumbled 7% to lead losses on the S&P 500 after a report the Food and Drug Administration plans to overhaul its process for evaluating vaccines, requiring more evidence of safety and efficacy prior to approval. Novavax (NVAX), BioNTech (BNTX), and Pfizer (PFE) also slid. Shares of Sandisk (SNDK), a maker of memory cards and other data storage products, dropped close to 6%. With the move lower Monday, Sandisk reversed gains last week on enthusiasm for the stock's S&P 500 debut. Despite the decline to start December, Sandisk shares have still notched big gains since the company completed its spinoff from Western Digital (WDC) in February, bolstered by AI-driven memory demand. Despite showing signs of a possible recovery last week, the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other major cryptocurrencies plunged Monday. Shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell about 5%, while shares Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers access to crypto on its trading platform, lost 4%. Synopsys (SNPS) was the best-performing stock in the benchmark index Monday as shares jumped around 5% after the provider of electronic design automation software announced an expanded partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Synopsys, and the two companies will collaborate on agentic and physical AI applications. Nvidia stock added 1.7%. Shares of footwear and apparel company Deckers Outdoor (DECK) rose 4.5%. Late last month, analysts at Stifel upgraded Deckers stock to "buy" from "hold," pointing to an upbeat growth outlook for the company's Hoka shoe brand, solid demand for the Ugg brand, and a strong international sales. The company offered rare discounts on Hoka sneakers for Black Friday. A pair of transport and logistics companies also got a boost following bullish comments from analysts at BMO Capital. Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) shares each added over 3% after BMO analysts issued "outperform" ratings for the stocks.

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy
URL: https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/01/k-shaped-economy/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T21:00:04Z
Full Content:
By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-2025-spending-deals-inflation/

Watch CBS News Updated on: December 1, 2025 / 3:43 PM EST / CBS News Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts. Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago. The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market. Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said. "A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less," Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. "So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth." He added, "This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did." Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April. Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few "big ticket" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck. Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers. Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays. Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. Spending among the bottom 80% of households — or those earning less than $175,000 a year — has "simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic," Zandi wrote in a September social media post. That's creating a so-called K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs. "Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer," Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. "Widening behavioral gap — high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious." For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted. "So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well," he said. "Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too."

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alex Wong / Getty Images News via Getty Images This is the next in our series on the worst CEOs in America. There will be an all-time winner later in the year. These chief executives were picked based on their major strategy stumbles, as well as how decisions they made affected shareholders, customers, and employees. Some of these CEOs are fairly new to the public corporations they run. Others have had their jobs for years. It is a good thing for investors that they will not have Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) CEO Brian Cornell to kick around anymore. He has taken the retailer through a ruinous period. He took the job in 2014. The Target board showed remarkably bad judgment and kept Cornell on as executive board chair. In a second shocking development, the board made Michael Fiddelke, current chief operating officer, the new CEO as of February 1, 2026. As Cornell ruined Target, Fiddelke helped him. When the board announced the decision, Neil Saunders of GlobalData commented, “The biggest mistake is actually keeping Brian Cornell on the board and making him the chair. It’s just ludicrous. You’re rewarding failure, and everybody at Target knows that.” jeepersmedia / Flickr Target’s stock performance has been horrible. Over the past five years, it is down 49% while the market is up 88%. In the past year, it is down 30% as the market has risen 15%. Year to date, the figures are about the same. By way of comparison, Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up 118% in the past five years and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) 135% higher. Target has been dogged quarter after quarter by bad earnings. In the most recently reported quarter, net sales fell 1.5% to $25.3 billion. Earnings decreased 18.2% to $1.52 per share. For the first three quarters of the year, the figures were just as poor. Revenue fell 1.7% to $74.3 billion, and earnings dropped 9.6% to $5.85 per share. According to Yahoo Finance, of 38 analysts who follow Target, 28 rate it as Sell or Hold. Their average price target is $96.52, barely up from the current price of $90.62. As Morningstar pointed out, “Though the 2026 leadership transition from CEO Brian Cornell (after 11 years at the helm) to COO Michael Fiddelke (a 20-year veteran of the business) could incite change, we’re skeptical it will be meaningful enough to regain lost market share or materially shift Target’s competitive standing given his long tenure at the retailer.” It may be that the largest single insult to Target shareholders is that Cornell made $20,407,603 in 2024. The insult to employees is that he made 753 times their median compensation. During the period when Cornell was CEO, everyone lost but him.

Title: The K-shaped economy means inflation hurts at the bottom and swells the assets at the top
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/01/what-is-k-shaped-economy-inequality-inflation-rich-poor/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T14:28:15Z
Full Content:
From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. ___ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How to handle ‘nepo babies’ in this economic climate
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/01/how-to-handle-nepo-babies-in-this-economic-climate/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T13:49:00Z

Kristin Stoller is an editorial director at Fortune focused on expanding Fortune's C-suite communities. Good morning! It’s no secret that the job market for Gen Z isn’t great—and many young people rely on their parents for help, ranging from financial support to health insurance to job leads. One 2024 study found that more than half of Gen Z asked their parents to find them job opportunities, with 53% of that group reporting that their parents had found them jobs to apply to through personal connections. Julia Lamm, PwC’s principal of workforce solutions, told me she suspects more parents will be trying to pull strings for their adult kids in this economic climate. But how should workplaces deal with “nepo babies”? Lamm had a few suggestions to make sure the hiring process is still fair, and those without connections aren’t shut out. “The really good companies will completely blind [the connection] from the decision-making process so you don’t even know it’s a referral,” she said. “You try to hide that so that it’s inherently an unbiased process.” If that proves impossible—as is often the case when the referred person is related to an owner, founder, or executive at a company—Lamm suggests thinking about a revamp of how entry-level employees engage with the company. One firm she works with is considering a rotational program for junior employees to get hands-on experience with different parts of the company. “It’s to truly support the development of the nepo babies so that if they do rise to a role in the organization that’s going to be a leadership role, they will be credible,” she said. “They will have the experience, and they will be able to properly steer the organization so that the ‘nepo’ part was just opening the door, and they do the rest.” Nepo friends should be treated in a similar fashion. In addition to blind hiring processes, Lamm recommends making sure those employees that were hired by friends in leadership roles be subject to secondary, unbiased reviewers during performance review season. “Sometimes what happens is you … bring your friend on over, and because they were successful in another organization, you think they’re going to be successful here,” Lamm said. “That is not always the case. Those are the scenarios where I’ve seen it go south.” Kristin StollerEditorial Director, Fortune Live Mediakristin.stoller@fortune.com A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

Title: He predicted an automation crisis years ago. Now, Andrew Yang says AI may wipe out 40 million jobs over the next decade.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Andrew Yang has warned for several years that automation would upend the American workforce. In the run-up to his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he predicted that self-driving cars alone could displace a million mostly male truck drivers with limited education — a shift that could "destabilize society" and even trigger "riots in the street," he told The New York Times in 2018. Seven years later, Yang says the crisis he feared is no longer hypothetical. "It's aging very, very well, unfortunately," he told CNN's Michael Smerconish of his predictions in a recent interview. Recent analyses indicate that AI and automation are already capable of performing a significant share of US labor tasks and are reshaping employment. MIT's Iceberg Index, released last week, found that current AI systems can already technically perform skills representing 11.7% of the US labor market — roughly $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services. The New York Times, citing internal Amazon strategy documents and interviews, reported in October that the company believes automation could allow it to avoid hiring more than 600,000 US workers over the next few years, and that its robotics team has an ultimate goal of automating 75% of its operations. Salesforce, Walmart, HP, IBM, and Fiverr have all cited AI in recent rounds of layoffs or announced layoffs tied to AI. "44% of American jobs are either repetitive manual or repetitive cognitive and thus could be subject to AI and automation," Yang said in the interview with CNN. "We're seeing that unfold right now." Yang's 44% estimate is broadly in line with some major studies on automation. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it. A McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report released last month found that technologies could theoretically automate more than half of US work hours. Yang pushed back against Roman Yampolskiy, a computer science professor at the University of Louisville and an AI safety researcher, who in September predicted 99% unemployment within five years. "It's going to get bad. I certainly don't think 99% bad," Yang said. Using his 44% vulnerability benchmark, Yang offered a rough projection: if the US "churns through" even half of those jobs over the next decade, the country could see 30 to 40 million positions eliminated. "That would be devastating," he said. "That would be catastrophic for many, many communities." The rapid pace of AI-driven disruption has revived Yang's signature policy idea: a universal basic income that gives every American adult $1,000 a month, no strings attached. He said guaranteed cash would help workers survive the shockwaves of automation and maintain basic economic stability. To fund a nationwide program, Yang said the firms driving AI's explosive growth should bear the cost. He cited Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who floated to Axios in May the idea of a "token tax" that the government should levy on AI companies. With tech giants generating "hundreds of billions" in value — powered in part by data the public never knowingly provided — Yang said an AI tax or "compute tax" could raise "very big numbers very quickly." Given that the US produced roughly $85,000 in GDP per person in 2024, according to the World Bank, Yang said his $12,000 annual Freedom Dividend "seems pretty modest and reasonable." Yang said that a cash stipend isn't a cure-all — people also need purpose, structure, and a sense of community. But without financial stability, he said, millions risk being left behind and pushed toward radicalization. "We could be doing much, much more for the millions of Americans who are going to be displaced," Yang said. Jump to

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” In this June 15, 2018 file photo, twenty dollar bills are counted in North Andover, Mass. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, the Bank of America Institute found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” This photo combination shows, from Fairlife milk on display at an Indianapolis grocery store, Jan. 23, 2015, Coca-Cola cans displayed at a grocery store in Mount Prospect, Ill., July 17, 2025, and bottles of Lifewtr and Smartwater displayed in Philadelphia, March 16, 2017. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, Nam Y. Huh, Matt Rourke) Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained ... between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” A security guard is seen next to a road block near the New York Stock exchange, Jan. 14, 2022, in the Financial District. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. ___ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: How Campbell’s leaked audio turned a pantry staple into a PR crisis

Time Published: 2025-12-01T12:17:05Z
Full Content:
Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Just as families across the U.S. were heading into Thanksgiving weekend and stocking up on Campbell’s staples, a leaked audio recording landed online of a company vice president mocking Indian workers, calling customers “poor people,” and claiming its soups contained “bioengineered” or “3D” meat. The timing was combustible. A brand associated with holiday comfort was suddenly overshadowed by a senior leader’s contemptuous voice, directed at the very people who buy and make its products. Campbell confirmed the recording’s believed authenticity and removed the executive from his role. Several elements of the story emerged through a lawsuit filed by cybersecurity analyst Robert Garza, who alleges he told his manager about the comments in January, was discouraged from reporting them, and was later terminated. Campbell disputes that timeline, saying it first learned of the lawsuit months later and heard only “segments” of the audio on November 20. Regardless of how those details are adjudicated, once the recording went public, the question shifted from one executive’s conduct to the organization’s ability to confront issues before they escalate. These alleged events surfaced three essential truths about leadership that extend far beyond this single episode. The blowback was swift because Campbell is not merely a food manufacturer. Its products occupy a symbolic place on holiday tables, and the remarks felt like a direct insult to the households that rely on them. Consumers interpreted the comments as a reflection of how a leader with influence viewed the people who sustain the brand. Culture is judged in moments like this—not by corporate messaging but by private conduct that contradicts it. The allegations about internal handling reveal a more profound leadership truth: Trust within companies is fragile. Reporting systems work only when employees believe their concerns will be taken seriously rather than met with indifference or retaliation. When people think the organization is unwilling or unable to act, the crisis becomes bigger than the initial misconduct. The episode also highlights the modern fact that private comments are never entirely private. Power attracts scrutiny, and the tools to record unguarded moments are everywhere. The answer is to ensure that even one’s private behavior is consistent with the values the company claims to uphold. The final takeaway: What happened at Campbell ultimately reinforces why leadership is judged at its edges. The quiet moments and the offhand comments reveal far more about a leader’s integrity and C-suite readiness than any formal performance review ever could.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

HP will cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by 2028 as the company leans into AI adoption, CEO Enrique Lores said during a Q4 earnings call. This "company-wide initiative [aims to] drive customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement," HP says. The layoffs will primarily affect those in product development, internal operations, and customer support roles, and are expected to be implemented by the end of fiscal year 2028. HP expects the job cuts to save nearly $1 billion by the end of 2028. "Structural cost savings represent gross reductions in costs driven by operational efficiency, digital transformation, and portfolio optimization," HP says. "These initiatives include but are not limited to workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation and productivity measures undertaken by HP, which HP expects to be sustainable in the longer-term." Lores promised to provide "the full plan on how AI is transforming HP" at the company's Investor Day on April 23. HP cut a similar number of jobs in 2022; it also laid off 9,000 people in 2019. As of October 2024, HP's headcount reportedly stood at 58,000, meaning the recently announced layoffs could reduce the workforce by about 7-10%. Notably, the company's PC business closed the fiscal year with a net revenue of $10.4 billion, an 8% year-over-year growth, while its printer business brought in $4.3 billion, down 4% year over year. HP now joins a long list of tech giants announcing layoffs due to AI-driven restructuring or cost cuts. Intel said it would reduce 15% of its workforce in June; Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs in July; Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October; and Verizon just cut 13,000 jobs last month.

Title: DoorDash CEO Tony Xu outmaneuvered meal delivery rivals by obsessing over his customer
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/01/doordash-ceo-tony-xu-delivery-wars-obsessing-over-customer/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:39:57Z
Full Content:
Good morning. If Americans treated their post-Thanksgiving Day exhaustion with take-out this weekend, there’s a good chance they ordered from DoorDash. The meal delivery giant now controls 60% of the market in the U.S and is more than twice the size of its closest competitor, Uber Eats. It wasn’t always that way. In a new Fortune feature, tech correspondent Jason Del Rey rode along with DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on a delivery run and got a front-seat look at how Xu built the scrappy upstart into an unexpected powerhouse in the cutthroat meal delivery industry. The startup founded in 2013 by Xu and three fellow Stanford students once had less than $30,000 left in its bank account. Now, thanks to grit, ingenuity, and a heaping serving of luck, it’s on track to generate more than $13 billion this year. Here a few lessons other leaders can learn from DoorDash and CEO Xu:Zig when others zag: Early on, DoorDash distinguished itself in the crowded meal delivery space by enlisting gig workers to pick up—and sometimes even order—food, whereas then-rivals Grubhub and Seamless only partnered with restaurants that had their own delivery drivers. Obsess over your customer: Xu prides himself on sweating the small stuff to improve service. For instance, DoorDash now highlights desserts on orders because they are the most likely to be forgotten. Its app also advises “Dashers” on where to park and which building entrance to use. Stay in touch with the front-line experience: Every corporate DoorDash employee in the U.S. must do four delivery shifts a year. On Jason’s ride-along, CEO Xu attempted to deliver four orders in San Francisco. He managed to drop off three and earned $19 for the hour’s worth of work. (DoorDash would top up that amount.) Xu’s hands-on experience stands out in a world in which the ultra-wealthy are living increasingly private lives. Strike when there’s blood: When Uber Eats’ parent was rehabilitating its culture and imposing financial discipline in the late 2010s, DoorDash went on a spending blitz. It poached several UberEats executives and expanded from 1,500 locations to 6,000, including into mid-tier cities and suburban towns that rivals had neglected. Be ready when opportunity hits: DoorDash’s investment in the suburbs paid off when the COVID pandemic pushed convenience-obsessed consumers out of cities and turned sit-down restaurants on to delivery. DoorDash’s business more than tripled in 2020. Jason cautions that DoorDash’s lead isn’t safe. It could “be displaced by a competitor like Uber—or an AI-native company that may not yet even exist.” But for now it’s won the meal delivery wars and is moving into new markets, like grocery delivery, where the battle for dominance may be just as fierce. You can read the full feature here. —Claire ZillmanContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump to announce Fed chair pick U.S. President Donald Trump says he’s decided who will succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair. “We’ll be announcing it,” he said Sunday. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly the frontrunner for the job but declined to address whether he was the top candidate in an interview Sunday. Gen Z penny-pinching Gen Z shoppers, those in their teens to early 20s, plan on spending less this holiday season as economic uncertainty takes hold. A Deloitte survey shows they plan to cut spending 34% this year, steeper than any other cohort. Only Gen Xers, aged 45 to 60, plan to spend more. Frozen salaries Major consulting firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group have frozen starting salaries for the third straight year as AI imposes more cautious hiring practices in the industry. AI is making junior employees more productive, putting downward pressure on their pay. Smartphone risks for kids A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that children who had a smartphone by age 12 were at higher risk of depression, obesity, and inadequate sleep compared to their phoneless peers. The research included 10,500 kids in the U.S., making it the largest long-term look at children’s brain development in the country to date. AI job displacement An MIT study published last week found that nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce could already be replaced by AI systems. The report notably found that AI models can complete tasks in finance and health care, not just in technology or coding. Great Wealth Transfer won’t be a ‘big bang’ Northwestern Mutual CEO Tim Gerend told Fortune that the Great Wealth Transfer between Baby Boomers and younger generations won’t be a “big bang” like many expect but instead will come gradually. For young people who are “really anxious” about the economy, per Gerend, waiting for that inheritance only adds to their unease. S&P 500 futures are down 0.55% this morning. The last session closed up 0.54%. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.44% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.03% in earning trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.89%. China’s CSI 300 was up 1.10%. The South Korea KOSPI was down 0.16%. India’s NIFTY 50 is down 0.10%. Bitcoin was down at $87K.

Title: Sources of America’s Hidden Inflation

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Prices have been rising across the economy in ways that are both visible and opaque. There are short-term drivers of inflation due to President Trump’s mismanagement of the economy. But the deeper drivers result from the degradation of capitalism. For example, the lethal combination of digital technology and tech monopolies picks your pocket in countless ways. Instead of technical advances leading to greater convenience and lower cost, as they logically should, they create strategies for opportunistic price hikes. More from Robert Kuttner When Amazon uses its deep knowledge of consumer preferences to rig markets and undermine competitors, higher prices are passed along. When HP makes it illegal or impossible for consumers to use cheaper non-HP cartridges in their printers, it can charge exorbitant prices. If you are prohibited from repairing your own car or your own iPhone, or as a farmer, prohibited from saving seed for next year’s planting, that invites monopoly profits built on higher prices. Costs rise because the rules are rigged. It isn’t just the increasing cost of health insurance, but the tax on your time when a health system of byzantine complexity requires you to waste hours to get a simple referral or get a claim paid. Middlemen and algorithms, both in the business of denying claims, are a direct cost to the system and a source of rising out-of-pocket prices to patients. If insurance doesn’t pay, you do. These middlemen also function as a drain on doctor time and thus a tax on doctors’ incomes, as well as a debasement of medical services In this special issue of the Prospect, we take stock of several hidden drivers of rising costs. David Dayen explores all the ways that technology allows sellers of any product that uses the internet to take advantage of surveillance capitalism to personalize prices and charge more than the market price that would be produced by ordinary supply and demand. It’s another case of monopoly pricing power, facilitated by invasive technology. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. As Emma Janssen writes, plutocracy is a driver of the affordability crisis. The top 10 percent of income earners now do close to half of the spending, by some estimates. This has led to “premiumization,” where airline seats, concert tickets, and even staple goods are priced for wealthier people because they are the primary buyers. That in turn drives prices higher for everyone else, as anyone who buys a ticket to a concert or a sporting event appreciates. Antitrust policy has thus far failed to curb obvious abuses by middlemen ticket sellers. Paul Starr writes in a sidebar that these trends invert the 20th-century pattern of affordable culture, beginning with nickel movie tickets and cheap bleacher seats. As the concert ticket example shows, middlemen are drivers of the affordability crisis. As Whitney Curry Wimbish writes, across the economy, from pharmaceuticals to real estate to meatpacking and more, middlemen sit in between suppliers and customers and squeeze out a layer of profit for themselves, taking advantage of their knowledge of industries and typically concentrated control of the supply chain. Regulatory capture, as James Baratta points out, is another source of price increases. Baratta’s focus is on electricity rates, and the failure of state public utility commissions to protect ratepayers from extractive price hikes based on dubious economic models used by utility companies. There is an even more subtle and insidious version of regulatory capture, in which regulations themselves are used to enforce industry’s anti-competitive strategies. As Cory Doctorow observes in his indispensable book Enshittification (reviewed in our October issue), far more sinister than traditional regulatory capture is regulatory fusion, in which industry designs laws and rules to thwart competition and raise profits. Using provisions of the industry-written 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Apple makes it a copyright violation for technicians to use non-Apple parts for most repairs to Apple products. The preposterous doctrine is that if an inferior non-Apple part caused the product to fail, that could reduce consumer confidence in Apple’s brand. There is even a name for this doctrine: tarnishment. TRUMP’S CONTRIBUTION TO RISING PRICES adds to these long-term abuses. Eric Winograd, a senior vice president at AllianceBernstein, calculates that Trump’s tariffs have added about one percentage point to the core inflation rate, though other estimates that account for Trump’s numerous exemptions of various products and industries put the number at 0.6 to 0.7 percent. But tariffs are only the beginning of Trump’s impact on prices. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. Internet innovators grew from purveyors of ingenuity and user convenience into extractive monopolies largely because antitrust enforcement ceased to exist from late in the Carter administration until Joe Biden’s appointments of some of the smartest students of abuses and their remedies: Lina Khan at the FTC, Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department, Rohit Chopra at the CFPB, and Tim Wu (whose latest book is reviewed in these pages) as competition policy chief at the White House. These agencies had just gotten serious about reversing four decades of corporate market power when the antitrust revolution was reversed by Trump. As antitrust enforcement has been aborted, private equity companies have been buying up traditionally local firms in order to use market power to raise prices, in sectors as diverse as pest control operations, HVAC companies, and veterinary practices In addition, Trump’s shutting down of Biden’s industrial policies has raised prices. Electric power costs have lately risen far faster than the general rate of inflation. Trump’s policy of killing renewable-energy projects, in order to raise profits for oil and gas companies, contributes to this price rise, by taking away power that might otherwise come onto the grid and alleviate demand. So does the failure to regulate the extensive use of electric power by data centers used by tech companies. There was a time when we needed to shift to solar and wind in order to help address climate change. But now that renewables are cheaper than most fossil fuels, we need to make that shift because it saves money. Instead, Trump promotes more costly oil and gas. It is hard to quantify precisely how much all of Trump’s policies taken together have added to price inflation, but a very conservative estimate would be about two percentage points. That may not sound like a lot, but it is the difference between a baseline inflation rate of 2.5 percent and a rate of 4.5 percent. And that difference is not just a hidden tax on consumers. It has knock-on effects. With inflation at 2.5 percent, the Federal Reserve is willing to reduce interest rates in order to reduce unemployment. But when price increases approach 4 percent, the Fed worries more about inflation. At a time when unemployment rates are rising, policies that raise prices tie the Fed’s hands. This paradoxically could make things more unaffordable for low-income workers, if a loose job market keeps wages from rising. It’s not clear whether there will be any more rate cuts in the near future, and there may even be rate increases. A Fed policy of tighter money means that people pay more for their mortgage loans, their credit card debt, their student loans, and consumers pay more when small businesses pay more for credit. Trump’s cuts in programs such as SNAP and Medicaid are another form of indirect price hikes; even worse, they are price hikes that hit the poor. If your food stamp allotment is reduced, you have to pay more out of pocket in order to eat. If your Medicaid is cut, you pay out of pocket or do without. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The failure to address climate change, and Trump’s reversal of long-standing policies aimed at preserving the environment, also add to costs. As destructive storms become more severe and frequent, the costs of recovery and of homeowner insurance relentlessly rise, some borne by consumers directly and some by taxpayers. This natural-world aspect of hidden inflation is addressed in another of our special articles, by Gabrielle Gurley. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE among economists and policymakers about whether the Consumer Price Index should be adjusted downward to reflect improvements in quality. A 2020 car was simply a better car than a 1980 car, so some of the nominal price inflation actually represented a superior product. Likewise coffee: In 1970, a cup of coffee only cost a dime, but the swill was undrinkable. Coffee today is a lot more expensive, but it is palatable. In practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did some minor revisions to adjust for quality improvements. Today, we might need to do the reverse. We are paying more money for products and services whose quality has deteriorated. And in many cases, the deterioration has been deliberate. Indeed, the business model of the tech giants is to systematically degrade the quality of products and services. Products are needlessly complex from the perspective of the consumer, but the complexity adds to the surveillance. Same with tech services. This is the essence of what Doctorow calls enshittification. Doctorow tells the story of how Google deliberately slowed down its search process in order to make more time for its system to festoon the search results with annoying ads that embody everything that Google knows about the user’s buying habits. In conventional economics, wages and prices are two different aspects of the economy. But whether people can afford to live decently is a function of what they earn applied to what they have to pay to live. The same technology that allows tech monopolists to gouge consumers enables them to treat workers like serfs and evade the protections of labor law. As Harold Meyerson writes in his piece, the cost of living is higher because earnings are lower. And earnings are lower because of both the weakening of the labor movement and the sidelining of the National Labor Relations Board. In addition, tech allows employers to double down on the old practice of denying that workers are payroll employees protected by labor laws. From Uber drivers and UPS contractors to chicken farmers and fast-food workers, the company controls and monitors every aspect of the work, but the employer pretends that the workers are independent contractors. This represents a toxic marriage of app technology and market power. The effect is to batter down earnings. And as Naomi Bethune writes, all of the predations tend to hit racial and ethnic minorities harder, because African Americans and Latinos are more economically vulnerable to begin with. Trump’s war on DEI only increases the vulnerability. EVEN APART FROM THE PREDATIONS of extractive and invasive capitalism, other sources of the relentless rise in prices are the result of policy failures that predate the abuses of surveillance capitalism and Donald Trump by decades. Housing is out of reach for so many Americans because America has failed to build enough houses. Houses were cheap after World War II mainly because cheap farmland was being converted to suburbia, with the help of federal highway and mortgage policies. The cheap land is gone, and homebuilder consolidation has distorted markets. Trump’s tariffs have caused a rise in building costs, and his proposal to privatize the secondary mortgage market would make financing more expensive. Housing tax breaks are tilted toward more expensive homes, and toward homeowners over renters. The sheer purchasing power of the oligarchy also bids up prices. Local regulatory barriers also raise costs, but many zoning restrictions also reflect the political power of oligarchs, who don’t want riffraff in their neighborhoods. The bipartisan failure to regulate new financial scams such as subprime mortgages added to the pressure on housing. Millions of homeowners, disproportionately Black and Hispanic, lost their homes in the wake of the subprime collapse. Congress passed legislation to allow for mortgage refinancing for duped homeowners, but the Obama administration failed to carry it out. You might think that scads of vacant and foreclosed houses would lead to lower prices via the law of supply and demand. But the same regulatory failure led private equity companies to swoop in, buy houses, and jack up prices and rents, while making homebuilders reluctant to build the additional units we need. Public policy has also failed to produce an adequate supply of affordable rental housing. The rental housing that we do subsidize is done in wildly inefficient ways, for the convenience and profit of landlords and developers. Our failure to have a true social-housing sector reflects power imbalances between oligarchs and ordinary citizens. The cost of higher education is out of sight because legislators, Republican and Democrat alike, permitted universities to inflate costs via the student loan program, and then piled debt onto generations of students and graduates. State legislatures compounded the damage by reducing direct appropriations to public universities that were free to state residents until a generation ago, substituting tuition and fees. It now costs more to attend a state university than what a private university cost when I was a student. Health care costs also keep rising because the United States has failed to adopt an efficient program of universal public health insurance, as every other major country has done. To compound the damage, policymakers have allowed a plague of for-profit middlemen to take over hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors’ practices. In many hospitals, people of means hire private nurses because the hospital’s own nursing staff is so stretched thin and overworked by cost-cutting aimed at siphoning profits. A hidden price hike, if you can afford it. If the U.S. had a universal nonprofit insurance system, it would save about 6 percent of GDP. That’s $1.2 trillion a year. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE ABUSES of capitalism were relatively straightforward and transparent. Large corporations sought to combine into monopolies. The remedy was enactment and enforcement of antitrust laws. Corporations tried to pay their workers as little as possible and to break their unions. The remedy was the Wagner Act, guaranteeing workers the right to organize and join unions. Bankers tried to swindle investors for their own enrichment. The remedy was tougher banking and securities laws, prohibiting conflicts of interest. Corporations tried to cheat consumers with tricky terms and shoddy products. The remedy was the pro-consumer legislation of the 1960s and 1970s. But today’s corporate and financial abuses are hidden in a web of algorithms and apps, reinforced by regulations that actually help tech companies cheat consumers rather than protect them. It takes a complex, deeply knowledgeable, and radical critique of capitalism as currently practiced to get serious about remedies. That does not describe about half of the current Democratic Party, which is on the take from these same industries. One of the many tragedies of Joe Biden was that he was a feeble spokesman for his own good policies. He hired the most knowledgeable people in the country to revive antitrust and apply it to new abuses. But Biden did poorly at narrating the significance of these policies to ordinary Americans coping with rising prices. As I’ve written elsewhere, many of these policies and people reflected the work of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was a superb narrator of what they meant and why we needed them. But we ended up with the soul of Elizabeth Warren in the feckless persona of Joe Biden. If we can make the heroic assumption that Trump will not be president forever, and that there will be an opportunity to pick up where Biden and Warren left off, America’s next leaders will need to be even more radical in their understanding and remediation of capitalism, which has become even more debased since Trump took office.

Just because Cyber Monday is over doesn't mean you missed out. We've spent the past several days (and nights!) tracking some of the best deals of the year, and while some of the best Cyber Monday sales ended promptly at midnight, we were pleased to see so many of them extending their discounts through this week. Some of the best ongoing deals we've spotted include 30% off a pair of Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, the best overall headphones we've tested, and 55% off the Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum. We're also still seeing multiple discounts on Apple smartwatches, including the brand-new Apple Watch SE 3, which is $50 off. And if you're starting to shop for the holidays and looking for something for the kids in your life, several giftable items are on sale, including up to 33% off the classic Razor scooter that you (and your ankles) might remember from your own childhood. Some stores share the details surrounding their promotional periods, while others don't have a specific publicized end date, so we recommend acting now if you see something you're interested in. Keep scrolling to explore some of the best deals still available, including offers on tech, streaming, home, kitchen, beauty, pets, and more. Our whole team has been working around the clock to cover all of this holiday's best deals, but as the editor who keeps a close eye on all categories year-round, I have a few favorite discounts. These are five sales that are especially rare or low, including some products that weren't even on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. — Sarah Saril, Editor, Deals and How to Watch This massive 14-qt. air fryer is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. The Magnus Pro has incredibly thoughtful cable management and supportive add-ons that make it a great choice for gamers, streamers, and anyone who uses multiple monitors and accessories. The Switch 2 comes with a range of new features for Nintendo gamers, including enhanced Joy-Con designs, improved performance, and more. This bundle comes with Mario Kart World, one of the console's exclusive titles, so you can get started playing right away. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads. There are five deals that I was pleased to see extend past Cyber Monday, ranging from can't-miss streaming service bundles to discounts on beloved hair dryers. A few of these offers will stick around until January, but others will most likely have a more limited lifespan. — Lillian Brown, Senior Associate Editor of Streaming This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. This compact massage gun boasts a convenient, travel-friendly design that remains powerful enough to deliver effective results. We also love its heated head, which we've found to speed up recovery. Garmin's Forerunner 165 is a runner's best friend. It offers key features like performance monitoring, personalized training plans, and recovery details. This Nespresso model pairs the brand's centrifugal brewing technology with a small countertop footprint and an elegant profile. Pair it with the bundled Aeroccino frother, and you have a coffeehouse setup at home. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. We've logged several solid price drops over the past few days, including discounts on headphones, gaming consoles, and smart home tech. You can also still save on electronic services like VPNs (virtual private networks) or cellular providers. The WH-1000XM5 are one of Sony’s top over-ear headphones. They boast excellent noise-canceling performance along with great audio quality and a truckload of convenient features. JLab’s Go Air Pop are the most affordable wireless earbuds that are actually still worth buying. This simple two-channel soundbar is an affordable yet capable audio system. It delivers good stereo separation and Bluetooth support. However, though it's technically capable of Dolby Atmos playback, it lacks the ability to showcase that format properly. Bose’s oil can-sized Portable Smart Speaker offers big sound, wireless charging capability, and compatibility with both Amazon’s and Google’s virtual assistants. It also boasts versatile connectivity options and strong functionality. If you're new to smart lighting, then the Philips Hue Starter Kit is a great place to begin. The Philips Hue light bulbs are easy to use and set up. This kit includes four bulbs and a Hue Bridge, a wireless hub that connects to your router. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, now with no data caps. We recommend signing up for this option to maximize your savings, as it's typically the most expensive option in the lineup. Mint Mobile's annual unlimited plan offers unlimited talk and text and truly unlimited high-speed data on T-Mobile's network (subject to deprioritization) for an unrivaled value at $15/month with a limited-time discount. Surfshark's VPN deal is one of the most affordable around and comes with three months extra for free, with prices starting from $1.99 a month. Unlike much of the competition, you can use it on an unlimited number of devices at once. The starter tier is more than enough for most users as it features robust encryption and will unlock international streaming with ease. The middle tier is only a touch more expensive and has extra features like a private search engine, antivirus, breach alerts, and more. NordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs. This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan, and you get an additional three months extra for no charge. Looking for an alternative VPN still packed with useful features and servers in over 110 countries? Then ProtonVPN is well worth a look, and it has a sizable discount on its two-year plan. If you'd prefer a shorter-term deal, the one-year plan is great value too and only costs $3.99 a month with the current 60% discount. Both plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features. TVs can get pricey, but these deals can help cut down on some of the costs of enhancing your home theater. We've found sales for some notable models, including gorgeous OLED sets with incredible contrast, wallet-friendly QLED options that still deliver plenty of brightness, and even stylish Frame TVs that double as artwork when they're not in use. Though we think the larger versions of Amazon's Omni QLED TV are overpriced for what you get, the 50-inch model offers an excellent balance between cost and performance. It has handy Alexa features and is one of the only 50-inch TVs available with local dimming, which enables solid contrast performance. The Hisense U8QG impresses with one of the brightest pictures on the market, and pairs that searing luminance with excellent contrast for a dynamic, punchy picture. Samsung's Frame TV is designed to look like a piece of art on your wall thanks to its flush mount, matte screen, and magnetic frame bezels. Its image quality is mediocre, but its style makes it a great pick for design-focused buyers. Walmart's Onn TVs are entry-level displays sold at highly competitive prices. Although their image quality is lacking, they still offer reliable Roku streaming. Onn TVs are decent budget buys if you're looking for an inexpensive set for casual viewing or a secondary room. The Roku Plus Series is the brand's most affordable QLED TV model. This new 2025 edition uses a Mini LED backlight for improved local dimming but it still can't match the HDR brightness capabilities of the step-up Pro Series. If you're looking for a more affordable alternative to Samsung's Frame TV, Hisense's Canvas is a solid option. It has a similar matte screen, slim mount, and bezel system. That said, it lacks the Frame's One Connect Box, and its viewing angles aren't great. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. The QN90F is one of the few premium QLED TVs made in a 50-inch screen size. It offers a bright image and features Samsung's anti-reflective matte screen, which significantly reduces glare. The S90F is an impressive midrange OLED and one of our favorite new displays of 2025. It gets a bit brighter than last year's S90D and offers better color volume than similar LG OLED models. The 83-inch C5 is a standout midrange OLED TV in this size. It offers an infinite contrast ratio and inky black levels while providing a modest boost in brightness compared to last year's C4 model. Several streaming sales ended with Cyber Monday, but there are still a few stellar offers available. Services with ongoing deals span from family-friendly apps, such as Disney Plus, to more targeted streamers, like Starz. A few of these deals can help you save on up to 12 months of service, a great way to temporarily ward off potential price hikes. This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads. The MyEntertainment package offers lifestyle and entertainment-centric channels (plus a few other surprises). Channel offerings include Bravo, FX, TLC, and more. Subscribers also gain access to ad-supported Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max. DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. Gaming gear is often one of the last items to go on sale, and things like PCs and consoles have been particularly pricey lately. But these sales offer a rare opportunity to cash in on some savings. Whether you're eyeing a PS5, a controller, or a new laptop, today's deals bring some of the steepest discounts we've seen in a while. The Switch 2 comes with a range of new features for Nintendo gamers, including enhanced Joy-Con designs, improved performance, and more. This bundle comes with Mario Kart World, one of the console's exclusive titles, so you can get started playing right away. The PS5 Pro has more powerful specifications compared to the standard PS5, enabling enhanced graphical settings and better frame rates on supported games. However, its high price tag will only appeal to big tech enthusiasts who demand the very best performance. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. Microsoft’s Xbox wireless controllers already come in a huge variety of colors, but you can also create your own custom controller with the Xbox Design Lab. The online tool will let you or your gift recipient decide how each part of the controller looks, including the buttons and thumbsticks. Pricing starts at just $10 more than a standard Xbox controller, and Microsoft recently opened customization to the premium Xbox Elite controller, which has extra buttons and a rubberized grip. Acer's budget gaming laptops offer a lot of power for a great price. This model includes one of Nvidia's newest GPUs, ensuring smooth performance in nearly any game. The Logitech G305 keeps it simple without compromising incredible performance. It's perfect for gaming, work, or whatever you use it for. The Logitech G502 is an iconic gaming mouse, and offers long battery life and a massive amount of customization. It's a cult favorite model that can hold up for hundreds of gaming sessions. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Magnus Pro has incredibly thoughtful cable management and supportive add-ons that make it a great choice for gamers, streamers, and anyone who uses multiple monitors and accessories. The Secretlab Titan Evo excels in every field, offering durability, style, adjustability, and supreme comfort. It's a great time of year to stock up on items that you might not normally think of, including home products that you need to buy anyway. From vacuums to space heaters, these are the best deals to hop on now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. The portable Bissell Little Green Mini is a great option for small spaces like apartments and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or even under your sink. The eufy Omni C20 is more compact, both the robot and its base station, but it doesn’t sacrifice auto-emptying dirt or auto-washing its mop pads. It’s a solid alternative to the growing size of some combo units, at an approachable price point. Dyson's V9 Motorbar has slightly less suction than the V8, but it shares the LCD screen found on higher-end models, which displays cleaning time, power mode, and maintenance alerts. It offers up to 40 minutes of cleaning time and has three cleaning modes. The Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro packs a cleaning punch, vacuuming and mopping with a ferocity few robots can muster. And it does so at a reasonable price. iRobot has managed to offer a budget-level vacuum-only robot with smart home mapping, meaning you can clean certain spaces as you wish and set no-go zones. It uses lidar technology to map your home to maximize coverage and navigate your space. It offers four suction levels. The Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 is the best fire pit we've tested because its design facilitates blazing fires with minimal smoke. Plus, it's available in seven colors. This cute, vintage-looking Vornado space heater is modeled after the company's original 1945 Vornado fan. It has few bells or whistles, but it's super effective at warming up small-to-medium-sized rooms. The Dyson Bladeless Heater isn't just a great heater and air conditioner — it's beautifully designed, too, so it'll fit well in any room. The Lasko Duo Comfort Heater did the best job of heating our test room. It features intuitive controls and doubles as a tower fan for year-round use. It's also a good time to upgrade your sleep setup, whether you're shopping for a new pillow or looking to take the plunge on a new mattress. Some of our favorite mattresses, beds, and sheets are marked down, including cozy picks from trusted brands like Brooklinen and Leesa — perfect if you've been meaning to refresh your bedroom without overspending. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. Its patented lumbar zone technology helps support proper spine alignment. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The Bear Hybrid mattress has six layers of foam and spring coils for a customized fit and great night's sleep. It's also made with a moisture-wicking cover, making it a great choice for hot sleepers. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Also receive a free sleep bundle worth $599 with a mattress purchase that includes pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector. Linen is breathable all year round and great for warm sleepers, and Brooklinen's set doesn't disappoint with its immediate softness. The hardcore bundle includes flat and fitted sheets, a duvet cover, and four pillowcases. Brooklinen's Luxe Sateen Core Sheet set is designed with an incredibly smooth feel that gets softer over time. Its tight weave is silky, soft, and versatile for year-round use. The Mellanni Iconic Collection Microfiber sheets are incredibly affordable with solid cooling properties, a wide range of color options, and OEKO-TEX certification. One of the best-selling items across the entirety of Wayfair, this upholstered storage bed uses a hydraulic lift mechanism to reveal ample space for storing extra bedding or off-season clothing. It's available in seven colors. The Silk & Snow Wooden Bed Frame is a reasonably priced bed frame made of sustainable wood that doesn’t require any tools or screws for assembly. You can also add on a headboard design, too. This upholstered wingback platform bed frame oozes sophistication but at a very accessible price point. It's available in five colors and full, queen, and king bed sizes. Couches, desks, coffee tables, and even Christmas trees are among the best furniture deals we've found. Don't miss out on these great savings from Wayfair, Joybird, Flexispot, West Elm, and more. This rich navy faux leather sofa with brass legs looks far more expensive than it really is. Reviewers say it's comfortable and easy to put together. The oversized Wilder Sleeper Sectional is comfortable from day to night. It features a classic pull-out design and a Tempur-foam mattress. This feminine and small-space-friendly writing desk features two storage drawers with reeded diamond fronts and shiny brass florette ring pulls. The soft blue-gray finish works as a unexpected neutral. Flexispot's most premium and heavy-duty offering, the E7 Pro has a powerful motor, greater adjustability, and a semi-C Leg structure for added stability and comes with a 15-year warranty. This mid-century West Elm coffee table is the pinnacle of versatility with built-in storage and a lift-top table for working on a laptop. We love it's mixed materials, with a marble inset top for visual interest. Invest in a piece of iconic Danish design. The Pacha Chair will be right at home in any living room seating arrangement or in a bedroom nook. The oversized low profile design is made for lounging. This sculptural wood console adds textural interest (and necessary storage) to your dining room, entryway, or living room. This classic grey-wash dining set includes four chairs, but the table can extend to comfortably seat up to 8 people. Gorgeously full and lush, the Balsam Hill Fraser Fir Artificial Christmas Tree is one of the most realistic artificial trees you can buy. Cyber Monday served up great deals for anyone who loves to cook, and many of the best discounts are still available. Air fryers, coffee makers, mixers, pot and pan sets, and even outdoor grills are all on sale, offering great savings on trusted brands like Keurig, Nespresso, and Ninja. If you've been thinking about upgrading your kitchen or grilling setup, this is an ideal time to do it for less. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. A gorgeous aesthetic and available colorways might be what catches your attention, but these pans by Caraway have more to offer. They combine great performance with excellent heat conductivity and ease of cleaning. The set also comes with a smart storage solution. The Ninja Dualbrew Pro offers all the same features and brewing options as the Ninja Specialty, with the addition of an attachment that allows the user to brew coffee from pods. This Nespresso model pairs the brand's centrifugal brewing technology with a small countertop footprint and an elegant profile. Pair it with the bundled Aeroccino frother, and you have a coffeehouse setup at home. Save space, time, and money with Keurig's Express brewer. It's not as narrow as the K-Mini, but it has a strong brew setting and a 42-ounce water tank, making it more practical for couples or small offices. The Technivorm Moccamaster is a premium drip coffee maker from the Netherlands known for its exceptional build quality, precise temperature control, and ability to brew a full pot of coffee that meets Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) standards. It delivers consistently flavorful, well-extracted coffee with a short brew time. The Breville the Barista Express is the best all-in-one, semi-automatic espresso machine you can find. Though newer, more expensive models have been released, this one is still our favorite. With its massive 26-quart size, the Ninja Foodi DT201 10-in-1 XL Pro Air Fry Convection Toaster Oven is one of the largest countertop air fryers you can buy, large enough to fit a 12-pound turkey. The Instant Vortex Plus was the best air fryer in our tests and features a window into the basket to monitor your food. Available in several candy-colored shades with a matte finish, Bella's Fit's Anywhere design is space-saving without compromising on capacity. It features six presets: air fry, bake, roast, broil, reheat, and dehydrate, along with an auto-shutoff mode. The Dreo Aircrisp Pro Air Fryer is the best compact air fryer we tested, making it perfect for single servings of wings and fries. This Traeger model might sound like it's aimed at professionals, but it’s simple enough for anyone to operate. It can be controlled with the spin of a dial or remotely via a mobile app. Best of all, it has 970 square inches of cooking space, so big parties or intimate dinners are both possible. The new Weber E-325 is a great mid-size grill for casual backyard cooks. Our two favorite features are the one-handed ignition and the Flavorizer bars that give the perfect sear. If you're headed into the winter looking to upgrade your home fitness game, you might be interested in some of the helpful sales on everything from trackers to gym equipment. Select deals on rowing machines, massage guns, and Apple Watches are still live. The Apple Watch SE 3 marks the most capable generation of the brand's budget smartwatch yet. It now comes powered by the S10 chip, with better battery life, and more. The Ultra 2 has been replaced by the new Ultra 3, which offers improved battery life and a more powerful processor, yet it remains one of Apple's top-tier smartwatches. If you can find it discounted for less than the Ultra 3, it still offers great value for athletes and adventurers. The Charge 6 boasts a more expansive feature set than the budget-friendly Inspire 3, catering to both fitness amateurs and enthusiasts. While it's a pricier option, it's still an amazing value for such a capable fitness tracker. Garmin's newest watch in the Vivoactive line adds 50 preloaded activity modes, more on-watch running data, and side buttons for better control during workouts. It's a big upgrade over the Vivoactive 5, and is a solid option for those who want a robust fitness watch without the bulk. This compact massage gun boasts a convenient, travel-friendly design that remains powerful enough to deliver effective results. We also love its heated head, which we've found to speed up recovery. The Ergatta Lite Rower offers the brand's game-like rowing experience and beautiful design with a smaller footprint and lower price. It's not too late to pivot your wardrobe for the cooler weather, especially with these deals on apparel and accessories. Some of our favorite brands are still offering sales right now, including discounts from SKIMS, Vuori, Allbirds, and more. This modal slip dress's slinky silhouette is designed to hug and accentuate your curves. It has a flattering square neckline. We haven't found Columbia's coats to be perfectly warm when it dips below freezing, but they're well designed nonetheless. This style comes in plus sizes too. It's made with a water-resistant material to keep you dry. This season, brown is the new black. Wear this warm, fuzzy number under a parka for an extra layer of protection from the cold. With this simple sleek dress it’s all about the hidden details, like a built-in bra and ventilated four-way stretch. The Inversion Rib Support Tank adds a sneaky amount of support without losing its cute factor. Available in three colors, the tank features a flattering ribbed material and moisture-wicking properties. This bra gives full‑coverage support with a silky, double‑layered fabric and wide wings to smooth your back and sides. With unlined cups, adjustable straps, and a hidden cushion underwire, it’s comfy enough to wear all day without sacrificing structure. The SKIMS Butt Enhancing Padded Brief adds a little extra lift with built-in padding and light smoothing. It’s soft, stretchy, and designed to stay smooth under clothes. Be the cutest on the court. This exercise skirt features a built in 3” short underneath with discreet pockets. From spin class to the grocery store to lounging around at home, leggings are an essential part of anyone’s routine. The Wunder Under SmoothCover High-Rise Tights does the job well for any of these, plus so much more. We love Spanx AirEssentals for the breathable fabric, stylish cut, and huge variety of color availability. Equal parts cute and cozy, this half-zip pullover has a flattering, roomy drape. The Classic Ultra Mini Snugscape features a mix of suede and shearling with a modern twist. The Wool Runner 2 introduces design tweaks that make the shoe even more comfortable and durable. That includes increased height and width in the sole cushioning, resulting in a higher profile and more comfort. Whether you're in need of new dress shoes or just some casual layers, these sales have you covered. Some of our favorite brands, like The North Face and Naadam, are still offering notable deals. With DryVent waterproof technology, a 550-fill down power rating, and a faux fur hood, The North Face's Explore Farther Parka is well-equipped for winter. A straightforward 5 mm band like this is ideal for someone who wants an understated, comfortable wedding ring that will never feel out of place. The polished 14k yellow gold adds warmth and shine without any extra embellishment. This versatile layering piece works across the seasons with its breathable fabric and ribbed detailing. It's made of Naadam's premium 16-gauge cashmere for an ultra-fine and silky soft fit that you won't want to take off. There’s a tricky balance to strike when it comes to flannel shirts, neither too heavy nor too light for daily wear. This Bonobos shirt lives up to its title, with an Oxford shirt-like build and ultra-soft fabric made for the office and holiday date nights. The comfort of sweats meets the utility of bungee pants in these warm and fleecy pants. Designed to be moisture-wicking, breathable, and two to three times cooler than regular Cotton, the Cool Cotton Boxer Brief is super comfortable. The Nike Pegasus Trail 5 are versatile shoes that provide a smooth ride, whether running on trails or pavement. Made with leather, these UGGs are an elevated take on a classic silhouette. Makeup fans and skincare lovers are in for a treat, since several major brands are still on sale, including items from Urban Decay, Ulta, and Tarte. You can save on everything from skin serum to makeup. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. If you're going to splash out on a tried-and-true serum that is super-effective and that dermatologists swear by, the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic Serum is it. The Laneige Gentle Gel Cleanser is a lightweight formula, as its name would suggest. It contains Blue Hyaluronic Acid for optimal hydration, allantoin to smooth the skin, and an amino-acid complex to support the skin barrier. The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is like a lip balm version of the brand's cult-favorite Water Sleeping Mask. The Tarte Maracuja Lip Plump offers a creamy, smooth-gliding formula similar to a balm or lipstick. It also burns less than other plumpers, with more of a cool, minty-fresh feeling. Your hair deserves better, and with these deals, you can give it just that without breaking the bank. Notably, big-hitters like Dyson and Olaplex are still on sale. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Supersonic Nural is a feature-packed luxury hairdryer with smart personalization and heat protection that make styling faster and easier. It’s lightweight, ergonomically balanced, and far less tiring to use than traditional dryers. If a high-end hair dryer is within your budget, the Nural’s intelligent design and best-in-class features make it worth the splurge. This updated Airwrap adds Bluetooth features for customizing settings, tracking routines, and even automating curls with a single button. It includes several new attachments, like a conical barrel for tight curls, a Wave + Curl diffuser for textured styles, and a Blade concentrator for more controlled airflow. The Amber Silk colorway is exclusive to this year’s limited release. This Blowout Kit from T3 offers fast and gentle styling thanks to the Aire360 technology that channels airflow to thoroughly dry and curl hair safely. Use the cool shot feature to lock in your style for an extra bouncy blowout all day long. Boosted with argan oil and plant protein, this dry shampoo absorbs oil while amping up volume. These deals are packed with savings for your furry friends. Toys, pet food, and cat trees are marked down across the board, and there are even rare discounts on dog DNA tests. JustFoodForDogs offers six gently cooked fresh frozen recipes, four shelf-stable meals, variety packs, and special diets, all backed by industry-leading research. With one swab of your dog's mouth, this test will determine your dog's ancestry and look for common medical complications. The Modkat XL Litter Box gives cats choices with both a top and side entry, and the perforated folding lid helps capture loose litter and allows for easy cleaning. If cost stands in the way of purchasing a cat tree, this $60 model has everything and more your cat needs. This tilt-pan AI camera combines pet-focused tracking and alerts with solid home security features, providing pet parents with flexibility, peace of mind, and reliable performance at an affordable price. With the holidays coming up, there are big discounts on toys, board games, and Lego sets with great picks for giftees of all ages. You can get something for the kids in your life or your inner child. These scooters are durable outdoor toys that feel like a big gift yet they're pretty affordable. Because these scooters also fold up, they are easier to store and take on the go than a bike. As a parent, KiwiCo crates give me peace of mind that I'm providing developmentally appropriate activities for my daughter, and my favorite part is that the Panda Crate comes with a magazine full of additional activity ideas. This tiny plant set from Lego is designed for adults to enjoy assembling and then displaying. They're a fun way to display some greenery without worrying about any maintenance. One of Lego's many sets for adults, this 878-piece set lets you create a bonsai tree to decorate any room, minus the upkeep. It includes pieces to add cherry blossoms. For younger babies, these 30 blocks are a fun way to examine colors and practice hand-eye coordination. As they grow up, they’ll use them to learn their letters and numbers.

More post-Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday fell on Dec. 1 this year, which means it’s officially over, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still deals to be found. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales went live across the biggest retailers. Now that the day is done and dusted, remaining deals are starting to run dry, so time is running out to shop. Almost all major retailers offered discounts for Cyber Monday, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as specialized retailers like B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can run out of stock quickly, so online shopping often gives you the best shot at grabbing what’s left. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and some extended them into Cyber Monday. While the official event is over, a handful of last‑minute bargains are still live today, but they won’t last much longer. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We've rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll continue to highlight the best lingering deals throughout this extended sale period. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive, the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. Cyber Monday is now in the past, leaving the big shopping events of 2025 behind. However, the deals are still flowing like (mulled) wine over at Amazon. There are still many lingering discounts you can take advantage of today.

These Meta Ray Ban glasses don't go on sale often. Currently, the glasses are available at a starting price of $141, depending on the style you choose. These glasses offer UVA and UVB ray protection, enabling video and regular phone calls, as well as integration with Meta AI for capturing photos and videos. This M4 MacBook Air is the latest addition to Apple's most lightweight lineup, and it's our overall favorite laptop that you can buy right now. The basic 256GB model is on sale for $250 off, though it is temporarily out of stock. You can still order it now to lock in the sale price. Just be aware that there may be a shipping delay. Or you can get a model with double the storage, all while still scoring that $250 discount. The 15-inch model is also on sale for those who prefer a larger display. These over-ear Bose headphones are a slight step down from its pricey Ultra's, and they're a steal at 45% off. They still support active noise cancellation and high-fidelity audio, and have an impressive 24-hour battery life. The Apple Watch SE 3 just hit shelves this fall and is the most affordable smartwatch in Apple's lineup.

Enjoy an improved audio experience with Alexa for clearer vocals, deeper bass and vibrant sound in any room. Dyson has often earned spots on our list of best vacuums, and this V8 Plus model is perfect for tackling dust and debris -- and it's now at the lowest price we've seen. Take the hassle out of decorating with Govee’s Christmas Tree Lights at the lowest price we've seen. CNET's James Bricknell is a huge fan of Govee's smart lamps and lights, and this set is perfect for the holidays. This outdoor security camera makes it easy to keep an eye on your home from anywhere.

Plus, the cord swivels so you can lock it in place and keep it out of your way while you're cooking. Cyber Monday 2025 officially took place on Dec. 1, but some deals are still available at Amazon today, giving shoppers extra time to snag savings. A Prime membership isn't required to shop Amazon's lingering Cyber Monday deals, but some discounts are exclusive to Prime members -- particularly on Amazon's own devices. If you're unsure whether Prime is worth it, consider the other benefits you get with a membership, like faster shipping and bundled perks. Like most major retailers, Amazon is offering huge discounts across a wide range of tech, including headphones, TVs, speakers, tablets and more. Outside of Prime Day, Cyber Monday is the best time of year to score big savings on Amazon's own devices like smart speakers, security cameras and streaming gear (though many of these deals are Prime‑exclusive). With many of the top Cyber Monday deals still live on Amazon, now is a great time to upgrade your tech or check off holiday gifts. It's also a great opportunity to pick up holiday decorations or grab outdoor gear for next year, as retailers clear out remaining seasonal inventory. Both events deliver superb offers across categories, but Prime Day leans heavily on Amazon products such as TVs, smart home devices and Prime membership perks. Members get access to far more exclusive discounts during Prime Day. Cyber Monday, on the other hand, casts a wider net. Virtually all product types from all brands see major markdowns, and while there are still Prime‑exclusive offers, they're fewer compared to Prime Day.

Cory Fernandez Commerce Editor Cyber Monday may be over, but Target is still offering notable deals throughout the week. You’ll find sales on tech, smartwatches, beauty, travel and more, but don’t wait to shop — many of them still expire soon.

FedEx is closing a Coppell, Texas facility and permanently laying off 856 employees. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider. This follows other recent FedEx job cuts across North Texas facilities. The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider.

The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The American worker is under siege again, this time in the heart of Texas. In a move that exposes the fragile state of our economy and the disposable view corporations often hold of their workforce, FedEx is shuttering a Coppell logistics facility and laying off 856 employees. The cuts, set to begin in January with the facility closing by April 2026, follow the loss of a major customer to a competitor. This isn't an isolated incident but part of an unsettling pattern of endless job cuts eroding the foundation of the American middle class. FedEx, in its filing with the Texas Workforce Commission, coldly stated the reason: âThis action is necessitated solely by our customerâs decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider.â With that bureaucratic language, nearly 900 livelihoods are deemed expendable. The company noted the closure is âexpected to be permanent.â A pattern of cuts across North Texas The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers. Job review service Glassdoor notes this trend is expected to âstoke worker anxiety as it continues in 2026.â The data is alarming. Layoffs of fewer than 50 people, which made up just 38% of cuts in 2015, now account for 51%. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas observed, âOver the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so itâs surprising to see so many in October.â The brutal timing of these announcements, often just before the holidays, shows an erosion of corporate conscience. The broader landscape is bleak. Major pillars of employment like Amazon, UPS, and Target have announced tens of thousands of job cuts recently. UPS alone has cut about 48,000 jobs this year. Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Why Cyber Monday could break spending records despite economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Deals promoted as some of the best of the holiday season are expected to keep people across the United States glued to their computers and smartphones on Cyber Monday. It’s no secret that buying things online is a staple of many people’s everyday routines. And year after year, those purchases mount during the gift-giving holiday rush. Experts expect consumers to drive record Cyber Monday spending this year, even amid wider economic uncertainty. The firm predicts that buy now, pay later loans will reach a new $1 billion milestone, the vast majority involving purchases made on mobile devices AI-assisted shopping is the talk of the holiday shopping season NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season. They hope to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases still are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Shoppers spend billions on Black Friday to snag holiday deals, despite wider economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year’s holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday — spending billions of dollars both in stores and online. Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. In-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that in-store Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024 — but that's notably better than a decline of 6.2% seen in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Consumers should do their research before giving in to Travel Tuesday temptation NEW YORK (AP) — Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it’s Small Business Saturday. In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday. On the same day as the nonprofit world’s Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency. Trump commutes prison sentence for former private equity executive David Gentile HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of a former investment manager convicted of defrauding investors. It's the latest in a series of clemency actions Trump has taken in white-collar criminal cases. David Gentile had been convicted for his role in what the Justice Department at the time described as a scheme to defraud investors. His firm had raised $1.6 billion to acquire companies. The White House said the firm had disclosed to investors that their capital might go to pay dividends to other investors — undercutting claims that it had engaged in a “Ponzi” scheme in which new investments are used to reimburse previous investors. A lost generation of news consumers? Survey shows how teenagers dislike the news media NEW YORK (AP) — You don't have to tell Cat Murphy or Lily Ogburn about the attitudes of young people toward journalists. The profession hasn't been popular among adults for many years, but a new survey shows the extent to which teens aged 13 to 18 feel the same way; Murphy and Ogburn have seen it for years among their friends who wonder why they want to go into the field. Experts say it's a combination of their surroundings, including the most prominent politician they have known — Donald Trump — who frequently denounces “fake news” — and a lack of understanding of journalism's role in society. Trump says Venezuelan airspace should be viewed as closed. Maduro government slams 'colonial threat' WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The Venezuelan government is accusing President Donald Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty. That charge comes after Trump's social media post Saturday that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety.” His assertion raises more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The White House isn't responding to questions about what Trump meant by his post. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry says “such declarations constitute a hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act.” The Federal Aviation Administration's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. Vote count under way in Honduras to elect new president in a close race after Trump’s intervention TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Poll workers have begun tallying Hondurans’ votes as the country moves to elect a new president only days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced he would pardon a former president. Voting was extended an hour beyond the original closing time in many locations to accommodate remaining voters. No major voting problems were initially reported by electoral authorities. Voters will also elect a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions. Shoppers hit Black Friday sales with celebratory mood despite economic strain NEW YORK (AP) — The economic picture hasn’t looked very rosy. Hiring has been sluggish. Consumers have been hit with soaring meat prices. Layoffs are rippling through companies. But despite those concerns, shoppers were hitting the stores in full strength on Black Friday. They were sipping champagne as they searched for discounts on the day that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more selective with their purchases while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the winter holidays. Venezuelan leader Maduro may seem desperate. But his loyalty vs punishment strategy is hard to crack CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was once critical of English. But he now sings John Lennon’s "Imagine" and promotes peace with his newest catchphrase “No War, Yes Peace.” Venezuela’s opposition says this is a display of desperation. Opposition leaders hoped military threats would weaken Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party's leadership continues to hold despite the U.S. military buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast. The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock. San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce’s director of consumer insights. The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer’s website, Schwartz said. Despite the advancements, AI’s impact on holiday shopping will be “relatively limited” this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner. “The more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,” Jashinsky said. "But customer behavior takes a long time to change.” Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025: AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for “detail-heavy” items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said. Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations. Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans, Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed. “This is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,” Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walmart’s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient. Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal’s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops. This holiday season, shoppers have new options. Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets. Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment's size and color. Microsoft's Copilot also launched a price tracker this year. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive. “A lot of consumers that weren’t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,” Goldberg predicted. Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase. OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx. OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time. A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app. New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, “agentic AI” is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say. Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an “auto buy” button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said. The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a “Shop Direct” button will take them to the website of a place that does. Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a “buy for me” option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers. Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said. Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

Title: PagerDuty Falls to ~$1B Market Cap on $500M ARR. Just 2x ARR. Profitable Isn’t Enough. You Have to Grow.

by Jason Lemkin | 5 Interesting Things, Blog Posts, Scale PagerDuty just reported earnings, and the numbers tell a sobering story. The Captain Obvious lesson and reminder: Growth Remains King. Even if you are profitable. You just have to grow. And for now at least — PagerDuty just isn’t growing anymore. Here’s where they are today: And yet the stock is down 75%+ from its 2021 highs. Down nearly 50% from its IPO price of $38.25 back in 2019. Profitable isn’t enough. You have to grow. PagerDuty has built something real. Almost $500M in ARR. Over 15,000 paying customers. One-third of the Fortune 500. Customers like Cisco, Zoom, Fox, Shopify, and the NYSE. A 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Nearly $550M in cash on the balance sheet. 83%+ gross margins. This is a real business. A profitable business. A business that serves mission-critical use cases — when systems go down at 2am, PagerDuty is the one waking up the right engineer. And the market values it at 2x ARR. Meanwhile, companies still growing 30%+ trade at 10-15x ARR or more or higher. That’s a 5-7x difference in multiple. The lesson: A dollar of ARR growing 30%+ is worth 5-7x more than a dollar of ARR growing 4%. PagerDuty was once a rocketship. At IPO in 2019, they had 139% NRR — truly elite expansion. In 2022, it was still 124-126%. Customers were landing and expanding aggressively. Today? 100% NRR. That single metric tells the whole story. At 100% NRR: Here’s what the metrics trajectory looks like: When your NRR drops from 130%+ to 100%, your growth engine fundamentally breaks. You go from a flywheel to a treadmill. PagerDuty has had roughly 15,000-16,000 paid customers for three years. Essentially flat. Yes, they’ve grown the number of $100K+ customers from 825 to 867. That’s good! But it’s only 5% growth. And the overall customer base isn’t expanding. When your customer count goes flat, it means one of two things: Either way, it signals that finding new customers has gotten very, very hard. Here’s what founders sometimes miss: Profitability is necessary but not sufficient. PagerDuty made all the “right” moves for the 2022-2024 efficiency era: The market shrugged. Why? Because investors aren’t just buying today’s profits — they’re buying future cash flows. And if your ARR is only growing 4%, your future cash flows are capped. The valuation math: The premium multiples go to companies that can compound. 20%+ growth with strong unit economics gets 8-12x ARR. 30%+ gets you 12-18x. 40%+ and you’re looking at 20x+. PagerDuty’s 4% growth puts them in a different category entirely. In July 2025, Reuters reported that PagerDuty is exploring a sale with Qatalyst Partners. This is actually the second time they’ve explored selling — a similar effort in late 2023 didn’t produce an acceptable offer. This tells you everything about where the board’s head is at: The good news? At 2-3x ARR, PagerDuty is actually cheap for what it is. A strategic buyer who could cut costs further, or bundle it with other products, might pay 3-4x+ ARR. That’s a 30-50% premium from here. But for a company that once traded at 15-20x ARR? That’s a painful outcome for long-term shareholders. Here’s what makes PagerDuty’s situation even harder: the competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted against them. Attack from Above: The Platform Giants Are Bundling The biggest threat isn’t another startup — it’s the observability platforms bundling incident management into their offerings. In June 2024, Datadog launched Datadog On-Call, bringing paging and incident management directly into their observability platform. Their pitch is devastating for PagerDuty: why switch between tools when you can have monitoring AND on-call in one platform with shared context? As one analyst noted, Datadog’s On-Call “could directly challenge PagerDuty and Atlassian Opsgenie” by reducing context switching for IT ops teams. ServiceNow is another threat — they generate more than 20x PagerDuty’s revenue and are expected to grow at 21% CAGR. For large enterprises already in the ServiceNow ecosystem for ITSM, adding incident management is a checkbox, not a new vendor decision. Cisco acquired Splunk. Atlassian has OpsGenie. The platform consolidation trend is real, and standalone point solutions like PagerDuty are caught in the squeeze. Attack from Below: Hungry Startups Eating Their Lunch Meanwhile, a new wave of Slack-native incident management startups has emerged: These startups are purpose-built for modern engineering teams. They’re Slack-native (where engineers actually live), more affordable, and laser-focused on the incident response workflow. As one industry survey noted, “PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.” The startups explicitly position against PagerDuty’s complexity and cost. Rootly’s marketing literally says “Migrate from PagerDuty faster than you can write fair pricing.” The Market Has Changed When PagerDuty went public in 2019, they were the clear category leader with 139% NRR. The “incident management” category was theirs. But the market fragmented: PagerDuty tried to expand into AIOps, automation, and business operations to grow the TAM. But as one analyst observed, they “operate in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco’s Splunk and ServiceNow.” The result? A category leader that’s being squeezed from above by bundlers and from below by insurgents — while the core market matures. PagerDuty pioneered on-call incident management. They defined the category. And they won it. But here’s the problem: Categories have natural sizes. The “core” incident management market isn’t infinite. Most companies that need sophisticated on-call rotation and alerting already have a solution. PagerDuty got most of the big ones. They tried to expand the TAM with: But these adjacencies haven’t moved the needle enough. The $36B TAM they cite in investor decks isn’t converting to $36B of real demand for PagerDuty specifically. When you dominate a category but the category stops growing, you have three options: 1. NRR is destiny. When NRR drops below 110%, alarm bells should go off. Below 100%, you’re in serious trouble. Monitor this metric religiously. 2. Customer count growth matters. Flat customer counts for 3 years isn’t a plateau — it’s a warning sign that your market may be saturated or your GTM motion is broken. 3. Profitability buys you time, not valuation. Getting to profitability is essential for survival. But don’t expect the market to reward efficiency alone. You still need growth. 4. Category size is a ceiling. If you’re dominating a $500M category, you’re going to be a ~$500M ARR company. Expanding the category is possible but brutally hard. 5. The “rule of 40” isn’t a multiple accelerator at low growth. 4% growth + 28% margins = 32, which is below 40. But even if it were above 40, a 4% grower trades very differently than a 30% grower with similar efficiency. PagerDuty built a great product. They serve real customers with real pain. They’re profitable and have a fortress balance sheet. And the market values them at 2-3x ARR because growth has stalled. This is the new reality of B2B and SaaS. Profitability is table stakes now. Efficiency is expected. What commands premium multiples is durable growth. If you can’t grow, you can still build a great business. But you won’t build a great stock. And you may end up selling for far less than you once dreamed. Profitable is not enough. You have to grow. Digging into PagerDuty’s Q3 FY26 investor presentation reveals a few more fascinating data points: 1. The Quarter-by-Quarter NRR Collapse is Stark The presentation shows the sequential decline in painful detail: Five straight quarters of decline. That’s not noise — that’s a trend. And it’s not bottoming out; it’s hitting the floor. 2. They Slashed Sales & Marketing from 53% to 30% of Revenue This is the real story behind the margin expansion. In FY20, PagerDuty spent 53% of revenue on sales and marketing. Today? Just 30%. That’s 23 percentage points cut from GTM investment. Yes, it helped margins. But it also helps explain why growth collapsed. You can’t cut your way to growth. 3. R&D Spend Dropped from 26% to 16% Similarly, R&D went from 26% of revenue in FY20 to just 16% today. When you’re being attacked by nimble startups and platform giants, cutting R&D by 10 points feels dangerous. PagerDuty is leaner, but is it still innovating fast enough? 4. They Claim a $50B TAM with Only ~1% Penetration The investor deck cites 87 million potential users across developers (30M), infrastructure ops (23M), customer service (28M), and SecOps (6M) — and claims only ~1% penetration. If true, that’s massive upside. But if you’re only penetrating 1% of a $50B market after 15 years and you’re growing 5%… something doesn’t add up. Either the TAM is overstated or the go-to-market isn’t working. 5. They’ve Tried to Buy Growth — Rundeck (2020), Catalytic (2022), Jeli (2023) The innovation timeline reveals a string of acquisitions: Rundeck for automation in 2020, Catalytic for no-code workflows in 2022, and Jeli for post-incident learning in 2023. These were bets on expanding beyond core incident management. But three years later, growth is still stalling. Acquisitions alone can’t fix a slowing core business — they have to be integrated and monetized. The jury is still out.

Title: Advisors Are Watching These Tax Law Changes in 2026

New tax laws including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act present novel risks and opportunities when filing next year’s tax returns. Jeff Benjamin Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside The holiday season is full of traditions: travel, turkey and occasionally too much eggnog. But for advisors, there’s another (arguably less fun) annual ritual: year-end tax management. Even with about a month left in the calendar year, financial advisors say there are plenty of ways clients can and should prepare for the end of 2025 and the start of 2026. From new guidelines and tax laws related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law in July, to standard tax-loss harvesting strategies, advisors say there is a lot to focus on during the final weeks of the year. “There are some new limitations … going into effect in 2026, which should be considered carefully before yearend,” said Kathy Buchs, Senior Tax Advisor at MAI Capital Management. The One Big Beautiful Bill, which comprehensively reshaped tax legislation and government spending, “created some additional complexities surrounding itemized deductions for 2025 and 2026,” Buchs said. For example, the law reduced deductible charitable contributions by 0.5% of adjusted gross income and reduced the charitable deduction of high-income taxpayers to 35 cents of tax benefit per dollar donated from 37 cents. “Because of these limitations, which go into effect in 2026, many clients are choosing to accelerate their charitable contributions into 2025 to fully benefit from their charitable giving,” Buchs said. “Many of them are also utilizing donor-advised funds to preserve flexibility for future grant-making.” Donor-advised funds act like a personal tax-advantaged investment account dedicated to supporting qualified charities. Patrick Sabol, Senior Lead Planner at Facet, describes charitable contributions as one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax liability. “You can do this by donating cash or appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice or potentially by using a Donor-Advised Fund,” he added. Sabol said one area that can sometimes be overlooked when focusing on more sophisticated strategies is simply maxing out contributions to pre-tax 401(k) and Health Savings Account plans. While charitable deductions will be capped starting next year at a 35% rate, taxpayers are getting some new relief in the area of state and local tax deductions, commonly referred to as SALT. In 2024, the SALT deduction was capped at $10,000, but that has been increased to $40,000 for the tax years 2025 through 2029. The full $40,000 deduction starts phasing out at modified adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 for joint filers, and the SALT deduction drops back to $10,000 when adjusted gross income reaches $600,000, according to John Patterson, Wealth Management Advisor at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “When it comes to year-end planning, there are several key dos and don’ts to keep in mind,” Patterson said. “Any charitable gifts should be finalized before December 31, and if your income has changed significantly this year, review your withholding or make estimated payments now to prevent penalties or surprises at tax time.” Other tax deductions introduced in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include up to $12,500 for qualified overtime pay, up to $6,000 for those 65 and older even if they are taking the standard deduction, and up to $10,000 for interest paid on auto loans for qualified vehicles purchased in 2025. Gabriel Shahin, founder and chief executive of Falcon Wealth, said tax-loss harvesting is among the areas he never overlooks this time of year. “Those losses should be used to offset your ordinary income, not just your capital gains,” he said. “Selling gains to offset losses defeats the whole point of tax-loss harvesting.” Shahin said one mistake he sometimes sees is investors ignoring their taxable brokerage accounts. “That’s where you’re getting hit with taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains,” he explained. “With strategic withdrawals and coordinated Roth contributions, you can shift money into tax-free growth instead of bleeding taxes every year for no reason.” Lance Elrod, co-owner of Next Step Financial Transitions, said tax-loss harvesting should be a focus throughout the year, but always revisited at yearend. “In years like 2025, when there has been strong market performance, especially in certain sectors like tech and international stocks, it’s worth revisiting your overall allocation to make sure you haven’t drifted too far away from where you want your allocation to be,” he said. Feeling Crypto. With a growing focus on cryptocurrency investing, Elrod said that can also be a good place to find tax management opportunities. “The crypto space has had a rough two-month stretch and if you purchased any cryptocurrencies recently, you are likely at a loss,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies are seen as property in the US, you do not have to worry about the wash-sale rule like you would for other investments.” In essence, Elrod explained, “if you feel strongly about your crypto position, you can sell today to capture the loss for tax purposes and repurchase the same position five minutes later and not have to worry about the sale being disallowed for tax purposes.” Make It a Roth. Virtually across the board, advisors say consideration should be given to Roth conversions. “Failing to factor in potential tax-bracket shifts may also cause you to miss valuable opportunities for Roth conversions,” said Patterson of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “Consider Roth conversions to lock in future tax-free growth, but carefully manage conversion amounts to avoid tax-bracket creep,” he added. Sabol of Facet said a Roth conversion is not necessarily a tax minimization strategy in the short term, but it can be a major year-end opportunity that is often overlooked. “Towards the end of the year, we can better estimate what tax bracket we will end up in,” he added. “This is a great time to maximize the lower brackets and fill them up with a conversion if available.” Shahin of Falcon Wealth described Roth conversions as one of the best tools for people in their 70s. “You’re essentially prepaying taxes at today’s lower rates to avoid massive required minimum distributions later when rates go up,” he said. “With tax brackets scheduled to increase in 2026 and SALT relief expiring, real tax planning becomes essential, because you want to shrink that pre-tax balance now, not when your RMDs force the issue.” The world’s largest asset manager is caught in the crossfire between critics who say it’s pushing ESG too aggressively, and those who insist it’s not doing nearly enough. The company, which is still new to the category, sees the case for buffer and defined-outcome ETFs growing as more people near retirement. The CFP Board presented four possible scenarios on how AI will impact wealth managers in the year 2030. The way advisors communicate retirement outcomes can dramatically improve client optimism. PE will continue to dominate, but medium-sized sellers may fill in the gaps. Client risk aversion shifts constantly, and advisors must navigate those changes while technology becomes more prominent in investment management. Financial advisors learn to love the turnkey solutions with customizable options. The most significant benefits went to savers with bigger balances and higher contribution rates. Crypto’s exclusion further highlights the complete 180 Paul Atkins’s SEC has done on multiple issues from the previous administration. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Have you ever wondered how Amazon manages to deliver billions of packages a day across the globe? One center in the UK is already gearing up for the Christmas season, with a highly synchronized operation of moving robots, conveyor belts and storage towers. (AP Video: Mustakim Hasnath) Amazon’s generative AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, appears on a computer monitor, Dec. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone in front of an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT’s Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, file) NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season’s most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock. San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce’s director of consumer insights. The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer’s website, Schwartz said. Despite the advancements, AI’s impact on holiday shopping will be “relatively limited” this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner. “The more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,” Jashinsky said. “But customer behavior takes a long time to change.” Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025: AI’s potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers’ guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user’s previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for “detail-heavy” items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said. Then there’s Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user’s browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations. Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans, Responses are pulled from Google’s 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed. “This is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,” Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walmart’s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target’s app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient. Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal’s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops. This holiday season, shoppers have new options. Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets. Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment’s size and color. Microsoft’s Copilot also launched a price tracker this year. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive. “A lot of consumers that weren’t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,” Goldberg predicted. Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx. OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time. A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app. New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, “agentic AI” is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say. Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an “auto buy” button while setting up price alerts. Once a product’s price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said. The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn’t carry a desired item in its store, a “Shop Direct” button will take them to the website of a place that does. Google’s AI Mode price tracker also includes a “buy for me” option that automatically makes a customer’s purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers. Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google’s program discloses to the store that it’s an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said. Google said it’s applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.
