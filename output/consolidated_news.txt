Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has stated that a growing number of professional investors are skipping Bitcoin and turning directly to Ethereum as their first crypto investment. This has long been regarded as the entry point into digital assets, and Bitcoin is now sharing the spotlight with Ethereum. In Ripdoteth’s update on X, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has revealed on live that an interesting trend is emerging. He claims that many professional investors are bypassing Bitcoin and going directly to Ethereum, whose utility in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and Web3 applications is increasingly drawing institutional capital. The reason he explains is rooted in how institutions already think about portfolio construction. According to the expert, most professional investors don’t actually own gold. This is because Gold is considered a niche asset, with perhaps only 15% to 20% of institutions holding it, while the vast majority of 80% or more invest in stocks and bonds. Since Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, its appeal is limited for many professionals who never allocated to gold in the first place. “A lot of people look at Bitcoin like it’s digital gold. I don’t own gold, but I do own technologies,” Hougan stated. ETH fits naturally into the portfolios of those who already allocate to innovative technologies. With tokenization and stablecoins gaining traction, he expects institutional flow into ETH to continue building momentum. While institutions see Ethereum as the exposure to the technological backbone of a digital economy, Wall Street FOMO has hit historic levels, as the US institutional appetite for ETH is reaching unprecedented heights. Crypto trader Bull Theory has highlighted that in August 2025 alone, Ethereum Spot ETFs purchased $3.87 billion worth of ETH, driven almost entirely by professional investors chasing long-term exposure. Leading the charge is $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which allocated $3.38 billion worth of ETH and $707 million in Bitcoin, highlighting a clear preference for ETH over BTC. This wave of institutional buying pushed Ethereum to new all-time highs in August. Importantly, the majority of these purchases are intended for long-term holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and supporting sustained price momentum. If ETH closes above $4,630, it will mark the highest monthly close since the 2021 bull run. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transaction volumes surged past $320 billion on-chain, reflecting broad engagement across decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, staking continues to attract Wall Street attention, with nearly 36 million ETH, which is 29% of the total circulating supply, now locked in staking contracts. With 3% staking rewards, Ethereum provides institutional investors with a steady dividend, making it more appealing for long-term portfolios.

I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Full Content:
We sit down with Steve Ballmer, the legendary former Microsoft CEO and owner of the LA Clippers, for an epic conversation covering his 34 years at Microsoft. Steve listened to our Microsoft episodes and had some thoughts to share â and boy, did he deliver. Steve takes us point-by-point through the original IBM DOS deal that started everything, how he built Microsoft's enterprise business from scratch, and offers his candid reflections on missing mobile and search. We also cover the story behind âdevelopers, developers, developersâ, the complexities of his relationship with Bill Gates (including a year where they didn't speak), and why he ultimately decided to step down as CEO. Plus, we learn why Steve has held onto his Microsoft stock through it all â giving him arguably the best investment track record in the world over the last 10 years with his net worth growing from $20B to $130B since leaving. And of course, we couldn't resist also talking about his other passion: the Clippers and Intuit Dome. Hit play and get ready to experience the patented Steve Ballmer energy and fun on full display!â Sponsors: Many thanks to our fantastic Summer â25 Season partners: Links: Sponsors: Sponsors: More Acquired:Â Thank you! You're now subscribed to our email list, and will get new episodes when they drop. Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form Transcript: (disclaimer: may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate and/or amusing transcription errors) Ben: David, Steve gave us the signed Clippers jersey with the name Acquired on it. Thereâs only one jersey. What are we going to do about this? David: Should we rock paper scissors for it? You know what? You keep it. Thereâs no Seattle basketball team. Keep it there up north. Ben: All right. Itâll go in the Acquired museum north. David: Great. Ben: Perfect. All right, letâs do it. David: Letâs do it. Ben: Welcome to episode one of the Summer 2025 season of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. Iâm Ben Gilbert. David: Iâm David Rosenthal. Ben: And we are your hosts. Steve Ballmer is, among other things, arguably the very best investor of the last 20 years. It sounds a little funny to frame it that way, but here are the numbers. In 2014 when Steve left Microsoft, his net worth was $20 billion, almost entirely comprised of Microsoft stock. Today, 11 years later, it is a staggering $130 billion according to Forbes. It is incredibly rare to reach this stratospheric level when you are: (a) not the founder of the company, and (b) no longer CEO or even employed by the company. And all of this comes from just one investment decision. Just keep holding substantially all of his Microsoft stock. David: Incredible. We chatted about it with him in the conversation to come. Ben: Now, as most of you know, we did a big two-part Microsoft series last year on the history of the company up through when Steve transitioned the CEO role to Satya Nadella. Steve listened to those episodes and he had some thoughts that he wanted to share with his recollection of how things went down. Things like what made Microsoft so fabulously successful, what his missteps were as CEO. We wanted to share that as a recorded conversation with all of you, so we set up our cameras and our mics at his philanthropy office, Ballmer Group, in Bellevue, Washington, and we pressed record. Weâll go into everything from the misses on mobile, search, social, the huge wins in enterprise and cloud. Steve also reflects on his business lessons learned, he goes into why he stepped down as CEO when he did, and he talks about his relationship with Bill Gates over the years. Of course, we had to talk with him a little bit about the Clippers and the new arena that Steve built and personally owns too. David: Intuit Dome, incredible place. A cathedral of basketball as Steve would put it. Ben: Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, check out our email list. Itâs the only place where we will share a hint of what our next episode will be. Weâll share episode corrections, updates, and little tidbits that we learn from all of you about previous episodes. Come join the Slack to talk about this with us and the whole Acquired community, that is acquired.fm/slack, and the email list is acquired.fm/email. If you want more Acquired between our monthly episodes, check out ACQ2. We just released one with Zach Perret, the co-founder and CEO of Plaid. David: And weâve got some banger ACQ2 episodes coming up. Ben: Yes, we do. Well, as most of you know, we are doing a massive, massive live show at the 6000-seat Radio City Music hall in New York City on July 15th with our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. There are just a few seats left, so get yours before they are gone at acquired.fm/nyc. The lineup for the night is going to be something very special and we cannot wait to see you there. David: And speaking of, just like how we say every company has a story, every company story is powered by payments, and J.P. Morgan payments is a part of so many of their journeys from seed to IPO and beyond. Ben: So with that, this show is not investment advice, David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. Onto our conversation with Steve Ballmer. Well, Steve, first of all, I noticed you prepared some printed materials here for us. Listeners should know, we didnât ask for this in any way, but at 10:00 PM last night, you sent us a PowerPoint deck and said, I made you some slides. Sorry it got here so late. David and I are looking at each other like we didnât ask you to prepare for this. Thank you for the materials. Steve: Oh, itâs just some stuff that Iâve used with thoughts about how businesses work. I think of this as a time to reflect on things Iâve learned primarily at Microsoft, but also the Clippers about business. I figured, eh, Iâll send them to you. And theyâre PowerPoint. Ben: You mixed a few different templates. Steve: Promotional opportunity. David: Yeah, yeah. Ben: Always a cheerleader. David: Always. Steve: There you go. David: I think the word cheerleader is actually in the PowerPoint deck. Ben: Yes, great. David: Well, Steve, speaking of reflecting, we sit here today, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world, almost $3.5 trillion in market cap. I think everybody would agree itâs an enterprise company, and thatâs largely thanks to you. Ben: Itâs reasonable to call you the founder of Microsoftâs enterprise business. That is not a narrative that is often discussed. We wanted to ask you, how do you feel about the fact that it basically defines the business today? Steve: Interesting. Very kind. Fathering something, I feel good about that. I think thereâs a lot of truth to that. Of course, there are many fathers to the enterprise business at Microsoft, and I feel both good and bad about it. The truth is, Microsoft started out as a consumer company. We built a very important consumer business. That success translated into the opening to go build an enterprise business. One of my regrets is we lost the consumer muscle along the way. I think the ability to be ultra, ultra. Weâre a great company. Microsoftâs a great company. But to have both of those muscles totally firing, if Iâd been able to sustain that consumer muscle, and I had some ideas about why that didnât happen, but the enterprise muscle, muy macho. It got very big and very strong. So Iâm very proud of that. Itâs also funny when you say consumer and enterprise. What does it mean really to say enterprise? Sometimes it can sound just like backend stuff. The truth of the matter is, Microsoft Office/M365, whatever exactly itâs called today, is super important. It was the foundation for having permission to be in the enterprise, and yet itâs a product that sits right there in front of users. The question is, do you think about users or consumer, and do you think about enterprise or do you think about IT? And then there are developers that span both. Thatâs my mental model. You have products that appeal to consumers that IT can handle, and a platform that lets developers build around those and based around those, whether theyâre building for users, users and IT, or in some instances just for IT people, because there are a lot of tools that are just for IT people. Ben: Well, to contextualize all this, we want to go back almost all the way to the beginning, right around the time you joined Microsoft, and talk about Microsoftâs relationship with IBM. Before the IBM PC and before DOS, can you catch listeners up who werenât around at that time, what was IBM in that era? David: I think you called it to us, and when we were talking to you for research, the sun, the moon, and the stars. Steve: Yeah, I did, I think. Well, itâs 1980 when I got here. The company started obviously in 1975. There were IBM computers and a couple of others. But literally, people would say thereâs IBM and the bunch. The bunch was Burroughsâ UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell. But they were just the bunch. IBM did the mainframe, and it did the software, and it did the service. It did everything in computing. Everything. Everything. Then you had this little upstart try again called Digital Equipment, very important in our story because Dave Cutler, who was the father of Windows NT, came from Digital Equipment. They were fighting, they were scrappy, they were mini computers, so smaller than a room, but definitely bigger than a PC, if you will. All the initial Microsoft software was developed actually on DEC computers. Digital Equipment equals DEC, and DEC had a nice business, but it was a lot smaller than IBM. If IBM breathed, that was the direction the computer industry would go. IBM was the subject of an antitrust lawsuit, shockingly in 1969, that didnât actually get settled (I think) to shortly after I got here in the term of Reagan. So 11 years theyâd been living because they were that big and bad and mighty. Ben: And what was the result of that antitrust action? What did they have to do? Steve: I donât remember. It may be when they had to unbundle. In fact, I think it was when they had to unbundle the operating system from the mainframe hardware, so people could build IBM-compatible mainframes. Then one day, shortly after I got here, some guys from IBM call and they say, hey, can we come see you? Youâre going to have to sign an agreement that says you can use nothing we tell you, anything you tell us we can use. These guys showed up, and they told us after we signed their agreement that they wanted to build a PC. They were hoping to get the operating system and some of our language software for it. David: And they were coming to you for the language software? Steve: No, they came to us for the operating system. Now why, youâd say. We werenât in the operating system business. We had a card called the CP/M SoftCard or the SoftCard for the Apple II. It was a card that plugged into an Apple II, that ran CP/M, not our operating system. David: Gary Kildall. Steve: Gary Kildall, Digital Research was the name of the company, but we had licensed it to put on this card that plugged in the Apple II. Somehow, IBM thought they could license CP/M. Even though it wasnât our product, they thought they could license it from us. We said, no, no, no, but you can license our language software. But thereâre these guys down in Pacific Grove, California. Bill called Gary Kildall and said, there are some guys, they want to talk to you, theyâre important. Gary went down there and didnât sign the non-disclosure agreement. In the meantime, there was a company here in Seattle called Seattle Computer Products that had a little CP/M clone. Ben: So the licensing of Microsoft DOS, which didnât even exist when IBM approached you about licensing some things, is the single greatest business deal in history. The licensing of that softwareâ David: We made that contention on our episodes. Ben: Well, I just think you look $3.5 trillion later at Microsoftâs market cap. This kickstarted it all. Steve: It was pretty good. Literally good. There was a company that happened to be here in town, Paul Allen and I went down there, and we met with the founder who later came to work in Microsoft, a guy named Tim Patterson. I think we paid $45,000 or $49,000 for this operating system, because we told IBM no, no. We can take care of it. There was a famous meeting amongst me, Paul, Bill, and this guy Kazuhiko Nishi, who ran our affiliate in Japan, where we were talking about this. There was a lot of, letâs just say, four letter words thrown around. Screw them. Screw them is five letters, but you get the drift. Screw them. Letâs just go get this operating system. Screw them. We can do this. Letâs go. That was the theme. David: Kazu was a cowboy. Steve: He was, yeah. Nishi, absolutely a cowboy. So we sold it to him, half of what we paid for it. We said, we can do this 10â20 times. Twenty times $21,000, $400,000 against $50,000 we paid for it. Pretty good deal. It was a little better than that as you said. David: Talk us through the structure and how you guys thought about this. Because you did not make a lot of money directly from this deal. Steve: Nope, we did not. Remember, the key thing was we didnât charge for the operating system on an ongoing basis. We charged for it one time. If you got a new version, we charged another time. We did the same thing for BASIC and everything else, because at the time you could think we were like a substitute for an R&D department, which means we were fixed price. It was only (I donât know) four or five years later that we actually switched to licensing per unit as opposed to just fixed feeâhere it is, pay us once, and weâre done. David: But the ultimate thing that you guys negotiated was a non-exclusive deal. You could sell this operating system and your language interpreters, but also mainly the operating system to other manufacturers. This is IBM weâre talking about here. How on earth did youâ Steve: But IBM wanted this. IBM were experimenting with a different approach. They had said, look. Instead of us building everything all custom, we want to use some industry standard parts, components because thatâll let us be more agile, et cetera. They didnât come in, loath to any of this. They knew that was our business. They know that was Digital Researchâs business. They wanted to use an Intel part versus their own proprietary part. They didnât ask Intel to do them a custom part either. The notion was, weâll move fast. Weâll get away from the IBM bureaucracy by taking this approach. I wouldnât say that was the hardest convincing, if you will in the story. Ben: But what ended up happening after all these yearsâI imagine it only took a few years to see it play outâwas IBM sold a ton of IBM PCs, and DOS was the operation system, and then everybody else adopted DOS because all the application makers, all the software vendors were targeting DOS as the platform. So Microsoft accrued a huge amount of benefit. Steve: You became the point of integration. Ben: Yeah, and the old world IBM wouldâve accrued that platform benefit. Did they see theâ Steve: Well they were selling a lot of computers and making profit also. They wouldâve been making more profit than we were at the time just the way pricing worked. There was a little twisty in here though I should throw at you if youâre curious. These things had something called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which was the lowest, lowest layer firmware, first level software built into the hardware. IBM had its own BIOS, and some applications became BIOS-dependent. Then the question is, who was going to do an IBM-compatible BIOS? We werenât going to get into that game. We didnât want to have that intellectual property, other arguments, but there were people then, that was important. David: Compaq ultimately became the big company. Steve: Compaq became the big company. I donât remember whether they wrote their own IBM-compatible BIOS, but they were the first one to be IBM-compatible. There were plenty of people who ran MS-DOS who were actually not IBM-compatible because they didnât do a compatible BIOS. Ben: I see. IBM thought, oh weâve got some protection from Microsoft, disintermediating us from all the developers and all the potential customers, because targeting our BIOS is going to be important and unreplicable. Steve: The one thing you have to remember is we live in the modern world now. When you say all the developers, that wasnât a long list. Remember, there was no software industry to speak of when we got started. David: This is the creation of the software industry. Steve: There were a couple of software companies that made packages for IBM mainframes, but almost everything was custom. Really, I would say weâfew other companies, but I would say weâdefined what a modern software business looked like. The notion that there could be lots of developers and yeah, there were some, but itâs not like we think today. There were developers doing lots of standard applications. No. There was no licensing model, no business model. Nothing. VisiCalc was around. Ben: So it wouldâve been counterintuitive or required too many mental hops to think, weâre IBM. Wait, are we giving away the future by allowing someone to distribute a wide operating system that ends up being the target that everyone standardizes on? Which eventually created all of modern Microsoft. Steve: Exactly. You canât blame them because there was nothing to build off of, but yeah. One of the things my little PowerPoint here says is luck is important in the creation of great companies. It is. A lot of people always say weâre masters of the universe. We figure everything out. We never have any luck. Itâs because weâre so talented. Sure, theyâre talented people and hardworking people. But most people have a little luck in their story, and this was our big luck. David: Clearly, but when you were negotiating this, signing it, and then those first couple of years before the clone market really took off, did you think that this could happen? Steve: No. I canât remember what year it wouldâve been, but Andy Grove who was running Intel at the time said, yeah, pretty soon weâll be selling 100 million PCs a year. I donât know. Sometime in the 80s. I think it might have even been in the 90s. Bill and I laughed and said, ah, thatâs not going to happen. We invested big time and if it did happen, we said thatâs great, weâre not going to underinvest. But we thought, ah, heâs crazy. This market will never grow like that. I would say we classically underforecast, that was our tendency. Ben: So the deal gets signed with IBM, you end up shipping DOS, it goes on the IBM PC, itâs selling like gangbusters. When did you start to realize, whoa, what we have here is actually leverage over the ecosystem. We actually are becoming the important layer that ties this whole computing world together with the operating system? David: The personal computing layer. Steve: Oh, I think by the mid- to late-80s. You make it sound very strong. No, we didnât feel very strong. There was IBM man. IBM was still the sun, the moon, and the stars. That didnât change. I would say we didnât drop that theory well. Well, into the 2000s. Into the 2000s, Lotus Notes was coming for us, and that was mid-90s and and beyond. But maybe you could say late, but we werenât an enterprise company. If you looked at the enterprise, the enterprise was stillâ¦ David: IBM. Steve: IBM. We used to say we had to hang on to IBM, that if we ever let go they might trample us. We called them the bear. David: Itâs called this riding the bear, yeah. Steve: Ride the bear. You had to stay on. Then of course graphical user interface. Itâs coming out of Xerox Park at the time, Appleâs doing their thing, and thatâs another disruption, could blow everything up. I would say no sense of confidence about controlling the ecosystem well into the 90s before I think any of that, or at least for me. Ben: When did you start to feel like weâre getting out from under the thumb of IBM? And maybe walk us through a little bit the OS/2-Windows world. Steve: Weâve been staying with IBM, they decided they wanted to build something that was sort of their operating system and sort of not. This is 1982â1983. We and they would collectively build part of it. We would be able to license it to others. They would build a value add layer that was a database and a 3270 emulator. Crazy, just saying now. We were going to work on the operating system and what was called Presentation Manager, called that the graphical user interface, and they were going to have rights equivalent to ownership in the code we wrote. Ben: This sounds so convoluted. Steve: It was so convoluted. Man, there was a time when I made 16 trips to the East Coast in 16 weeks, most of them to South Florida, a couple of them to New York, leave on the red-eye, the Delta DASH flight at around 11:00 PM, get into Atlanta around 5:00 AM, get the flight to West Palm Beach at about 7:00 AM, get in and be able to be at a meeting at 9:00 AM at IBM, and then work all day, catch the 7:00 PM flight home, be here about 10:30 PM or 11:00 PM. Twenty-four hours, down and back. If youâre building something together, remember thereâs no real email at the time. We were literally shipping disks back and forth. And then they decided they were going to do the Presentation Manager piece in England. There were also then a lot of flights to England. And then Texas is where the database and communication [...]. David: This sounds so IBM. Ben: This sounds like Boeing. Steve: It was the joint development agreement. It was the price of staying involved with IBM, and it was convoluted. For speed of action, we kept going on Windows, which we had started. David: For listeners, everything weâre talking about is OS/2, the operating system that basically never comes to. Steve: OS/2 and there was OS/2 Extended Edition or something, which it had their edition. David: And Windows was your Plan B. It was like your side. Steve: No, Windows was our plan. They wanted to do this new operating system. We convinced them, you got to have a graphical user interface. We tried to sell them Windows and they were resisting. Ben: Okay, so it almost seems like youâre humoring IBM at this point with yeah, letâs do OS/2 together. We really think the futureâs Windows. Steve: Humor. Ben: Itâs more than lip service. Steve: My job was managing (by then) system software. Iâd shipped when Iâd been the development manager for Windows 1.0. David: Oh, the great videos of you from the Windows 1.0 launch are so good. Steve: But no, thatâs the sales side. I actually managed the engineers because the guy who was doing it wasnât being successful, and we had to ship the thing. Thatâs when I learned some about engineering management from the engineers, basically, had to teach me to be effective. Weâre trying to keep with OS/2, Billâs very frustrated with IBM. Iâm frustrated, but I know my job is to ride the bear. Billâs pushing Windows hard, but we still suspected OS/2 could be the winner because it came from IBM. But we couldnât just stop for three or four years. We couldnât make the mistake we made in the thing that became Vista. We kept going with Windows, we kept going with OS/2, and then May 1990, they come along and shoot us. I was out running with my wife. I stopped. David: Wait, IBM shot you? Steve: Yeah, they divorced us. They threw us out. David: I thought the story was Windows was gathering strength, and you all thought maybe we can step out from the little brother. Steve: No. David: They came after you? Steve: They had a new leader by then, a guy named Jim Cannavino. He was getting frustrated with us because we were still selling Windows. We were still promoting Windows. This was our first antitrust problem. I donât know if you guys know this. The FTC at the time thought we and IBM were working to divide the market because we had done some positioningâwhatâs Windows good for, whatâs OS/2 good for. We and IBM had done that, and then they said, no, you guys are colluding. Thatâs when we first got attention from antitrust authority. Ben: This is even before the per processor licensing issue. Steve: Yeah. That came later. That came with the DOJ. This was an FTC case and they started it in (I think) 1990, maybe 1989, as we were getting our divorce. My wife and I were remodeling our house. We were living in a condo. We stopped on a run, used a restroom or something. I pick up the Wall Street Journal and I read that IBMâs divorcing us. David: All right. Listeners, now is a great time to thank our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. You almost certainly have seen Steveâs famous 1999 âdevelopers, developers, developersâ chant, which we will talk about with him later in the episode. The ethos, though, of focusing on developers was valid when he said it in 1999 and still holds true today. Like Steve, J.P. Morgan Payments recognizes that supporting developers is a long-term investment. Weâve talked about the $17 billion that J.P. Morgan invests in technology and R&D, and for payments. That means dedicated teams focused on making developersâ lives easier. Ben: Last year, we discussed J.P. Morgan payments developer portal. At a high level, their platform essentially empowers developers to operate securely while abstracting away the complexities of global payments. If you look at the suite of tools available on that platform, the takeaway is J.P. Morgan has continued to roll out more and more technical solutions to effectively accept, manage, and send payments on a global scale. Their APIs come with all the technical documentation youâd expect with detailed testing guides and explaining payments concepts to build your application as you scale your business. David: Letâs say you work at (say) an e-commerce company, for example. You need to restock your products, but your vendor is based in another country. Before any transaction happens, youâd want to use the validation services API to verify account ownership, and ensure that your payment is directed to the correct vendor. Then youâve got to pay them in their local currency and you donât have time to evaluate multiple solutions and stitch together various APIs. So J.P. Morganâs single global payments API can help you take care of all that, including multiple payment rails and methods easily. Ben: And thatâs just one use case. Developers across industries traditionally had to choose between the innovation and flexibility of a FinTech, and the security and scale of a global bank. J.P. Morgan Payments is on a mission to eliminate that choice and offer you both. If youâre a developer working within a FinTech or looking to embed payments within your software, head on over to jpmorgan.com/acquired to learn more about their ever-growing list of APIs. If any listeners remember the meetup that we did after our Chase Center show, weâre actually going to do it again. Weâre planning another meetup the day after Radio City on the 16th. We will share more details soon in the Slack community, but wanted to give folks a heads up in case you were planning for travel, evening of July 16th. A great meetup with our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. Steve: I pick up the Wall Street Journal and they read that IBMâs divorcing us. Ben: What does that mean? Walking away from OS/2 collaboration? Steve: Yes. David: Basically they kick you out, kick Microsoft out, said weâre taking OS/2 in-house. Steve: Exactly. Ben: So youâre sitting there. Windows isnât powerful Windows yet. Windows is this fledgling idea. Steve: We still had something called the 640K barrier. You couldnât speak to more than 640K of memory. We didnât break the 640K barrier until (I think) Windows 3.1, which I want to say was 1991 or 1992. Ben: So youâre on this run, you see IBM is divorcing us. You donât really have confidence in Windows yet. What are you feeling and what do you think the pass is possible? Steve: Mr. Wizard. Whoa. Shoot. Oh my God. We were so, you could say energized if you like. Scared also works. Itâs like, oh my God. Now we have to confront the bear. David: Youâre already a billion-dollar-business at this point. You end 1992 at $2.8 billion in revenue. Steve: Now IBM, but still. David: But youâre still a pipsqueak. Steve: Weâre still pipsqueak to IBM. And remember, we have no enterprise presence. IBM has all dominant enterprise presence. Ben: Whoâs using Windows and how are you selling to them at this point? Steve: Interesting. Single copies. Some hobbyists and end users. Somebody who says, hey, I really want to use a spreadsheet. And a lot of users in enterprises. It wasnât going through IT. Youâd have a user that would buy a PC on the expense account, probably for the department, buy a copy of Windows, buy a copy of Excel, at an Egghead Softwareâwas a software retailer at the timeâbring them in and use them. Then IT started to get nervous about that. We knew most of the copies, not most, but many of the copies were winding up in businesses. What the hell? IBMâs going to stomp us like a bug. David: Given an assumption that if IBM wants to stomp out this happening, itâs going to happen. If we want a future, we got to play with them. Steve: Yeah. Thatâs why we were âriding the bearâ the whole time because theyâd stomp us out and they divorce us in 1990. Then we say, oh my God. David: So at this point, your business, even though itâs a billion-plus scale, itâs selling to retailers to sell copies of softwareâDOS, Windows, languages, apps. Steve: Not DOS. DOS was always sold toâ¦ David: OEM? Steve: Yeah. Not always, but so much the lionâs share, itâs worth saying it, was only sold because you needed a BIOS, remember? You needed a BIOS, so you had to have the hardware vendor build the BIOS into the machine basically. David: So youâve got that. The OEM business, which was alreadyâ Steve: The OEM business was the biggest part of the business. Then we had this retail business, and there was no notion of enterprise licensing. David: Youâve got no CIO relationships, no enterprise agreement. Steve: We had a couple of CIO relationships. The Air Force was the first big Windows customer. Ben: Your first enterprise customer was government? Steve: Our first big Windows customer, at least as I remember it, was the US Air Force, and they were buying single copies of Windows. When you say government, there are really two governments in this country. Thereâs government and thereâs the military. The military is a much more disciplined, advanced user of IT. Theyâre just better. Theyâre more professionally run than most parts of government. So yeah, it was the Air Force. David: Youâve got a little bit, butâ¦ Steve: Yeah, we had one or two customers just to prove we could actually serve big customers. David: As we understand it, you had this realization at this point. Once the divorce happens, well Iâm going to go figure out how to do what IBM does. You personally. Ben: To put a finer point on it, the thing that we said on our episode, and Iâm curious if itâs true or not, is this was not Billâs passion area, and you raised your hand and said, Iâll go figure out enterprise sales. Steve: Oh yeah. Thatâs for sure true. Bill had passions a lot of places, but heâd say the apps group and what Windows could deliver to the apps quite appropriately, Iâd say thatâs where a lot of Billâs brain cycles went. I had also hired Dave Cutler. Dave Cutler had been the architect of the VMS Operating System for Digital Equipment, we had DOS and Windows, and when we were talking to Cutler about coming here, he says, I donât want to work any toy operating systems. I had to say to Dave, good thing, because we have a toy operating system. But Dave is the key to getting us there. We said, look. You got to build an operating system whose API looks like Windows and whose user interface looks like Windows. Ben: So developers are can be familiar with it and write apps for it. Steve: Yeah. You might make some changes because you have to, but itâs got to be a robust operating system. Itâs got to have a secure kernel. Itâs got to have all of these things. Ben: The product set that you had wasnât really enterprise grade yet. Steve: No, we had a joint development agreement, a joint agreement on LAN manager with a company called 3Com. It wasnât all our stuff. We had a development agreement with a company called Sybase to do the SQL database, because we were trying to figure out all these pieces IBM would have, and we didnât have any of that. Ben: An operating system alone is not going to do it. You need all these other components. Steve: And you want to have backend infrastructure. We started scrambling on that in the 80s. We had all these infrastructure pieces that we had to build if we wanted to sell to (Iâll say) business customers. When you say enterprises, sometimes people think very large companies, but we couldnât sell to companies of 20 people without some of this stuff, or 50 people. David: You talk a lot now about this management concept of building muscle. Is this where this came from of you should always be, you used the phrase in the weight room, building muscle ahead of what you need. Were you and Bill thinking this way in the 80s of, hey, we need to be building up this muscle across all parts of computing and business computing? Steve: Well, Paul Allen, Paulâs the key. Paul is the one who said Bill said weâre never going to be a hardware company. When the Altair came out, the first real microprocessor-based computer, Paul says, okay, letâs write all the software that these things will ever need. Bill and I had a lot of the execution around that, but that was the push. Paul was cracking on me in the early 80s to start building an apps group. Come on, Steve. Come on, Steve. Ben: Itâs not just systems. We need to have applications also. Any code that executes on a microprocessor, we should have a player in that market. Steve: And there was a VisiCalc spreadsheet. Come on, Steve, Word Processor. Come on, come on, come on. Letâs get the talent. Letâs get going. We were doing mostly college hiring at the time, so okay. Then we met this guy Simonyi, whoâd been at Xerox PARC. Ben: Charles Simonyi. Steve: Charles Simonyi, exactly. We met him through a mutual friend at 3Com corporation whoâd been at PARC, and he really was the first leader of the apps business. But we licensed. We worked with other people the way IBM worked with us. We went to Sybase and 3Com and letâs work together. It wasnât exactly a JDA (joint development agreement), but we worked with those guys. The analogy now is a little bit Microsoft working with OpenAI. When the big company works with the new company, how does that all play out over time? But I took over system software in 1984, so thatâs when weâre starting all this stuff. You could say I was a little bit more enterprisey. Ben: Iâm looking at your chart here that you made for us. Youâve got 1992â1998 titled lift-off, and thatâs after the era where you talk about enterprise start. David: And you have your role switching from your role as OS division in the previous era to sales. Steve: The lift-off there though is mostly on Windows and applications. The lift-off isnât really enterprise. It was not until the late-2000s. People would say that you guys might find this funny or maybe you even know it. Customers say youâre not an enterprise company. Youâre not an enterprise company. Ben: As late as when? Steve: Oh, late 2000s. Ben: Really? Steve: Absolutely. Youâre not enterprise-grade, youâre not enterprise-ready. Oh, I heard that so much. Ben: And in 2005. Steve: You had Oracle out there. Remember, there were still mainframes and mini computers. Those things were enterprise-ready. IBM had product, still. You didnât have enterprise support. Our licensing, we had to evolve in the early 90s and then again in the late 90s. No, we didnât have those things. So no, we werenât an enterprise software company. Ben: Thatâs so interesting. Steve: Until it was late 2000s. Certainly, it wasnât before 2005. It wasnât at the beginning of my tenure. We were still trying to prove that we were an enterprise company. Now, I just find it cuckoo that all Microsoft is characterized as an enterprise company, which Iâm not. I think itâs more complicated than that, but Iâm not going to say that thatâs not the primary muscle. For sure it is, but me, the company, I was hell bent and determined to prove we were an enterprise company. Ben: Why was that? Letâs call it 1992, 1993, 1994. Why did you feel itâs so important for us to attack that market? Steve: Easy. Because thatâs where IBM could squish us like a bug. If we couldnât sell our stuff to businesses, only to consumers, we knew that by then weâd only get so far because enterprises wanted some features. Enterprise donât like, okay you can go to computer land and buy a few copies. David: And the consumer market, weâre pre-mobile. So pre-mobile, the consumer market, pre-internet, itâs big, but itâs nowhere near IBMâs market in the enterprise market. Steve: By revenue. No, for sure not. Ben: Weâve talked a lot about the products. Letâs talk about the go-to market motion and this invention of the enterprise agreement. What are the key pillars that you came up with for the enterprise agreement and why did they exist? Steve: Our first software pricing packaging model for the enterprise was not the enterprise agreement. First it was we sold you disks. Second, we came up with this notion of what we called select licensing. You could make your own copies. You just report how many copies you sold. David: Sounds rife with challenges here. Steve: You tell us how many copies, and just pay us what you did. David: The enterprise honor system. Ben: Astonishing. And thatâs of Windows, thatâs of Office. Steve: Windows, typically, by then, came with the hardware. Ben: You were mostly using the OEM channel. Steve: For Windows? Yeah. Even to this day, upgrades and stuff are sold direct to enterprises, but basic computer that comes to an enterprise would have the operating system license to the OEM. We were on, you can call it the honor system, but we just couldnât make people buy disks from us or CDs. Enterprises didnât like that, so we had this thing called select. Select had two problems with it. Number one, very hard to copies of software you print. And number two problem, we were selling upgrades and new licenses. Upgrades were less than half the price of new licenses. What does that mean? The company was headed to a world where its revenue was half of its existing revenue. Ben: Unless youâre growing new customers, new logos, a phenomenal clip. Steve: So it was a real problem-looking thing. Bill and I, weâd always dream of this thing where you get some recurring revenue, and then we came up to say, okay, well why donât we just do a license that you didnât have to count the number of licenses you printed? Just the number of computers. Made life simpler. We said, instead of doing sell you a new license and then God knows when we would sell you another upgrade or whatever, weâll do something that just says, hey look. You sign up for three years, you pay us per machine, and you just pay us the same amount of money each year for three years. It let us jimmy-up the price of the upgrade. We solved the upgrade price problem, and we solved the difficulty of administration problem. And that was the enterprise agreement. David: Was it from the beginning of you get everything? Steve: No, that was a special enterprise agreement. You got all the upgrades during that three year period to the products you licensed. David: But you were still picking and choosing, oh I want Excel. Oh I want Server. Steve: You could. We were encouraging you to buy Office. But we also had this all-you-can-eat license. I canât remember what we called that, but basically then I think you counted the number of employees and you could use any of our software for anybody. We just tried to go simpler and simpler and simpler in the administration. Recurring revenue that didnât decline over time. As much as you wanted to eat, the upgrades, everything. We did want essentially what we have now, which is a recurring services business. But we didnât have the cloud. We werenât delivering things. But weâre already on that path. I think we started the Energizer. You guys mentioned what we do with Energizer, which is where we wanted to run their IT department. Ben: They were a pilot customer for this concept. Steve: Yeah, they were the first customer. I talked them into it. This is beyond the enterprise agreement. This is where we actually want to run their stuff because we did want to get to this recurring revenue thing. Ben: And David was referring to this concept earlier. We talked about it a lot in our Microsoft episode and then on our Epic episode. This genius idea of you will get included in your license, a whole bunch of software, even if youâre not ready to use it yet. If at any point youâre considering buying this different software package from this other vendor who just make this one thing, then they look in their paperwork and theyâre like, oh wait, actually we get that from Microsoft for free as a part of the thing weâre already doing. Letâs just do that. As long as youâre developing a lot of software every year, you can indefinitely just make more and more and more stuff so that your customers donât need to look elsewhere as they expand their software needs. How did that come about? Steve: Letâs start with Office. When weâre selling Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and then we put these things together, people would complain. We didnât always sell Office because people say our users donât use Excel. We donât want Excel included. Okay, we had a licensing option for you. But it became easier and easier. People then departments. Departments always, were in-running IT at the time. Still now, I think. We did sell you things that you might not be using. But it also, if youâre trying the departments, we already got it all for you. You may want something different than this department, but we got it all for you. That was an attractive thing for people. Thereâs an insurance aspect that I learned that IT people really want. They want peace of mind. Thatâs part of what it means to be an enterprise. I want to make sure everythingâs secure. I want to make sure that everything is well-managed. I want to make sure everything is well paid for. I want to make sure thereâs somebody to call if things go wrong. I want to make sure I bought everything. I donât want to look bad because either I paid too much or I have holes in what I bought for people. I view this, and I probably evolved my view to this over time, when you sell the enterprise, you have to provide peace of mind, which is like an insurance policy. Buying more than you might be using or some users are using. Itâs an insurance policy. Ben: And software has zero marginal cost and zero distribution cost. So weâre happy to mail you a few more discs if you need them. Steve: But we werenât even mailing discs by then, because we had the enterprise agreement in place. David: At a certain point along the way, you get to, well I want to say the holy trinity, but I think there are more than three pieces of this. But the real killer suite in enterprises, which is Windows, Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange, Office, and all of these pieces of software, all work in orchestration to run your enterprise. Your users, they do their email on Outlook, which is part of Office which runs on Windows, which uses Exchange, which uses Active Directory, which is aâ Ben: SQL server. David: All these things. How long did it take to get to that point? To my mind, thatâs when the enterprise is firing on all cylinders here. Steve: That really comes with email boom. Email boom is late 90s/beginning of 2000s. Ben: Because email is the cart that pulled the whole thing. Steve: Oh yeah. No, itâs the locomotive. Ben: Enterprises wanted email. Steve: Yeah. When Accenture became a company, we started a joint venture called Avanade to help do essentially the holy trinity to help install. We needed support infrastructure and partners who knew how to set up the servers, provision email, put all that in. We needed partners and we didnât have enough capacity. Thatâs why we started this thing, Avanade, which is big, big company at this stage, with Accenture, and that was in the 2000s. I went on the board of Accenture. Ben: But all this to say, the way you could pitch an enterprise is rather than any of these other value propositionsâDavid listed off a whole bunch of softwareâyou could say you guys want some email. We have the most reliable, robust way for your enterprise to adopt email, and itâs going to come with all this other great stuff. Steve: And everything was nicely integrated because remember, you needed Active Directory to manage file shares, to manage printers. It was used for a lot of different things. It really did all come together as the integrated proposition. You guys made fun of the notion that we called all that stuff the BackOffice as if that was [...]. No, no, no. Itâs so wrong. So wrong about that. David: We took that as a signal that Bill just didnât care about this stuff. Steve: Oh, completely not right. I wanted to call it the BackOffice because you needed to buy the Office in the BackOffice. The user, the consumer saw the Office and the BackOffice were the things that were in the server rooms/data centers. But a lot of them were server rooms. Itâs the same thing these days. but cloudized. Ben: All right. As we were preparing for this, there are a bunch of big questions that we just desperately want your take on. A big one is around one of your most iconic moments. 1999, the developers, developers, developers speech. Iâve probably watched this clip 20â30 times, almost everyone listening has seen this clip. What is missing from this clip is all the context around Microsoft and whatâs going on in the world at this time, and what you need to accomplish as a leader of this company. Help us set that stage and then understand why you went on stage that way. Steve: Well remember, by this time weâre not through our IBM competition, and we got Linux competition now on the docket because Linux is competing with Windows Server. Linux is competing with Windows, and thereâs a thing called OpenOffice, open source software for office thatâs competing with Office. We have all these things going on. We havenât beat Lotus Notes yet. David: And youâve got antitrust count. Steve: We have antitrust issues (of course) by then. Ben: The culmination of the DOJ suit is happening within 12 months of this moment. Steve: Correct. But itâs clear in all these competitions, the thing you need are third-parties that reinforce what youâve gotâadd value around what youâve got. I could say run on your platform, but Iâll come to that later if you want to what a platform is and isnât, if you want to do that. Itâs interesting, I think. Ben: Yeah, letâs do it. Steve: Particularly since everythingâs called a platform these days. But anyway. Ben: Letâs take an aside here. Give us your definition of a platform. Steve: You could call it anything that is extensible, and itâs the extensibility that âmakes it a platform,â because youâre going to get people to extend the value you add. The question and the reason thatâs important is that applications are platforms too. Not just developer platforms. When people say that they might mean Azure, AWS, or in the old days, Windows or Windows Server or Unix then Linux. Yes, those are platforms. You extend them. But you also extend Office. You add value partners plug in. They write applications. They use the file formats. All of this stuff is platform. Part of the issue (I think) for Microsoft is if you see yourself as just a platform company, platforms need apps. You want to have the top first-party app that runs on your platform. Otherwise your platform canât get good. Office was the best first-party app on Windows, and thatâs how things get good. Outlook was the best first-party app on exchange. There were other clients at one point, by the way. So you really do want extensibility in your apps in addition to your âplatform.â You want to make sure you own first-party app in addition to âplatform.â I think you can get stuck in the mud if you say weâre just a platform company. I think we got it into our corporate mindset that we were âa platform companyâ far more than I ever intended. There were people telling me in the mid- to late-2000s, well we canât do that. Weâre a platform company. I said, yes, we can do that. By 2010, I was just frustrated with myself and my inability to get people out of the, weâre-just-a-platform company. I think to this day you have to think app with platform. You have to think extensibility of the app and the âplatform.â I think we got caught on that. Maybe I got caught on it for a while, and I certainly got caught in my inability to tell people what the company needed to do because people had such a culture then of saying weâre a platform company. Weâre a platform. Now I go back to, developers, developers, developers. Iâm trying to tell people at that time that third-parties really mattered. You got different opinions inside Microsoft. Ben: And what event was this at? Steve: The developer conference, I think. Ben: So itâs for external developers? Steve: External developers. Whoâs Windowsâ number one client? Is it Office or is it all developers? You ask the Windows team, itâs all developers. You ask the Office team, come on, you got to do for us what we need to do. You have to be able to communicate that you really care about developers who are not your own. That you really want these things because they may think, oh, itâs all about running Microsoft Office. We just had to tell people, we want you, we want you, we want you, we want you. I think we got caught in thinking itâs all about third-parties and not also about our first-party apps. Thatâs where you say, are you a, the word âconsumerâ sounds unserious. Are you for users and for enterprises? Which really means IT departments. Or are you for users and not IT departments? And do you allow both all aspects of what you do to be extended by developers? Thatâs the frame I believe in. We had some issues over the course of where we went in the 2000. We can talk about that if you want to. But go back to 1999, come on, we need you guys on Windows. IBM still selling OS/2. Linux is right there on the horizon. Itâs coming like a freight train. Ben: Is the web starting to enter your psyche at all? Steve: The webâs part of that. Weâre trying to get people to write for Windows Server, good point. Weâre trying to get them to extend ActiveX controls, I think. Weâre the part of the browser. We were trying to get our browser to be a platform, embrace and extend I think is what we said. Weâll embrace the Internet and weâll extend with these ActiveX controls. We need developers to do ActiveX, we need them to do Windows Server. Weâre just getting ready on .NET. I have my own wild style. How do you end a speech? You tell people you love them, that you want them. Thatâs the call to action. Thatâs where I think the developers, developers, developers thing came. Before that one, there was a different video that people characterize it. Ben: I love this company? Steve: No, it was my Windows video. I donât know if youâve ever seen that. Ben: Oh, of course, but wasnât that a parody? Donât people misunderstand? Steve: It was for fun. It was just a fun thing. It was not a real speech. Ben: And it was for internal consumption where you were saying, for this low, low price. Steve: Yeah. Thereâs a lot of little nuances in there. Weâre trying to get our people pumped up about Windows. Ben: What I was looking for there is the developers, developers, developers speech is one where you feel like we havenât really won the last battle yet. Weâre still in this death grip for enterprise developers or this death fight against IBM, and yet thereâs now Linux and the web for these more independent or platform-of-the-futureâlooking developers. In some ways, were desperate to sell, to win, to say, hey, we have a great platform here. You need to come use our stuff. Steve: Exactly. I canât remember whether weâre pre-LAMP or LAMP by then. But I donât remember. Thereâs some infrastructure on top of Linux that people are using to write, letâs say theyâre backends not their user-facing code. We had tons of competition. The interesting thing is people say, only think about your customer. Never think about your competitor. I actually think you have to think about both. Ironically, we were pretty consumed with our competitor, which (I think) was essential, and we were pretty consumed about doing new things. But the competitor thing wound up being very important. We have no business. Weâre not in the enterprise. We could lose Windows on the client. The company werenât really self-confident. The DOJ was really self-confident that we were a lock and there was no competition, and life was easy. Thatâs not where our heads were. Now, there is some time in the 2000s where we think extending. We did a slide once called Windows everywhere. We used to use this on all these devices. We became too wed to extending what we had versus jumping to something new because in a sense, we were too confident if we only Windows-ized something. You guys make a point in your episode on us. You guys call it sticking with Windows too long. That may be it, but I donât think we stuck with Windows too long. I think what we did is we tried to put Windows in places that it didnât naturally go, and we tried to be too Windows-ey both in the API and the UI in some things. Ben: Mobile being an obvious. Steve: Windows Mobile, exactly. Ben: And the car. Steve: We did a layer on Windows that when you hooked your PC up to the TV, it had a simplified user interface on your TV. David: Oh, yeah. I remember this. Ben: It wasnât just Media Center, right? It was someâ¦ Steve: Media Center, exactly right. We became convinced to some degree paranoia and some degree confidence. Well our birthright here comes from Windows. Thatâs our permission to enter the area. But then we also, in some areas, it just wasnât going to be extensible. There was both a fear and an overstated confidence in trying to take Windows everywhere. Ben: All right, listeners. Itâs time to talk about another one of our favorite companies, Statsig. Since you last heard from us about Statsig, they have a very exciting update. They raised their Series C valuing them at $1.1 billion. David: Huge milestone. Congrats to the team. Timing is interesting because the experimentation space is really heating up. Ben: So why do investors value Statsig saying at over a billion dollars? Itâs because experimentation has become a critical part of the product stack for the worldâs best product teams. David: This trend started with Web 2.0 companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb. Those companies faced a problem. How do you maintain a fast, decentralized product and engineering culture while also scaling up to thousands of employees? Experimentation systems were a huge part of that answer. These systems gave everyone at those companies access to a global set of product metrics from page views, to watch time, to performance. Then every time a team released a new feature or product, they could measure the impact of that feature on those metrics. Ben: So Facebook could set a company-wide goal, like increasing time in-app, and let individual teams go and figure out how to achieve it. Multiply this across thousands of engineers and PMs, and boom, you get exponential growth. Itâs no wonder that experimentation is now seen as essential infrastructure. David: Todayâs best product teams like Notion, OpenAI, Rippling, and Figma are equally reliant on experimentation. But instead of building it in-house, they just use Statsig. And they donât just use Statsig for experimentation. Over the last few years, Statsig has added all the tools that fast product teams need, like feature flags, product analytics, session replays and more. Ben: So if you would like to help your teams, engineers, and PMs figure out how to build faster and make smarter decisions, go to statsig.com/acquired, or click the link in the show notes. They have a super generous free tier, a $50,000 startup program, and affordable enterprise contracts for large companies. Just tell them that Ben and David sent you. Letâs jump to this point, but what is the generalizable lesson here? You have Windows, this amazing piece of software with this tremendous multi-sided network effect around it. The logical thing to do is to continue to try and extend it and say, geez, wouldnât it be nice if the next great technology wave was also Windows? Steve: And that worked for us on Windows Server. Itâs not like we didnât have an existence proof that the thing could work. But if youâre going to, in my little deck I gave you. Ben: Yes, please. Steve: If youâre trying to skate to where the puck is, if youâre trying to recognize, what did I call this about capabilities, if youâre a startup in something, thereâs an ongoing business, you just keep enhancing your products. Thereâs a line extension. Okay, weâre going to add networking to Windows. No problem. You still call it Windows. Itâs related. But new, SQL Server for example, was that for a while. It was related because we had a backend platform. Dynamics, somewhat related, our accounting, et cetera stuff. Because there was some enterprisey sales, but it was really new. It turned out the phone was more like a startup, recognizing and thinking about things, and then asking yourself, what capabilities do you need? I say get in the weight room. Youâve got to develop capability. Take a look at a capability we developed that is now essential. We didnât build it for this reason. Hardware design. Microsoftâs a major hardware design company now. I started it out mostly to help client-side devicesâXbox, Surface, phone. And guess what? They use that mostly now in Azure data centers. I think the guy who actually runs hardware design used to be on Xbox. The backend hardware design for the data centerâthe chip, et cetera, infrastructureâIâm pretty sure there were a lot of talent we brought in. Building capabilities is important. We built some capability, but we didnât build enough capability. We didnât see things as different enough. Okay, letâs try to keep the comfortable Windows user interface because people understand it. It wasnât right for the phone. I donât even remember what processors we started out on, but Iâm pretty sure we started out on Intel. Of course that wasnât right. We tried to keep too much consistency, both out of a fear that this was our permission to exist and out of a self-confidence that we had to put Windows everywhere. Ben: So when should a company that has an existing fantastic business say, no, no, no. We cannot extend our existing franchise to this new world. This new world is going to be dominated by some new paradigm where we have no advantage. How do you play that? Steve: And then do we choose to get in? Ben: Exactly. Steve: Then you have to choose to get in. I would say two things were true at the time for us. Ben: And this is specifically about mobile. Steve: Itâs also about something else. Itâs a little bit about search too. There were two things that are true. Number one, you have to be focusing consciously on the issue. Itâs easy to get caught up, thereâs innovatorâs dilemma. Itâs a little different, but you get caught up in what you have, you get caught up in what you get caught up in the capabilities, and thatâs why I say to myself, you explicitly have to think about it. If we hadnât developed a bunch of capabilities we had, AI, if we hadnât built Bing, company wouldnât have capabilities. David: You built some capabilities in online services that willâ¦ weâll come back to that. Steve: We built some important capabilities, but we didnât realize the businesses were enough different to harness those in the new ways. Iâm proud of the capabilities we built. Didnât apply them the way we should have. Where did we learn to build internet-scale infrastructure? Well, some with Azure, some even more than Azure, being even more than Azure to get started. The Office. Whatâs now in M365? The Office backend, because that got critical mass as a cloud infrastructure before Azure did. Even more so with Bing. We developed the capabilities, but then you look at the product and what was our strategy for Bing? Well, thereâs too much based upon Windows integration. You have to say this is a separate part. David: Before the Bing rebrand, it was Windows Live Search. Youâre not going to be Google with Windows Live. Steve: Everything was Windows Live. Itâs now OneDrive. But the file sharing. Googleâs done the same thing. You got to ask where do you run out of gas? Ben: Because you could make the counter argument, shoot, Google is running away with the market. Itâs very good technology. Theyâve perfected the user experience. They have scale. You need scale in this business. Uh-oh, itâs a runaway train that weâre never going to catch. Thank God we have Windows to be able to have some way we can attack them from the side. With Windows integration, maybe that gives us a fighting chance. That didnât end up being true, but you can paint that narrative at least. We canât fight Google head on. Steve: No, I need to tell you something. Look, how late were we to search? The answer is when did Google start? 1998â1999? David: 1998. Steve: Okay. And we jumped in in 2003, I think we pushed. Now youâd say five years is a lot, or you could say five years isnât that much. You could say we had no birthright. Itâs just a completely separate thing. We had no capability. We had nobody whoâd grown up in that world. We had some guys in Microsoft Research who could start getting us there. We took talent that was doing other things in Microsoft. Itâs hard to go get new talent because search is brand new. There were people from Inktomi, Google had sucked them up. So it took us a while to get off the ground. It took us a while even, to be fair, I think this is something both Bill and I debated, not just with each other, but just we kicked around too much, how much âthe verticalsâ in online services would be important versus search and portal is generic. So search and portal is generic. But remember, we had a thing called Expedia. We built a travel site. We built a local information site called Sidewalk. We had a car shopping site. What did we call that thing? CarPoint. How much would the verticals be worth? There was one vertical that mattered, except it wasnât really vertical. Itâs called all shopping. There was all information and all shopping, doing all these detailed specific things. Remember we did a portal. We did that. Then eventually, we did search a few years later. We were just off. We had the wrong thing. Stack ranked in the wrong way, my opinion, with 20/20 hindsight. We were spread too thin. He said, when should you get into a new thing? Well, you probably shouldnât get into five new things if you really only have the talent for one to two new things. Thatâs number one. Scott McNeely of Sun used to have this expression used, âWe got to get all our wood behind one arrow.â Itâs nice to try. I was listening to you guys talk about Amazon and how they, okay, weâre going to try small things, but they also put in small cost structure. We put in big cost structure because we were already all in when we got into something. In this particular case, a few years later, and then what do you do? You get stuck. We have permission to come from behind in a certain way here because weâve got Windows, to your point. Exactly your point. There are lessons to be learned, but for a company thatâs got an established business, being able to get all the way outside of yourself and say, is this really like what weâre doing? Because you really want it to be. You really want it to be. Or does this really require a different approach that all doesnât totally ignore, but doesnât take into account what you own any more than the person starting it afresh. Can you hire new capability or how do you build new capability? Because if itâs not like what youâre already doing, it must require new capability. If itâs exactly like what youâre doing, then youâd be doing it. Ben: And you should be great at it. Steve: And youâd be great at it. Just look. Two models worked in phone. Build the hardware, capture the profit, have a backend monetization system that even lets you pay the phone manufacturer. That worked. Android/Google. Two things worked. Thatâs it. And we werenât in either one. We needed new capability. We needed a new idea. We couldnât use the Windows user interface. There were a bunch of things, but you have to go all the way. Yet we had a Windows everywhere slide. Ben: It was on the slide. I donât understand why it didnât work. Steve: I wrote this thing down here. You get locked in your model. Weâre a platform company. No, weâre an app and platform company. Ben: On our episode, we threw out the idea that Microsoftâs competitor, like the truest form that it should have taken on mobile was not actually Apple. The iPhone is not the bogey. Itâs a pretty different thing. At that point, you were not a hardware company. The bogey was Android. They were monetizing it a different way through advertising and through giving away for free. Microsoft always monetized through licensing revenue. It seems like until Android took off, Microsoft actually did have an opening to become the second mobile. Steve: What year Christmas was this? There was the Christmas of blah-blah-blah year. It was being on time with the stuff we needed for Verizon. There was a Verizon design win because Verizon by now is really feeling itâs getting its ass kicked. David: iPhone launch is on AT&T. Ben: July of 2007. Steve: It mightâve been Christmas even 2008. Ben: Yeah, because the App Store launch next year. Steve: I think Christmas 2008. Possibly even 2009. But I think 2008. Ben: Mobile was this when it started. Steve: It could have even been 2009. But Verizon, the empire had to strike back against AT&T, and there was a window. David: And they went with Troy. Steve: We didnât have our stuff. Look, they wouldâve taken our stuff because they could put pressure back on the manufacturers, but we didnât have the stuff they wanted at the right time. They went Android. Then we kept pushing because I believe in staying hardcore, and then learning and fixing. The problem was we were so locked into our model, it was hard to, to say, hey, weâre going to learn and fix. I donât know where we wouldâve gone with things on phone if I had stuck around. But I probably wouldâve stayed at it. Maybe it would be an Android phone at this stage. Who knows? And maybe not. If you think of yourself as just a platform company, you say we canât do that. If you can think of yourself as an app and platform company with apps that are extensible, ah, then you can say, hey, we actually have a pretty cool user experience that can also leverage some things that we do and can leverage our software skills. Itâs okay to embrace that competitor and extend. But there are so many technologies that are hard to not just popularize, but even get good at unless you have a phone these days. Just take voice. If you want to really be good at voice, you got to get enough signal and youâll get the signal off the phone. You canât say, talking to my PC is sufficient. If you want to get good at maps, there are so many things where being on phones and there are some things even you can make happen by being on cars. I think Tesla gets good at certain things in software because it is a different form of mobile, so they get good at different things. But we missed. Should the company have kept after it? I donât know. Satya knows and Amy and company, they know where they were. But to your original question, big companies deciding, well, itâs not always a mistake to build off what you got, but it can be. Try to get outside of yourself. If you get in, do you have the ability from the top to shake the system and say, no, we started with our old model, but itâs not going to work. Thatâs what I did with Surface. I didnât wind up. It hasnât played out partly. I didnât have as much time with it. There were no high-end PCs that would really compete with Mac. I decided the only way we were going to get there, we couldnât sit there with our OEM model and have it work, if weâre going to have high-end PCs that appealed to users because I wanted us to be a consumer/user company, not just an IT company. Thinkpad had IBM. By then, Lenovo had some higher-end computers. But you never saw them in schools. You never saw them in coffee shops. We needed a high-end PC, and the economics, marketing, and romancing it was not going to be an option for our OEMs. I said we got to go do Surface. Again, would we have tweaked things, done things a little bit better? Part of that, iPad, sure. But the model was not going to work. Ben: Weâve spent a lot of time talking about all these bets that sound very reasonable to make in mobile, in search. We didnât talk about social, but in social and all the dancing you did with Mark Zuckerberg over the years, in Yahoo, in all these things that ended up not panning out, and these were trillion-dollar companies that were built not inside of Microsoft. We talked about one multi-trillion dollar thing that did work with the enterprise. Thereâs another one with Azure. Can you tell us the story of how Azure really got started? Steve: We are in probably 2005â2006. AWS has a little lift off. I think AWS comes to market around then. Itâs not like the cloud is some surprise to us. The Energizer, if you go all the way back to that Energizer thing from the mid-90s, itâs all about the cloud. Itâs before it was called the cloud. Itâs before all the infrastructure that becomes the cloud. Itâs not like we say, oh, woke up one day, itâs oh, thereâs AWS. We didnât wake up one day and say, oh there are backends to applications too. Weâve been doing that with Windows Server and SQL Server. Weâve been in the cloud, blah-blah-blah. But at that point, I think we might have already had Exchange in the cloud as a standard product. Which you have to remember is super important because I really want to give you my sense of what Microsoftâs businesses are. But we didnât have a platform. So I said, we got to do one. Letâs go get Cutler. I say, okay, we got to get Cutler on it. Cutler and I have a great relationship. To this day, we have a great relationship. Heâs a personal friend. Ben: Heâs still writing code at Microsoft. Steve: Heâs still writing code at Microsoft. Ben: Unbelievable. Steve: Cutler and I have been to a basketball game together. Weâve played golf a number of times. Weâve done golf trips together. Cutlerâs a hard ass at work. If he doesnât want to do something, heâll tell you. If he thinks you are wrong, heâll tell you. If he thinks somebody else in the organization is bad, heâll tell you. David: Heâs like a thoroughbred horse. Steve: Heâs very blunt. David: You can run really fast, but you got to get him. Steve: Heâs very blunt, was a great athlete in college. Two sports. I think he played maybe three even in college. But anyway, so I get Cutler, and thereâs a guy working in MSR who I think is underutilized too. This guy Amitabh Srivastava, you guys talk about. I thought he was underutilized doing what he is doing. So grab him, grab Cutler, bring them both onto this project. Is Billy still with the company? David: Heâs about to transition out. Steve: Heâs about to leave, I think. David: Yeah. I think he had probably told you that he was going to leave. Steve: He had told me but hadnât left yet. He was involved until he left. Even then, different nature of involvement. But anyway, I get Cutler and Amitabh to go do this thing. Then Cutler brings some of his (Iâll call) gang, his favorite guys. He brings them over because heâs a magnet for talent, and we get started. We made an explicit decision. I guess you could say itâs also a function of thinking Windows first. I think you guys may have talked about this in your episode. We say weâre going to build Platform as a Service because itâs a Windows platform. Infrastructure as a service a little bit, if you think about it. You are by nature accepting everybodyâs infrastructure. Itâs âby nature,â âmulti-platform.â You become a different kind of a platform because youâre running other peopleâs Linux and whatever. Ben: It doesnât leverage Microsoftâs strength of owning the Windows franchise if youâre just going to be infrastructure. Steve: No, it doesnât leverage our strengths in the sense that weâve got great low-level operating system people. We have all the talent to go do it, and it was explicit we wanted to do Platform as a Service. We said: (a) theyâre doing it, (b) itâs all about the developers. If itâs all about the developers, then you got to have Platform as a Service, not just Infrastructure as a Service. Ben: Well that assumes that the developers targeting Windows Server are still a big, strong, important, relevant developer group. Steve: Which they were and they werenât. Windows Server had a strong developer group. Unix had a strong developer group. On the front end, Windows was definitely stronger. On the backend, Unix was definitely stronger. Ben: But on the front end, by 2006â2007, the web was clearly the emerging developer platform of choice. Steve: Absolutely emerging. Not fully emerged. Emerging. Ben: I would challenge you to say, in 2006 what amazing Windows apps were coming out that would sweep the world and go get a hundred million users because they were great apps? Steve: Hard for me to remember. I think if you go to the field of productivity, the answer is yes there were still. The problem is if you left the areas of productivity and gaming, I think the answer was no. The web wasnât good for a number of things for IT because people didnât feel like they could count on the connectivity. Either the amount of bandwidth or latency or just itâs very existence. We are still at that point. Iâm not saying fair. We were right in the way we thought about. Not saying that. But Iâm also saying there was still a great Windows developer ecosystem. It didnât go from a lot 1999 to nothing by 2005. Ben: Totally fair. Steve: And then on Windows Server, Unix was stronger on the backend. Of course, weâre trying to make Windows strong and weâre trying to get to the cloud. Then weâre learning more things about the cloud from both Exchange in the cloud and Azure in the cloud. How do you make it easy to provision? Whatâs the speed of provisioning? What do you do to serve developers? The notion that you give them a set of free usage and then let them embrace. Developers have two aspects too. There are developers who are not part of enterprises and theyâre developers who are. The developers who are not part of enterprises need a whole different sales motion. You can call them consumer developers, not developers of consumer apps. Theyâre not like big corporations in terms of the way they use. Students are an example, but there are plenty of others who are trying to do startups and blah-blah-blah. In any event, we get going. Weâre learning how to do the things. Weâre building capability for sure in the cloud through both products. By the time I leave, we have some momentum with Azure, but some momentum. The big momentum really is in the last 11 years since I left. David: Well, I think youâre bypassing and underselling here. It really struck me as you were describing the challenges around with a big company like Microsoft, and attacking wildly different vectors like mobile, search, hardware. Azure was that. The cloud was extremely disruptive. The server and tools,what you were doing. Steve: It was extremely disruptive, but it wasnât. Yes and no. The things we understood were translatable. Now, getting the company, people get locked into a model. David: Well you had to replace server and tools. Leadership to make this happen. Steve: Well IT accept things that run in the cloud. That was not obvious back in 2008â2009. Itâs not like Amazon was an enterprise company at the time. It was mostly for startups. Thatâs who was using AWS at the time, so no. I do agree with you. We had to shake up our internal culture. This was my basic message. God dang it. This is our future. We can preserve and enhance these businesses. We can take more value out of the system because the customers donât have to set up their servers anymore. They donât have to do all this work. Essentially, money that wouldâve been spent on people and hardware will get spent with us. Come on, weâre going to do this. It was hard for me even telling our people there was still La RÃ©sistance, as they say, and thatâs why I did the speech at UDub, where we talked about the fact that weâre all in on the cloud. It was partly a reminder to people, get with it or get out of it. Get out of the way. Ben: Making an external speech to communicate something to your internal employees. Steve: In a big company, man, Iâll tell you. Some of what you have to do because people believe the newspaper more than theyâll believe an internal email. Ben: People always talk about how the think different campaign that Steve Jobs did was for Apple employees as much as it (in fact) way more than for the general public. Going back to the core initial start of Azure, I find it very interesting that Microsoft had a business called server and tools business, and that is not where Azure started. Azure started as an incubation by Ray Ozzie with a completely separate team than your existing actual product group selling server and tools. Steve: But thatâs a classic thing. It shouldnât be mind-blowing. Windows and Windows NT were in different groups, too. Sometimes in order to protect the baby while it grows up, you canât put it with the thing thatâs established. You could say itâs part of the issue with Windows, when we tried to use Windows on things for which we probably should have started. David: I was going to ask you, would it have played out differently if youâd taken this approach with mobile? Steve: We did break it out, but we constrained it with Windows. We broke Windows NT out and constrained it with Windows. It worked fine because Windows belong. How you do those incubations, in this case I just said, look. Itâll get probably subsumed. I donât know. Partly, Ray wanted some operating control over the thing, and putting it under [...] wouldâve made it harder for Ray. Obviously, it was less palatable. Iâm not sure Cutler wouldâve gone to work on it if it was all server tools. But it was the right thing to do even though it was âpart of the future of server.â It was the future of server and tools, essentially. Ben: And so this is pretty lost in the common narrative. If this is 2006, that is 7â8 years before you left Microsoft. Steve: Yeah, eight years. Weâd been working on the cloud since Energizer. Weâd been working on Azure for eight years. People think everything in tech gets popular in 10 minutes. Ben: People think Acquired was founded two years ago. Steve: Good point. David: Different scale. Steve: When was OpenAI actually founded? David: 2016, I think. Steve: So seven or eight years after it really became something. Fair to say. I give them all the credit in the world, seven or eight years. Most things take a while. Even things that are âoh, they just burst on the scene.â People have been sweating blood, sweat, and tears for years before these things get lift-off, as I call it my little deck here. We were starting to get lift-off, but yeah, eight years. We had more in on Exchange. Most businesses are zero trick ponies. Ben: You never create a billion dollar business. Steve: Yeah. You might create something that goes nowhere. You might create whatâs essentially a feature for somebody elseâs business and get acquired. You might. I call that zero tricks. Then you get a one-trick pony. One-trick ponies are amazing. People should be in awe of one-trick ponies. David: One-trick ponies are $50â$100 billion market cap companies. Steve: Or it could be more. David: Yeah, or more. Theyâre not many one-trick ponies. Steve: I might argue that Googleâs a one to one-and-a-halfâtrick pony. Still, if you just look at its revenueâ¦ Ben: 80% search ad revenue, something like that. Steve: YouTubeâs half a trick you can call it a psychic trick, but itâs, itâs not clearly a second trick. And theyâre huge. They have great market cap. TSMC. You did an episode on them. Theyâre a one-trick pony. A very successful one-trick pony. Nvidia is a one-trick pony. Ben: Well, gaming and AI. Steve: Okay, Iâll give them two tricks. David: Two-trick pony but the first trick was not that big. Steve: You can decide whether to call it a trick or not, but Iâm not taking anything away from Nvidia, and I should know the company better. But, so you say one-trick ponies. Theyâre amazing. Everybody should be in awe of a one-trick pony. Now, two-trick ponies, ooh la la. Those people tend to go down in business history, especially those tricks stay alive for a long time. IBM was a one-trick pony. Microsoft two to two-and-a-half tricks. David: All right, give us your trick accounting. Steve: Okay, you could do it a little differently. Iâm going to call the desktop business, which I include Windows and Office, and the server/enterprise business, BackOffice. Two tricks. Now, both tricks could have died if they didnât get moved to the cloud, and I knew they could die. But theyâre two tricks. Two different revenue models, two different licensing models, essentially different sales motions. Even the way Microsoft sells those stuff. I donât know about today, but when I left, they were different muscles. One account manager, two different muscles. Because one youâre selling applications, and one youâre just selling, hey, this is to serve your users. You need an AD account, an Exchange account. Itâs exactly Windows. Thatâs what you need. This is what M365, you could call the modern translation of those two things are the Windows OEM business and M365, and Azure. Then you could say, is gaming its own trick? I call it a half a trick. Just like you two. Itâs half a trick. Ben: This is an update since we last talked. I feel like we had a conversation at one point were we both landed in unclear how profitable that business is for Microsoft relative to other. Steve: I could call it a half trick, or you could say it could be a trick. Look, I would say Microsoft is optimistic itâll be a full-on trick. I ran into Phil Spencer at the golf course and heâs a real optimistic guy. It could be. David: Iâll give you this. If we call NVIDIAâs first trick a full trick, then Xbox is a full trick. There we go. Steve: Whatever you want to call it. You said itâs a small trick and I think thatâs probably right. Thatâs amazing. Amazonâs a two-tricker. AWS and the store, theyâre two-tricker. Appleâs two-tricks. Ben: Whatâs your trick accounting there? Steve: Mac and mobile, if you want to say itâs high power consumption and low power consumption. Ben: Is it fair to call services a third? By my estimates, their profit dollars from services have now eclipsed iPhone hardware profit. Steve: I consider it just part of the trick. David: If you go by your platform definition, itâs part of the platform. Steve: I call really a trick, theyâve just monetized it. Itâs like us adding things to Office and redoing the EA. Ben: Itâs a monetization model. Steve: Itâs an additional monetization model, but itâs not a new locomotive. A locomotive is the business that can pull the cabooses, and the locomotive remains the phone. The services business go away pretty quick if the phone volume fell apart. Itâs additional, very importantâ¦ Ben: But not uncorrelated the way that AWS andâ Steve: No. And I think Mac versus everything iOS is also uncorrelated. David: Yeah. I get the sense you really wanted three tricks. Steve: Abso-fricking-lutely. Ben: Whatâs the one that eats you up inside? Which one do you think you were closest to getting that you didnât get? Steve: Not social. Forget social. Ben: Doesnât feel Microsoft-ey. David: You wanted to buy Facebook. Steve: Iâm going to tell you why. Weâre still on the Paul Allen strategy. Weâve got to do all the software that these things will ever need. It was still of the mindset that said, and thereâs an arrogance to that and thereâs a hunger to that that says thereâs just nothing we shouldnât do. I donât think that was a good mindset by the time I took over, and yet it was still baked in with Bill, baked in with me, and I think that was a mistake not focusing. This is like asking me to pick between negative children. I donât know. But the phone because it was a client-side device, or search because it was a productivity tool. Both of those were Microsoft big businesses. The desktop, the phone, or office, client-side devices, we had done well with a certain model. Client-side devices, our mind should have been able to wrap around, but we had to tell ourselves it didnât look the same. Technology didnât look the same, nor did business model. Ben: Then business model astonishingly for search. Advertising, call it 2005. I think Google was making more money off of a PC user than Microsoft was because their business model generated more search revenue. Steve: By 2005, I donât think so. Not later on, I think so. But not by 2005. I would suspect not. You can go check that. Ben: But isnât that astonishing? That of the pie. Steve: And for enterprise PCs, PCs bought by businesses, it certainly wouldnât have been the case. For consumer PC, it could well have already been the case. It actually is a notable difference because of everything else. Our post sales monetization was with applications. Weâre with ads, but it was a new productivity app. We put Office on the back by then. We wouldâve had to put productivity elsewhere, in the sense that we missed a major productivity area. We were in the productivity business and in the client area, and we missed a client device. Those are the two. Nothing else we met, we âmissed.â David: You had an opportunity for four-tricks, and you got two. Steve: Yeah. Part of the problem was particularly, we didnât see mobile as a different trick. We thought of it as underneath the Windows trick, if you will. But it means you can go through. I donât know that I could come up with a three-trick pony for you. Itâs possible that at the Elon level, the Musk empire could have three tricksâcars, connectivity, andâ¦ Ben: In finance, you can do it. Steve: Finance, I donât think there are multiple tricks. You could say asset management versus theâ¦ Ben: Investment banking is different. Steve: Maybe. I donât know. Iâm not convinced. But I hear you. Possible. David: Well, I think this makes sense because Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world with two. So if anybody have threeâ Steve: If you look at the most valuables, youâre not going to find threes. Ben: Thatâs a good point. Sony is nowhere near the market cap of these companies, but itâs pretty evenly diversified across their five segments, from gaming to consumer electronics. David: Movies, music, finance. Ben: Yeah. They have a remarkable diversified. Steve: They bought businesses in multiple areas, but I canât call Sony Pictures a trick. Itâs just not big enough. What you can acquire to start a trick, that part thereâs no pride. Pride in having a trick that starts with something small. David: Androidâs a good example. Google bought Android, but thatâs a trick for them. Steve: Well, Androidâs not a trick. You highlighted it. Android is a piece of the search trick. Ben: Itâs a lead gen. Steve: Exactly. Lead generation for search. Yeah, thatâs right. Ben: Okay. Listeners, now is a great time to thank one of our longtime friends of the show, but actually first time sponsor, Vercel. David: Vercel is an awesome company. Over the past few years, theyâve become the infrastructure backbone that powers modern web development. If you visited a fast, responsive website lately, thereâs a good chance it was built and deployed on Vercel. Ben: The reason for this is Vercel has completely reimagined the entire web developer experience. In the old world before Vercel, if you were a web developer, you basically had two completely different jobs you had to do. One was write code, and then you had to deploy the code to your production infrastructure, which (a) was not a simple task and distracted you from what you were really good at, and (b) usually introduced all sorts of bugs and reliability or latency issues that you had to iron out. David: Vercel did away with this distinction entirely. They built what they call the complete platform for the web, which is a framework to find infrastructure that transforms your code into live, globally distributed production applications automatically. For developers, thereâs no more wrestling with deployment nonsense. You just push your code and it runs, fast. Ben: Itâs a pretty incredible technical infrastructure, which is no surprise because Vercelâs founder, Guillermo Rauch, is himself a pioneering web developer in the modern era. He started Next.js, which is one of the worldâs most popular open source frameworks used by folks like Walmart, the Verge, Nike, Hulu, Anthropic, Claude, the list goes on. David: We did an ACQ2 episode with Guillermo back in February. Go check it out. You canât listen to that and not walk away going, wow, this guy and this company are unbelievably compelling. Ben: Weâll be talking about Vercel all season, including their newest product that is just blowing up called V0, which is an actual AI web developer that you can just ask in plain English to build websites for you. David: Itâs wild. Go listen to the ACQ2 episode and itâll become obvious why Guillermo and Vercel didnât stop at just, oh, letâs eliminate deployment as a barrier to people building fast websites. Letâs also now go eliminate writing code as a barrier as well. Ben: In some cases. Well, if you want to learn more about what Vercel can do for web development at your company and join customers like OpenAI, Granola, Runway, Supreme, Chick-fil-A, Ramp, PayPal, Under Armour, and NerdWalletâgosh, that is a lotâhead on over to vercel.com/acquired, and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. Okay. Weâve been dwelling here in the products and reflecting back on big wins and misses. During your tenure as CEO, can you reflect back on your non-product wins and mistakes? Steve: My biggest hit from my time running sales to president to CEO is establishing us with IT departments, IT professionalsâyou can call that the enterprise, if you willâputting in the framework from a sales and marketing perspective, the staff, Itâs a capability we had to develop. Nobody developed that software model but us. We invented essentially how you do that. Oracle had done some invention, but we came on and did our own invention. We took it to the cloud. We were able to successfully navigate that. From sales, there are product parts to that that let you highlight, but thatâs a big deal and I feel very, very proud about that. From a financial standpoint, everybody likes to say we about tripled revenue and about tripled profit. The truth is, we dramatically increased profit more than a triple. People forget there was a major change that came along early in my tenure. Thatâs the move to have to expense stock options. If you had restated our books to the time I actually took over, stock option expense would have reduced profits notably. Stock options were unaccounted for. If you look at what starting profitability wouldâve looked like if stock options had, it wouldâve been lower, and the multiple over my tenure wouldâve been much more than three. Ben: Okay, so three plus times in revenue. Steve: I think you might say three in revenue and probably closer to four plus, five maybe even on profit. About the same time the dot-com bubble busts. You have two problems. Number one, now weâre showing our books all this expense for stock options. Okay. But people donât value those things what we have to expense. And the stock is flat, so they value them even less. David: This is a really insidious problem. Steve: You got to get rid of stock options. We transition then from stock options to stock awards, which if you notice, I think we were the first to make that as a major transition, but everybodyâs made the same transition with the exception of a few senior executives, options are not the primary form of compensation. Little different in startups. But when you look at larger companies, everybodyâs, David: Even startups are now doing RSUs. Steve: RSUs, and we had to start that. David: I didnât realize that Microsoft started that. Steve: You can check, but I know we moved before most of the tech companies. Ben: Itâs a tough thing to have to inherit right at the beginning of your tenure, coming off of an already all-time high multiple of the stock price. Steve: The dot-com bubble bursting meant our stock price burst intoâ David: But I think to your point, what youâre saying is this became an employee motivation cultural issue. Itâs not just stock price. Steve: No. We had two problems. Before the dot-com bubble burst, you have everybody saying, oh, maybe we should go to a dot-com company because weâre going to make a lot more money. Then the bubble burst and everybody says, Iâm certain you guys [...] see the movie Oklahoma, but thereâs a song, Pore Jud is daid. Ben: Poor Jud is Dead, absolutely. Steve: A candle lights his haid. That was the way people felt about stock compensation. And not just at our place. People were down because everybody thought they had a ton and then they thought they had less. It was a real employee morale issue in the early 2000s. We had to really sell the stuff in. Thatâs a big thing I had to work on. Obviously the antitrust issues. David: When you took over as CEO, what we said in our episode was that was actually your number one priority, was just end this. Steve: It was right up there, yeah. It was up there. I think when I took over, Iâm not even sure we saw a path to resolution, but having it an overhang. Iâll give you a story because it was after I took over as CEO. We had an executive retreat. We did it down in Bend, Oregon. I canât remember the name of the lodge. Sun River, I think. We all fly down there. We rented a plane to fly everybody down there. I donât know how many people by then, it was probably 80â90, something like that. The first session was supposed to be a reportâwe did thisâfrom the field. What are people seeing out there? Whatâs the environment? And this guy, Orlando Ayala, was running sales at the time. He gets upâthis is probably 2002-ish, 2001â2002; weâre still in the throes of the thingâmy name is Orlando Ayala. Iâm a proud Colombian. I am not a proud Microsoftee today. Our integrity is under assault. My personal integrity feels like itâs under assault. Now, he didnât blame us for having behaved badly, but he highlighted the thing thatâs on everybodyâs mind, which is it wasnât just a business issue that needed to be taken care of. It was a culture issue. It was bothering people, particularly senior people, very personally. I had this whole agenda, had to blow the thing up and reorient to address that elephant in the room. It was not where I was going with this thing. Completely remap, change the breakout sessions, focus in on this issue. Bill was not happy with the whole thing. Bill bore the weight of the antitrust thing very hard because for him, I think it also felt like a personal attack. Everybody took it personally. Bill took it even more personally because he was the face of vilification, if you will for this. But itâs a reminder that it was a cultural issue to take care of, not just a market issue. People focus in on the, oh, were you moving slowly? Yeah, there was some of that too. People say, oh, I wonder if we can do this. That was an issue. The cultural issue I think was even bigger. He said, yeah, we got to get this thing resolved. Then there was the order to break us up. I forget what year that was. David: You were going to run one company and Bill was going to run the other company. Steve: We never really got to the point of really planning that through. David: But thatâs what the federal government ordered. Steve: They ordered it split. They didnât say who had to run which company. Ben: I think it was just that you couldnât be at the same. David:: You couldnât be at the same company. Steve: I think it was, I would run operating systems and Bill would take applications. It just gives you a sense of where each of us were associated within the mind of the company. Ben: So thatâs your starting place as youâre taking over as CEO. The dot-com bubbles bursting, antitrust is dominating the companyâs culture and the external narrative. You have this big accounting headache that you now have to deal with that affects the way your profitability has shown. But then thereâs a decade after that where you triple the business, but the stock price is flat. Why didnât Wall Street get? Steve: Iâm going to give you three reasons. Reason number one, and itâs material. Bill and I, and then me and Bill when I became CEO, we always were trying to tell people, donât get our stock price too high. Donât have too big expectations for us. We never wanted people to feel like they got cheated buying our stock. Partly, probably weâre trying to lower the expectations on ourselves. I never thought of it that way. I donât think Bill did. But essentially that was part of it. So we do this financial analyst meeting every July, and weâd always warn people donât get too excited. Thatâs one. As part of that whole theme, Bill never went to a quarterly analyst call, and I never went to a quarterly analyst call. If you really think about it, part of morale is the stock price. It is. It took me a while to realize that, but I then never broke my pattern. Itâs like going to the newspaper every day. You donât sell stock every day, so you really should only care what the stock price is when you sell stock. But people go every day and itâs like, oh, did my team win last night? Itâs like going to the sports section, say how did the Clips do last night? So talking more regularly to investors and talking not pie-eyed but a realistic view. We gave no guidance. I had to fight people. They wanted to give guidance and I didnât want to give guidance. Why? Just deliver the results you get? There was a bit of a Buffet style thing going on, because Bill and Warren were very good friends and Warren didnât go to quarterly calls, I donât think. But heâs warned. David: I donât even know if they do quarterly calls. I donât think they do. Steve: If they do the annual meeting, obviously. Letâs call that a first reason. A second reason is yes, I did take over when the stock was ridiculously too highly priced. Ben: But that normalized within a year or two. Steve: The bubble burst. It normalizes some, but it creates another narrative about things. Next, I was hardcore about telling people Iâm going to spend to do the things we need to do to succeed. David: Thatâs not what Wall Street likes to hear. Steve: No, but I was viewed as a spender, and I was much louder on this than Satya is on anything financial, because itâs how Iâm programmed. Heâs programmed a little differently. And Amy is more balanced. Sheâll talk about balance, and I would say weâre going to win with Surface, whatever it is. Ben: If I could paraphrase my view of it, you were willing to say, weâre going to spend whatever it takes. Amy goes and says, Iâm going to account for every dollar of spend real tight and make sure that every dollar demands a return. Steve: Yeah. I had no credibility in terms of what some investors wanted to hear. And my actions were consistent with that. Itâs not like they were inconsistent. Then lastly, people did worry about the future of a couple of our franchises, most notably Windows. You get all these things, narrative, transition from high price, some issue about franchises, and me being a big spender, no wonder the stock stayed flat. By the end of my tenure, it was even bothering me. David: When did it start to bothering you? Steve: Towards the end. At some point I just got too tired. But by then, it was also probably hard for me to reset that dialogue, for me to go to investors and say, aha, Iâm a changed man. Iâm not going to spend anymore. Nobody was going to believe that shit. They just wouldnât have believed it. You canât come in and say, well, Iâve been a certain way for about 30 years, but hey, Iâm a new man. Iâm reformed. That doesnât work that way if youâre a spender. David: I worship at the altar of capital allocation now. Steve: If youâre a spender, youâre a spender. If youâre not good with investors, theyâre not going to buy in overnight that youâve changed. I didnât intend it that way, but thereâs a certain disrespect by not going to quarterly calls. With hindsight, people arenât going to say, oh, he is showing up. Heâs a changed man. He used to tell us the stock price was too high or worry about it. Now heâs going to tell us, no, the stock should be okay. It should be higher. No. There was no way to reset the investor view of me. Ben: You need a full rebrand, full clean slate. Some newâ Steve: Well, you probably need a full new CEO. When I wrote my letter of goodbye to the board, I did say, hey, look. This is a unique opportunity. There are a lot of things in our brand, in our image that would only be able to be reset by having a new CEO. People donât walk in and say, oh yeah guys are changing. Itâs hard to change the narrative without the change. Now Iâm not saying that means CEO should go every time thereâs a bad narrative. Thatâs not really my point. But it just gets harder. I may have only been CEO since 2000, but itâs not like I wasnâtâ David: Been there since 1980. Steve: Yeah, I was there since 1980. Essentially, Iâd been the second voice of the company for 20 years. Then for 14, I was the first voice, theoretically. Although that had some complexity too. Ben: I get the sense by the end it wasnât fun for you anymore too. Steve: Thatâs not true. Ben: No? Steve: No. The toughest time was probably the ship of Vista. That was probably the toughest time, that in the early 2000s when I took over. My little sheet here, I highlight that 1998 to 2004 were tough years, plus Xbox. Because thatâs the antitrust. Thatâs where I moved back to be president of the company and then CEO. Bill and I went through a year where we didnât speak. Ben: Really? Steve: Yeah. I think it was basically from some time in about March or April of 2000â2001. Literally, we werenât speaking. I didnât know what it meant to be his boss, and he didnât know what it meant to work for me. I knew he was struggling with the DOJ and all this. When he asked me to be CEO, I said, do you really want me to be CEO or do you just want me to be a figurehead? He said, no, I want you to be real CEO. Okay. That meant something to me. I would probably have said yes even if heâd said be a figurehead. But he said what he wanted and probably him saying to himself, hey, Iâve got to have a transition path. So I said, okay. Iâll do that. Well, he didnât know how to show me a different kind of respect. I didnât know how to show him a different kind of respect. There were things where I just disagreed with him, and now I expected it to go the other way. I was always happy. I was happy being a number two guy. I was fine. Salute. I donât like the decision. I either salute or Iâd body punch and then salute, or body punch and heâd agree with me. Body punch means itâs a slower process. Then we didnât know how to do that. We just didnât know how to do that. After a year, we started talking again. Basically our wives were the ones who pushed us back together. We had a very awkward dinner at a health club down the street here, but we get back together. But we never really got the right mojo. Billâs chief software architect, and I was very deferential then to product direction from Bill. Ben: Heâs working on Longhorn at this point because itâs post XP. Steve: Which was a mistake. Longhorn was a big mistake. I have to take accountability. I was a CEO, Billâs got to take a lot of accountability. It was the mistake of mistakes. Between the company, Bill and I disagreed about whether we should do hardware. That was a big one. We did. Surface was a big disagreement. Phone, big disagreement. HoloLens, big disagreement. David: What about Azure? Were you aligned? Steve: Bill was fine with Azure. The cloud Bill and I had agreed on in the 90s. Energizer, Energizer. I think Energizer could have been Billâs idea, not mine. Pretty sure it was Billâs idea, not mine. I executed, but Billâs idea, not mine. But we never hit it. There were places there should have been more contention. Maybe even during the late 90s. I donât know. But there were certainly places where there should have been more contention. My gut, these are the smart technical guys, Bill, and Iâm trustingâ¦ Ben: Vista. Steve: Iâm beginning to have a pit in my stomach. But we didnât have the right contention. This is not directed at Bill personally, itâs directed at all of this. We had an emperor that had no clothes. That was in Longhorn. It was the emperor that had no clothes. Partly, it was the centrality of Windows and the notion that Windows would say central, therefore people would all want this new stuff. Partly there was too much change all at one time. We didnât do a new operating system, but we were doing a new operating system. It may not have sold it all, but we probably wouldâve done better. Ben: Just not calling Windows. Steve: Well, no. Forget what we called it. Just starting from scratch. Maybe keeping parts of the kernel, but otherwise starting from scratch and throw out all the scruff. Now, I donât think we wouldâve popularized it. If weâd looked at it that way, we probably wouldnât have built it. But by then we were a little cocky about Windows and it was our thing. I donât think we had the right grind in our system there in the early 2000s. Between Bill and I, did we make some good decisions? Yeah, we did make a good decision to do Xbox. Were we doing too many things? Yeah, we were doing too many things. I would say there was probably a voraciousness misplaced by Bill and me. Maybe I had to be deal with some of the pragmatics of hiring people and stuff, so I didnât push back on it. But I probably felt the pain a little bit more in terms of trying to hire people. So thatâs 2000â2004. Then by 2004, Bill was already started talking to me about wanting to be able to go. Then in 2006, we announced that he was going to go in 2008. I also think we screwed that up. You canât have a long goodbye. Long goodbyes are not helpful. David: Yours was short. Steve: Yeah, it was goodbye. I stayed on the board for one more board meeting after I left. That was it. But a long goodbye, nobody knows their role. I think I did some of my very best work after Bill left. If you ask me when do I think I did my best work, when I started, and when I was running sales and evolving this enterprise business. Some when I ran system software, and then the last six years I was there. Thatâs cloud, thatâs surface, thatâs some of the improvements in Windows. I feel really good about my last six years. Bing. I think thatâs when we hired Qi Lu. Do you guys know the story of Qi Lu at Microsoft? Qi Luâs one of the most pivotal things at Microsoft? Why? David: I knew he was important, but tell us the story. Steve: Pivotal in a way you may not even know. First of all, brilliant guy. Great guy. Qiâs talking about leaving Yahoo. Heâs at Yahoo at the time. Qi (I think) went to graduate school with Harry Shum, who had been in Microsoft Research. Harry was now working on search, and he was working for Satya who was running Bing. Ben: Thatâs an amazing sentence all in itself. Oh, Satya the guy who was running Bing. Steve: He was running Bing. Harry says, Qiâs a genius. Weâve got to hire Qi. I donât know if Qi really wants to work for. Well, we got to pick Qiâs brain. We just have to learn from Qi Lu. Okay. Satya, me, Harry, fly down to California and we meet with Qi Lu. We talk to Qi. Qiâs brilliant and weâre learning all this stuff about Qi. Qi leaves the room. God, thereâs a lot. I donât know who throws the idea out at first, maybe Satya. We should hire Qi and I should work for him. Ben: Whoa. Steve: So Harry was all in. Harry worked for Satya who worked for Qi. Now we flipped it around. David: You flipped the Whole reporting structure to hire Qi in the room. Steve: After Qi walked, we talked for about 15 minutes. Then Harry calls Qi and said, do you mind coming back? David: Wow. Steve: I forget where Qi was thinking heâd take his next job. He had a next job in mind. Maybe it was with Baidu. I canât remember. Someplace. David: Then what did he do at Microsoft that made him so impactful? Steve: Itâs the story I just told you. Itâs what it told me about Satya. I love Satya. We were giving him more and more responsibilities anyway. But he told me this guy will do the right thing for the company. Heâll prioritize that. He doesnât have an ego that gets in the way. And Qi did great work. Qi knew about search. He was an old pro at it. Ben: And it started cash flowing billions of dollars eventually. Steve: Eventually. Satyaâs not an engineer by training. Qiâs an engineer. Heâs a PhD in computer science. He had a lot to bring. Satyaâs been great at managing product development, thatâs for sure, but Qiâs digging the bits and bytes kind of thing. But the meeting is the thing that was important. Qi was important, sure, but what Satya and Harry did that day where they just found a guy and said, please Steve, go hire him as our boss. Ben: You donât hear that very often. Steve: No. Ben: What year was that? David: It was after Yahoo, 2008â2009. Ben: Six years before Satya became CEO for five years. Steve: 2009, yeah. And that let me then be able to also say, now I can give Satya more responsibility doing something else. Ben: Why did you move him to server and tools? Steve: We had Qi, so we could probably move him. I thought it would be important to give him other experiences, to try to get him to be able to be CEO. He was on a list of three or four internals at that time, who he said heâd been on a list of guys we had been talking about because we did an annual succession plan thing. The succession plan has two candidates. Itâs what happens if you get hit by a bus and what happens if you get served to term, whatever term feels like. And theyâre different people. If Satya gets hit by a bus, if Satya serves another five years, itâs probably a different person. I think thatâs true in most companies. You got to think about it differently. Anyway I said, hey, get him another experience. He hasnât worked in apps, hasnât worked in server and tools, and it was a good time to switch things around. Bob wound up obviously being super successful because. Bob was running server and tools at the time. I love Bob. Bobâs, one of my favorite guys Iâve ever worked with. Ben: Went on to be CEO of Snowflake. David: Snowflake, yeah. Steve: Absolutely. David: Worked out for everybody. Steve: Heâs done fantastically well, but we moved Satya into that job. He was on a great path, and Qiâs hire made search as stronger, showed just how right Satya was. We talk about this in basketball. Is it all about team first or not? All about team first, which is essential. We were able to give them the additional experiences, which were super helpful in terms of him then taking over as CEO. David: Thatâs why Azure was turbocharging. Ben: All right. Listeners, we want to thank our newest sponsor and friend of the show that we are very excited about, Anthropic. David: Anthropic is the team behind Claude. Whether youâre running a business today or flying solo, Claude isnât just another AI tool. Itâs becoming the central operating system for how forward-thinking companies work. Ben: Listeners, thereâs something you should know. Claude actually helped us create this sponsor read. We fed it a few past sponsor reads as examples, and it came back with basically this before a little bit of tweaking from David and I. David: This itself is a pretty great demonstration of how Claude can be useful and took less time than running upstairs from my studio to grab coffee. Ben: What makes Claude different is the quality. It handles the hard stuff, writing and debugging code to build software, analyzing 100-page documents, managing complex multi-step projects, but more importantly, it does them well. Claude is designed to be more accurate, more trustworthy, and tasteful than any AI youâve ever tried. David: Think of Claude as that impossibly organized coworker, who knows every project, has read every document, and can find that email from six months ago. Ben: But hereâs the game changer. Claude connects to everythingâyour CRM, calendar, email, project tools, internal docs. Claude unifies them all into one place through something called MCP (Model Context Protocol), which everyone seems to be talking about this week. Claude can build any MCP connection you need. You just have to ask. Instead of juggling tools, Claude becomes your command center, pulling data from everywhere, spotting patterns across all your software, and surfacing insights that you would never find manually. David: Itâs super cool. Major companies are already seeing results from connecting all their systems. Snowflake uses Claude to answer key business questions with just English instead of writing SQL. Zoom feeds their meeting recordings into claw to automatically create summaries and action items, turning hour-long calls into clear next steps. Ben: If youâre ready to stop switching between tools and start using AI as your business hub, get started at claud.ai/acquired, and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. We want to talk a little bit about your post-Microsoft term, but letâs leave Microsoft with a final question of why did you resign? Steve: Two or three things. Number one, the phone was very on my brain. When you said, are you having fun? That was the thing that was eating at me the most, was the phone. I decided we needed to flip the model around. Your episodeâs pretty good about all that happened, so Iâm not going to go through all that. I knew we had to do hardware. I knew it. There was just no question. We werenât going to be able to play this Android/search game because we just didnât have the power of monetization that they did. Appleâs Apple, but theyâre going to be two phones. Itâs not like thereâd only be one phone that was popular in the world. This is something you guys didnât put in the episode. I had talked about buying a phone company for a number of years before the Nokia deal. I forget what year it was. I flew to Taiwan and we were looking at buying HTC. They were the biggest Windows phone OEM at the time. Nokia wasnât signed up. I finally just decided, Terry Myers and I, we had 3â4 trips to Taiwan to talk to Peter, look at the organization. I just decided it would be too tough to buy a Taiwanese company, that I would worry too much about the integration. I liked Peter Chou who ran HTC. I donât know if that name means anything to you guysâ¦ David: Yeah, of course. Steve: â¦but Iâd been looking at that thing for two or three years maybe before. Bill and I continued to have all the tension we had about anything that had hardware in it. Itâs not like our relationship was calm. Itâs clear. It had always been bumpy. Even back to the beginning, I almost quit after four weeks because we were in it. Five weeks, maybe. Itâs not like it had ever beenâ David: That wouldâve been a very poor economic decision. Steve: It had never been linear. We had another big fight a year after about financial stuff. It had never been linear. It had helped build Microsoft, but that didnât mean it had always been easy for him or me. The hardware thing was exacerbating our relationship. I thought we really needed to do a phone. Then the board said, no, we donât want to do a phone. I was very transparent with everybody. We brought the manager, you got this right. We brought the management team in. I donât know if it was more wanted to buy or didnât want, but I let everybody speak. Itâs a big decision to be in the phone hardware business. We do the presentation, and the process from there to the time the board says no, I didnât find very respectful. The board didnât ask me to leave. I just didnât find the process very respectful. I probably wonât go into the detail of that. And a lot of it has to do again with my relationship with Bill. I knew Bill didnât love the idea, and I was willing to accept whatever the board decided. I was, no question about that, but the process wasnât very good. I was not happy with the process, but they wanted me to stay. I just decided two things. If weâre not going to buy a phone, thatâs my best shot for a consumer future for the company. Right now, thatâs my best shot. I tried to fire the Yahoo shot, the phone shot. Those were my two things, remember? Mobile and search. I said, look. This might be the right time. We canât make my play here, not out of peak. Itâs just, hey, Iâd thought about this in advance and said, look. If it doesnât work, it doesnât work. If the board doesnât want to do it, fine. So I said, this is a good time. Itâs also a good time because the cloudâs just coming on. Iâm saying to myself, look. Weâre going to have to build new capabilities. Even the way weâre moving to a gross margin to something below 100% gross margin business. We have whole new capabilities. We need to build up around that. I even think of it through the lens of the accounting system. We had these revenue and cost reports. They have to change in the world of the cloud because you really have to get tight on gross margin not on revenue. I donât really pay much attention to Microsoftâs revenue. I pay attention to the gross margin growth. Ben: These days, youâre saying. Steve: Those days. When I said the move to the cloud, I used to say this to analysts, you should expect us, you want us to have lower gross margins going forward, but weâll make it up in volume. That is the whole process of the cloud. Lower gross margins. Itâs like Walmartâs an okay company even though that marginâs, whatever, 1.5%â2%. You just got to make it up in volume. I knew it was a good time to let the new person build from what we had to the next generation of all the machinery that would have to happen to make cloud happen. I never lost my desire to be an end user company. I bemoaned the fact that I couldnât keep us focused on being an end user company/consumer. It killed me. You donât just, ah, I want to be a consumer company. No, you got to find the locomotives, not just a bunch of cabooses. At the end of the day, Zune was a caboose. A lot of the things we invested in were cabooses. We had to find the locomotive. There were only two possible locomotives that made any sense. I didnât have a play that I thought was going to break through anytime soon in search. Mobile was going to be really hard. But I knew in my heart of hearts that without physical hardware, we werenât going to break through there either because of search. Board said no. I said, okay. Bill and I are, itâs not really the board being disrespectful. Maybe it is, but itâs mostly me and Bill grinding. And thatâs never fun when we grind. I say, okay, weâre grinding. I know itâs frustrating for him. Itâs frustrating for me. Weâre grinding. Here goes my idea. Oh, by the way, this is a great juncture point. I said, okay, Iâll pass. Then the board changed its mind. Ben: So why did they end up buying Nokia then after your decision was final? You were out. Steve: Oh, I donât know. Ben: Maybe you donât know. Steve: I donât really know. Iâm not sure they really understood, but I had told them about we had a deep partnership with Nokia and Iâm not really sure maybe guys really understood. I hadnât done a good job explaining how close the partnership was. There was really no, go back to Nokia and see if we can have a bigger partnership. The problem with the partnership with Nokia is they didnât have the money to invest in marketing. We did. They did not have the ability to go deep pockets. We did. But if we didnât have the monetization capability back through the phone, we werenât going to be able to make it work as a partnership because we had to put in the cash and therefore we had to get the return, and it wasnât going to work. David: It reached to a point where you had to buy the company or just cut bait totally on the whole thing. Steve: Yeah, just because the math wouldnât work. What we had to do to be successful was beyond their financial capacity. But if we were going to do what it took to be successful, we couldnât do it on $4 [...] Ben: You needed the margin dollars from the hardware too. Steve: Exactly. David: So you left. You did a pretty incredible thing, or really you didnât do an incredible thing. You held everything. Youâre still the largest individual shareholder in Microsoft. Steve: I think I might be. Other than index funds, the largest institutional investor too. David: And basically besides Vanguard. Steve: Iâm not sure about that part, but yeah, it could be. David: On the one hand I imagine it was very simple and youâve given reasons on other interviews in the past, youâre a loyal guy, et cetera. Just talk us through the emotions thinking about that. I imagine that was not so simple. Steve: No. I leave, then what does it mean to emotionally detach? Because if youâre not there, you have to emotionally detach. You canât say because you donât, you canât control anything anymore. Itâs hard. You donât want to stay quite that emotionally attached because itâs like, oh, I got to get back in and fix everything. But I said, Iâm going to be the best investor. Weâre going to know everything about this company. Iâm going to read everything just like I used to. Weâre going to go to conferences just like we used to. I went to one shareholder meeting and I was a dick in my opinion. Literally one of the shareholder meetings. I was too emotionally attached. Took me about a year to say I just have to emotionally detach. It took some work, but I was able to get there. But Iâm still loyal. Didnât want to sell. Thereâs one. Then we get our philanthropy started and then I do need to do something. We do need some of the asset value to give away. I went through a bit where we gave some away, i.e., we put it into our donor advised fund. I also sold a little bit at the time and I was thinkingâ Ben: This is 2015-ish? Steve: Yeah. It might have been even 2016, something like that. Then because our philanthropy was just ramping up. Connie had been giving away money, but the dollar value was ramping up. Then I said, maybe I should just sell it all. Full emotional detachment. Letâs do full emotional detachment. Because look. It was my baby. Itâs my baby. Iâm not a founder, but I think of myself as a founder. I was there so early and I hired basically everybody. Everybody was a senior leader Iâd recruited. Itâs not true anymore. Now things have changed. Itâs probably only 10% of the people who were there now were there when I was there or something. Higher at the senior levels. I can go through the math and why thatâs true. David: But that wouldâve been a very understandable decision of, you know? Itâs time to just put it all away. Steve: Just emotional detachment. It had nothing to do with money. My only thought process was emotional detachment. I was wrestling. David: Youâre ready to hit the button. Youâre ready to hit theâ Steve: It was wrestling. I was wrestling. Then the lady who works here, ex-Microsoftee who works here in finance, whoâs the woman who really charts whatâs going on financially at Microsoft, she and her boss, whoâs another ex-Microsoftee who used to work with me most closely on the financial stuff, but she says, you canât sell. You canât sell. This is going to be worth a lot more. You canât sell. You canât. Ben: So she effectively made a Microsoft stock pick. Steve: And she was recommending. She has some loyalty too. Itâs not like we have a bunch of Microsoftees here, and itâs not like they lack loyalty either, but it was a little bit loyalty and a lot a pick. I said, look. My loyalty trumps my emotional attachment. I can get through my emotional attachment, but my loyalty. And look. I think of the thing as like a two-headed hydra. I thought about this the whole way. Things could go to nothing or things could explode. Thatâs partly why we tamped on the stock, because we always saw the possibility for either of two radically different outcomes. Then finally I say, look. Iâm not going to sweat whether weâre going to get the downside or the upside. Iâm just going to be loyal and Iâm going to be enough emotionally detached for this to be okay. Ben: Because for you it doesnât matter. Thereâs not a downside that could be so bad that actuallyâ Steve: No, I had enough money off the table that ah, itâs not like my familyâs going toâ Ben: Could still run one of the best philanthropies of all time, even if the stockâ Steve: Connie wouldâve been okay with it. She finds it difficult to give away as much money as we have. She wouldnât have mind a smaller problem to start with. She wouldâve been okay. Ben: Iâve been charting it over the last three years. You guys are giving away almost somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars a year. Steve: Cash out the door. Ben: But your net worth is ballooning every year way faster than you can give money away because of the Microsoft hold. Steve: Yeah, Microsoft hold, but you may be missing one thing on the Microsoft hold thatâs important. And thatâs the size of the dividend check. Ben: Ah. Steve: Between Microsoft and the other stuff I own, the dividend checks are pretty close to what we give away. You can look at the appreciation, but weâre just above the dividend checks now. David: Youâre just trying to shovel the money that is coming in the door, out the door. Ben: So you can fund the whole philanthropy without selling additional shares. Steve: Well, there are two things that are going on. One, the dividend checks are pretty good. And number two, I do have stuff thatâs not in Microsoft. Ben: So you hold, I think mostly index funds outside of the Clippers, is that right? Steve: Yeah, Clippers/Arena index funds. I have one business I invested in with a guy who I went to college with who worked at Microsoft. Itâs called Stagwell Media. Itâs a marketing services company. Call it a modern day ad agency, but itâs not really an ad agency. A guy named Mark Penn. I do have some money thatâs not in index funds, but mostly Iâm in index funds. David: Which that anybody else in the same couple of top pages of lists that youâre on, you must be the only one that operates like this. Everybody else, huge family offices, lots of investments, private equity funds. Steve: Yeah, but I would say probably would find that Zuckerberg is pretty concentrated. I donât know this, but Iâm going to guess you would find, I donât know about Ellison, but obviously some of the guys who own more privately-held businesses pretty concentrated. Ben: Required to be concentrated. Steve: Yeah. Who else? The Google guys I imagine are concentrated, but I donât know that, I canât speak for anybody else. Obviously, Bloomberg is concentrated. David: Well, I think in practice it all works out the same way of, thereâs one thing that is everything. Steve: Yeah. And look. If you sell it, youâre just going to pay capital gains taxes. If youâre really just being a financial monster about it, you got to decide, will Microsoft underperform the index by enough to offset the capital gains taxes. I donât need the money. I got plenty to live on without selling anything. Thatâs number one. Financially, whereâs that money going to go? Some will go to my kids, but most of itâs going to go to the government or to philanthropy. Why would I sell, so we have less to give to philanthropy someday, unless I really think Microsoftâs going to underperform the market by essentially the capital gains rate. Ben: I feel like Iâm watching a live USA facts video right here. Steve: I got this question once. Iâm a member of a country club in LA, and one of the things country clubs do sometimes is theyâll do Q&A with members to entertain. I did a Q&A with a friend of mine at the club whoâd been president of the club, actually, and also as a knows Charlie Munger pretty well. Charlie Mungerâs there as well. Charlie Munger comes up to him beforehand. And to me. I know Charlie through Bill and Warren, and says, if you call on me, I have a question, David: As only Charlie can. Steve: You did a Charlie episode. We do our panel thing, the two of us, and then Q&A. Charlie gets up to the mic, heâs not moving super well, but he gets up to the mic and, oh, Charlie. We can call on you. Charlie says, Steve, Iâm wondering why you held onto your Microsoft stock when your partners over there didnât. I know youâre not that smart. Steve: I said, no, Charlie, but Iâm not loyal. I donât know why Paul and Bill didnât hang on. I donât know. Youâd have to ask them. But for me itâs from the heart thing. And I think itâd be fine. Itâs not going to screw anything up financially. Whatâs the worst thing that happens? Microsoft goes to zero? Probably not, but even if Microsoft goes to zero, me and my family, we can live, we can give away money, itâs not going to go to zero. And Iâm okay any way it goes. Iâm fine. Ben: And are the Clippers and the Intuit Dome fully paid off at this point? Steve: The Clippers are fully paid off. I paid them off the day I bought them. Thatâs not true. I didnât want to sell stocks at the time, so I borrowed some money, which is long paid off. Intuit Dome, we borrowed some money against Intuit Dome. I donât owe any money on it. Oh, thatâs not true. I owe some. I have some margin debt that I use to, but again, itâs just a timing thing. I didnât want to sell stock, so took some margin debt, which as dividends come in, Iâm reducing the margin debt. But the building itself has debt on it. Why? Because to sell the building, letâs say something was to happen to me and Connie (my wife) had to sell, the buyer would have to come up with less cash because it has debt on it. Call it worth X billion and itâs got Y billion on debt on it. Youâre only selling it for X minus Y. Youâre not selling it for X. Meaning the universe of buyers is bigger because it has debt on it. Oh, by the way, I happen to get the debt at a very good time, at a very good rate. Itâs a double value to a future buyer. Thatâs the reason we put that on the building. The margin debt was just a timing issue, if you will. Ben: I feel like weâve done you a great disservice by going into the Clippers and Intuit Dome throughâ Steve: The financial lens. Steve: Now, that I do not own the financial purposes. And I will also tell you, unlike Microsoft, it cannot go to zero. David: Like the asset value? Steve: Not a chance. It is far more secure than Microsoft. Why? David: Not making more of them. Steve: Theyâre not making more of them, and as long as anybody in the worldâs getting richer, the buyer pool will only go up. People donât buy them for their earnings. I wish we had more earnings, but at the end of the day, people are buying them because almost more like a piece of art. Some people donât like negative cash flow, blah-blah-blah, but at the end of the day, I have the Clippers, we have the best market in the world. If you want to want to own a basketball team, other than maybe Miami, the only place players want to play is LA. If youâre a buyer, where do you want to go if you donât live in LA? Where do you want to go? Well, you want to go to LA or you want to go to Miami. You donât want to go to New York in the wintertime. If youâre a foreign buyer, potentiallym, you want to go to LA. That asset valueâwe should get onto something other asset valueâIâm not selling the thing. My estate may sell it. I donât know what Connie and the kids will want, but at the end of the day, that one does not have a lot of volatility. David: Itâs a nice retirement fund. Whatâs been the most surprising thing in your Clippers journey? Steve: Iâll give you two parts of the answer. First is how I relate to that business versus the businesses Iâve known. Number one, there are more similarities than I ever thought. We do version upgrades just like you do. Whatâs a version upgrade? You do major version upgrades over the summer. Thatâs the draft and free agency and trades. And you do a minor version upgrade at the time of the trade deadline. Itâs very simple. David: You got a six month ship cycle. Ben: Your service pack. Steve: A major pack, minor release every year. David: SP1 and SP2. Steve: And oh, by the way, how people like agile now development, guess what? Thatâs called changing the game plan per the coaches are always modifying in that sense. Itâs a little bit similar. Ah, I never thought about that. The business is just like Microsoft. We sell both advertising and thatâs called sponsorship. We sell tickets. David: Software licenses. SteveOh, no. Thatâs only software licenses. We have an OEM business thatâs called broadcast revenue. Itâs 100%. David: Remarkably similar. Steve: Just the terms of business model. We do have a union. Thatâs very different. What that means in terms of the complexity through the collective bargaining agreement, it also covers things like whatâs max salary, what trades can you make, all that very different. You actually really are business partners with your competitors. Thatâs different. You actually get together and talk to them. I never did that when I was at Microsoft. Youâre get together and you talk to them, but youâre trying to compete. If you have somebody who wants to advance through their career, oftentimes the best way for them to advance, they have to go to another team. We have a president of basketball. Itâs not an open job. I donât plan for it to be an open job. I donât want to lose anybody. But if a lot of the career moves people make would be to other organizations. We donât like that. But we want to have the talent. Everybody loves. David: Microsoft, your domain is always growing. Steve: The domain is growing, or number of people, you can move people. Oh, youâre an engineer. Youâre bored. Youâve worked on X. Weâll move you to work on a different product, for example. Itâs different the way you think about people, primarily because of the union, but also there are only 30 head coaching jobs. There just are. If somebody wants to be a head coach and theyâre not our head coach, they have to find a job someplace else. Again, not what we want, but the reality is we donât want people held back in their career. Itâs not like Microsoft where I felt like I could always find a job that somebody should want. Thatâs different. Iâll give you another one to think about. Business likes to say, oh, weâre accountable, weâre agile, weâre this, weâre that. Sports is so much more accountable than business. Itâs like a joke. Iâm being a bit extreme for fun. But every 24 seconds, you get a report card. Basketball shot clock every 48 minutes. You canât say, Iâm going to make it up next quarter. We missed, but I got it next quarter. No. You lost that game, that game is on, you lost comp for the rest of the season. You cannot dig yourself out of that one game loss hole. You canât. Itâs gone. David: And you can probably also be reasonably confident about each individualâs contribution to that win or loss. Steve: Now let me get to that. Your customers know everything you know. Itâs not like you could say back in the lab, you wait until you see what we got in the lab. No. Every statistic we have, our customers have. You want to know how many miles James Harden ran last game? Comes out of the statistical systems. You can find that out. If you want to know how many pick and rolls we ran of a certain type, how they were guarded, and how we did scoring against them? Donât worry, you can read about it. You want to look and see what the dynamics look like on the sidelines? You can just sit there and watch our players and say, oh, I donât know everything. I donât know what theyâre saying, but I can see their body language. Oh, so and so seemed severely charged up. Oh, thatâs great. So and so cheers for their teammates. So and so seemed down. Thereâs almost nothing. We get to watch practice, our fans donât. But the level of accountability is so high. The speed is high. Think of teamwork. Teamwork, man. Itâs all on display. Not only is it on display, but you absolutely know you need teamwork. One star canât bail you out. You may have one star, but then the pieces have to fit around the star. Itâs just the way it is. You know how businesses, you say, okay. Everybody wants to talk about teamwork. In a lot of places that would mean, hey Ben, I donât know. We could work better on this. Then Ben can say, your teamâs doing things wrong. Then we can get back together and talk a little more. Then a month later we can talk about it some more. Probably youâve seen this in some organizations. Ben: And then at some point, weâll talk about it as if it were a great collaboration between our two teams. Steve: And what has to happen in our business? David: You actually got to pass the ball. Steve: You have to actually say it, pass the ball. Or hey, this isnât working. You got to do X. You got to give real time feedback. You canât lolly gag. Ah, well letâs rub each otherâs belly. No. If you want that team to be better, you have to hold one another accountable. Not just the coach. The best teams, the players hold each other accountable, and not just the best player holds everybody else accountable. Everybodyâs got to hold everybody accountable, which really means give the feedback. In Microsoft, we got rid of the value called teamwork. I didnât want that one. I said open and respectful and dedicated to making others better, because teamwork could sound like a treat. Everybody nice, nice. Open? Yes. Got to say whatâs on your mind. Respectful? Yes. But number one, dedicated to making each other better, which I think is what the purpose of teamwork is, as opposed to the word teamwork. Ben: Oh, thatâs interesting. Teamwork is an implementation detail, but thatâs not actually the goal. We donât seek to have an organization full of teamwork. Itâs teamwork because we want some output. Steve: Exactly. I think back to the old HP, Iâm okay, youâre okay. Letâs all be nice to each other. Thereâs a little bit of that thatâs come back into the general narrative of culture today, generations much younger than me. But at the end of the day, if you want to succeed, youâre right. The goal is succeeding. Play well together. In the NBA team, youâre going to know in 2Â½ hours or so, 2 hours, youâre going to know. David: Itâs interesting. Professional sports is maybe like the last bastion of thereâs not room for the Iâm okay, youâre okay, letâs talk this out. Oh, your teamâs talk to my team. Itâs extreme accountability. Steve: Extreme accountability, extreme teamwork. I learned some things that wouldâve been very helpful for me to understand at Microsoft. Iâll give you another one. Reference checking. Everybody does reference checking. How good is the reference checking in most businesses? David: Not good. Ben: Most people call front of sheet references, which has never made sense to me. Steve: Or you call somebody who probably doesnât feel like they can give you an honest answer because they donât want to get sued or blah-blah-blah. Basketball? You should see the amount of reference material we have on a guy before we draft them. People have talked to their old coaches, theyâve talked to their teammates. Thatâs what scouts do. Theyâve watched them play, theyâve been to practices, they know what theyâve talked to references about work at. Ben: Imagine if you could scout your future employees. You could just go hang out at their current job. Steve: Or you talk to their parents. There are so many things. David: The draft choices are such a crucible decision because free agency, you mostly know what youâre getting. They have a body of work. Steve: You can see the body of work. You may know what happens behind the scenes. You may not. David: So thereâs some risk to it, but thereâs a body of work. A draft, you get two choices every year. Steve: Well, we traded some away, but yes. David: But in theory. In aggregate, every team gets two choices every year, and you could choose to deal those choices. And thatâs hugely, hugely impactful. Steve: And youâre dealing with one other thingâmy wife reminds meâboysâ brains donât fully develop until theyâre what, 25? Weâre drafting guys who are 19, 20, 21. Youâre also having to say by everything I know, what do I project that guy looks like? You could say you enter your prime around 27, what do you start looking at though? Youâre going to look pretty good or not by 23, 24, 25. You have to have a progression of what you think happens to the young man when you draft him. The more reference checking, much bigger deal I found. People say, oh, well itâs simple. Itâs sports. The strategy decks I get, 35 PowerPoints, 40 PowerPoints, easily to go through. Okay, hereâs our strategies. What about this? What if? What about this. What do we do here? We have a PhD physicist who is a key part of our analytics group, focuses on our analytics systems. Itâs not like this stuffâs not complicated. It is. Ben: Analytics has become this really big buzzword in sports. Where do you see real alpha actually happening in data science and sports, versus whatâs just table stakes at this point? Steve: There are two ways to use analytics. One is for game planning. Literally, what does this tell us about the best way to guard Anthony Edwards in this situation or these situations? Very helpful for that. Iâd say the data is probably table stakes, honestly. The way you use it, not so much do you ask the right questions? Maybe not. Does coach really understand and embrace? Are the analytics people really able to mind meld with coach so that coaches get the insights they can for game planning? The second is, what about for drafting and trading? Analytics are actually a little less important in that instance. Because they donât really tell you how, if you mix Charlie with Harry, itâs different than if you mix Charlie with Bobby. And Charlie and Harry havenât played together before. So itâs a little different, and they are helpful. We have analytics, for example, and all the kids weâre going to draft, less valuable than on pros because youâre playing against a different level of competition. Do people have differential data? Not much. The same cameras in the ceiling are recording the same games. Most of the analytics data now gets processed through standard software packages that get licensed to everybody. Thereâs a company called Hawkeye Second Spectrum. Basically, theyâve built machine learning layers on top of the raw motion data, et cetera, so every team winds up with the same tools. Doesnât mean you donât need smart guys. It doesnât mean you donât do analysis on top of it. Ben: Has anyone had a breakthrough form of measurement? Is there an example in the last five years of a team thatâs had a great data source emerge? Steve: A different data source than other people have? No, I donât think so at all. Itâs the things people emphasize in terms of what they look at could be different (I think) very much by teams. Theyâre teams at the draft who just have you take a psychological test, you get to interview a set of kids and they might just have you take a test. Other teams, itâs all about the interview. Some people, I donât know if they see psychologists. I donât know. But people will use different techniques to try to do some of that. Itâs a little different from analytics, but it gives you the sense of how do you assess whatâs important. Ben: Fascinating, David: Interesting. How does Intuit Dome fit into all this? Steve: I love Intuit Dome. Since we talked a lot about products, and Iâve been involved in (Iâll say) the visioningâI call myself a visionaryâwhat should this product look like, particularly a number of them, both Windows but also certainly on the backend productsâbackend meaning theyâre not customer visibleâIâd say Intuit Domeâs probably the product for which I had the clearest vision Iâve ever had. I knew what I wanted. It evolved some because we went and looked at a bunch of other arenas. But I had a point of view. I know what user I wanted to make happy. Ben: So I bet a lot of people arenât familiar what is the thesis behind Intuit Dome? Steve: I wanted to make Intuit Dome the best place for the hardcore basketball fan. Ben: And particularly the hardcore Clippers fan, right? Steve: Sure, of course, because weâre the only team that plays there. David: Youâve got another team who plays there every night. Youâre visiting team, but not trying to help them. Steve: Yes, Clipper fans, but weâre going to have the Olympics. Weâll have every Olympic basketball game. And Intuit, I want it to be great for those environments. We have some college games or high school games in there. Basketball, basketball, basketball. You sit in there and youâre a fan. Itâs a live event. Got to have energy, got to have intensity. If youâre a basketball fan, come on, letâs go. So you want it tight. You want to have it reverberating with people who are cheering. Essentially, a whole side of the building is structured more like a college gym. Long and steep, there are no suites on the side. We even built a student section right in the middle. Itâs standing room only. You must stand. Thatâs what you have to agree to if youâre going to be there. You have to agree to stand. You have to agree to cheer. If you donât, weâll find you another place in the building to sit. You canât wear visiting gear paraphernalia on that whole side. Four thousand seats. Will move you if otherwise. Itâs small. Not the number of seats is a little small, but the way we pulled it together, thereâs no hockey. I didnât want hockey. Not that hockeyâs not a great sport, butâ David: Compromises youâd have to make to the arena. Steve: You have to spread it out. You have to spread people out because the rink is bigger than the court. Very different. We have an acre of scoreboard. David: The halo board is unreal. Steve: More statistics. We went 4K from the start. David: I didnât realize itâs an acre. You have an acre of scoreboard. Steve: Between the inside and the outside, itâs almost an acre. Ben: Itâs the largest indoor screen in the world. Steve: For sure. Ben: And what you were describing before is the wall. For any fans or listeners who havenât seen a game there or seen anythingâweâve done interviews about thisâitâs an unbrokenâ Steve: Fifty-one rows, unbroken all the way up. I call it the student section. We call it the swell, Clippers, waves, get it? Swell. The swell is right in the middle. They do a chant before the game starts. Theyâre chanting, theyâre making noise, a bunch will find weird things they want to bring to games. Funny posters. You basically sign up, first-come-first-serve. If youâre not there early, youâre not in the swell, that game. We oversell the section. Itâs $1000 for the year, which is only $25 a game. Hell of a price. Youâre expected to deliver the goods. You have to deliver. David: You got to bring the value. Steve: You got to bring the value. Ben: And the thesis behind the wall, if Iâm understanding correctly, is it should be easy to be a Clipper player, but hard to be an opposing player. Steve: We put it right on top of the visitor side, so it makes noise right into the visitorâs huddle. We put the swell right behind the backboard, so basically when youâre shooting free throws on that end, youâre looking right at the swell. David: And it makes a difference. Ben:. I saw data that said that theâ Steve: Lowest free throw shooting percentage of the league for the visiting team is against the wall. It worked. Thatâs what I wanted. David: What did the other owners think about this? Steve: Weâve had a bunch of people come through and look at the building. Would I be surprised if a number of the new arenas get built donât have a wall. No, I would be, or at least, student section. David: Youâve got a duration of your advantage because not every other team can build or remodel an arena. Steve: But you also have to remember, I took some financial hits on this. We have fewer suites, less revenue, and we only charge $1000 for a season ticket that gets you pretty close to the floor. Ben: And you didnât have any public funding for it, so in terms of the cash outâ Steve: Yeah. California, you canât have public funding for arenas. Thatâs why we donât. Ben: You paid for the whole arena and youâre going to have slower payback on that because you have less revenue opportunity. Steve: But we took a revenue. Definitely we could have made more revenue on that side if weâd done things a little bit differently. But itâs about basketball. We have a lot of toilets. Ben: Three times the average or something like that. Steve: Something like that. Why? Itâs about basketball. Get out and get back into your seat. Donât miss the action. We started out with a lot more concession stands, and then we said, no, no. Letâs just do this completely frictionless. If you register your face, you just walk in, grab what you want and leave. If not, you could just tap your phone on the way in, grab your stuff and leave. Thereâs no checkout. We donât serve eclectic food. Little everything. Same thing everywhere. Why? We donât want you walking around having to look for your favorite food. No, youâre going to get the same great stuff everywhere. It turns out 85% of what gets bought is in five items anyway. Itâs a hamburger, itâs a hot dog, itâs nachos, chicken tenders. Iâm not remembering off the top of my head. David: Is part of the calculus of this for attracting players too? Steve: Sure. If you look at our backend spaces, like our practice facility, ooh la la. David: But Iâm thinking even if your opponentâs going to have a lower free throw shooting percentage in your home arenaâ¦ Steve: Sure. Players have said they think itâs really cool. And thatâs good. Thatâs good. Playersâ offices are also good, i.e., the training area, the practice area, our outdoor pool, sauna, and cold plunge, our weight room, our sports performance center. That stuff, all I would say, are pretty good as well. Very good. Weâve done a bunch of things. We have the best refs room (I think) in the league. We called the refs union and said, what do you guys need? The media area, we said, look. If weâre going to build a new arena, our visiting locker roomâs the best in the league. Best weight room. David: Thatâs your sales pitch to visiting stars. Steve: Exactly. We say, hey, we care, and we care about everybody. Then we make it about the basketball, in and out. Oh, whatâs our artwork? We have public art that is required, some of which is basketball-oriented. But our major piece of public art is a clipper ship whose masks are replicas of basketballs from around the world. Basketball, basketball, basketball. Our art inside the building? We have a high school basketball jersey from every high school in the state of California. It looks like art almost because Itâs nice colors on the wall. Basketball, man. Itâs about the basketball. Ben: This building feels like your personality into a physical structure, the competitiveness, the loyalty, the fixation on what mattersâ David: On the customer? Steve: Yeah, it is. Look, you know how oftentimes startups come about because the founder is in love with some topic and builds the product they wanted to use? I think that happens a lot. I donât think people start back and look at the market, they say, oh, I thinkâ¦ I think Zuckerberg did that, Bill did that, programming, everybody does it. Thatâs what you did. I didnât try to go out and survey. We could have designed for the, let me call it the contemporary audience. We wouldâve had more lounge space. We could have designed for what Iâd call traditional, long-term. Thatâs how I think about it. We could have designed in a lot of ways. I designed for me. In some large measure, guys like me. It turns out Clipper fans are a little bit like me, because some of them are long suffering. The team wasnât good there for a number of years. People are diehard, come up to you and say, Iâm 89, which really means they bought their season tickets in 1989. Theyâve been there and now weâve exploded in the last, whatever, 14 years. We havenât had a losing season. Ben: Hopefully a championship here at some point. David: When are you going to overtake the Lakers? Steve: There are battles in tech where you just have to be patient and long-term. Itâs weird to have a town with two teams. Our goal is to be long-term grinders on that. We want to beat them every time on the court. Itâs okay to have two popular teams. Los Angeles County, for gosh sakes, has the same number of people as the state of Ohio, pretty much. There are plenty of people to be fans. We donât want to be âlittle brother.â We donât want to be the team with a nice 20% market share. No. We want to get our fair share. Weâre never going to get 100%. The Lakers have tradition just like at Microsoft. Patient, long-term, hardcore approach. If we donât do that, no. The Lakers have the position. Theyâve earned it. They got a lot of championships. That donât mean weâre not going to keep coming and coming and coming. Ben: Steve, thank you so much. Steve: Thanks, man. Thanks, David. David: Thanks, Steve. Ben: Appreciate it. Ooh, David, that was fun. David: Yes, it was. Ben: Iâve always wanted to interview Steve Ballmer. In fact, when I was at Microsoft, I wasnât a podcaster then, but at the time I was such a junior employee. But man, there was a complicated landscape that Steve was navigating between the product set, between developer relevance, between the shifting landscape underneath him, and will Windows be the interesting bet to make going forward? personnel stuff, board stuff, eventually CEO transition. That is not a job I want. David: Itâs fun for us as a show, too. Obviously this is meaningful for you personally, but when we started the show in Seattle in 2015, the Microsoft transition, Steve, Satya, this is what was in the water. This is what we all talked about at Madrona or Seattle in the tech ecosystem. Ben: And itâs not clear that Microsoft was going to be this amazing juggernaut that it turned into. Obviously, Steve had planted some seeds in enterprise and what would become the juggernaut of Azure, but we were early in Satyaâs tenure when we started this show. Everyone had high hopes, he had started to transform the culture, but itâs come a long way. David: Steve knew how great Azure was going to be, but the rest of the world didnât yet. Ben: Yup. So fun. All right. Well listeners, a few things before we wrap. One, New York City.

It includes a detailed competitive assessment and analysis of key drivers, product development, market diversification, and development in unexplored regions. The global law enforcement software market is forecasted to rise significantly, increasing from USD 20.25 billion in 2025 to USD 32.96 billion by 2030 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% during this period. Enhanced government budgets and favorable policies are key factors accelerating this growth, as several governments prioritize smart policing initiatives to tackle rising crime rates, public safety concerns, and the need for transparency. These initiatives involve applying AI analytics, digital evidence management, and cloud record systems, leading to streamlined operations, improved decision-making, and enhanced community engagement. Despite these opportunities, reliance on outdated legacy systems presents a considerable restraint. Transitioning to modern platforms requires substantial time, technical skills, and financial investment, with integration complexity and expense likely to be major obstacles to the market's growth. Deployment Mode Insights The on-premises segment is projected to hold the largest market share in 2025. Law enforcement agencies favor on-premises software solutions for enhanced control, security, and adherence to data privacy regulations, particularly when handling sensitive information such as criminal records and personal details. This deployment method offers full ownership of IT infrastructure, ensuring data security within agency-controlled servers rather than on external cloud platforms. Regulatory mandates for local data hosting and in-house system management reinforce the adoption of on-premises solutions, promoting data protection and operational control.

Title: “No More Bears”: Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin Charging Toward $1 Million Milestone
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/no-more-bitcoin-bears-saylor-says/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T13:00:04Z

The current bearish wave seems to have significantly disrupted the bullish action of Bitcoin, which has forced the largest cryptocurrency asset to revisit downside targets like the $108,000 price mark. While this action has triggered speculations about a potential bear market phase, Michael Saylor’s latest statement suggests that this period of volatility could be laying the groundwork for a notable surge. Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has dropped a bombshell on the ongoing bearish period and the future price target for Bitcoin. During an interview on Bloomberg, the chairman declared that the bear market is not coming back and BTC’s price could rise to a million-dollar value. Saylor, who has long defended Bitcoin as the best digital gold substitute and ultimate store of value, thinks that the cryptocurrency is the cornerstone of the contemporary financial system. This status is being cemented by its increasing institutional adoption, tightening supply dynamics, and growing demand worldwide. In the interview shared by Trending Bitcoin, the chairman emphasized that the market has gone past the bearish phase, indicating that the market is entering a new era. During these moments of heightened volatility, Saylor believes that BTC is heading to $1 million if it does not fall to zero. The founder has attributed this anticipated price target to several key factors, especially in the political landscape. According to Saylor, BTC has secured notable support from US President Donald Trump, the Cabinet, Scott Bessent, Paul Atkins, among others, as the crypto king matures into a global reserve asset. As BTC gains mainstream recognition, Saylor is confident that banks, particularly in the US, will eventually start to custody Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin has gone through its riskiest period, and the accounting has been corrected. BTC’s supply continues to shrink, with only 450 BTC available for sale each day by natural sellers, also regarded as minors. When these coins are bought at a rapid rate, demand for BTC is likely to increase, and its price will grow sharply. Institutions are significantly demonstrating interest in BTC as they set out to add the asset to their treasuries. Saylor revealed that these big firms, such as BlackRock, are acquiring a huge portion of the daily natural supply of BTC. Considering these factors, Saylor remains confident that BTC’s price is moving higher, hitting between $500,000 and $1 million. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy,” the founder added. However, in the event of a bearish phase, he claims that BTC could crash to the $250,000 range. Saylor’s latest remarks reflect Strategy’s robust interest and conviction in BTC’s long-term potential. Despite the current waning price action, the firm continues to accumulate the asset at a rapid rate. The founder recently hinted at another potential buy this week, as he highlighted that Bitcoin is still on sale while sharing a chart of Strategy’s BTC holdings.

Title: I was a VP at BlackRock before I started my own company. I saw 2 types of people in finance that helped me decide to pivot careers.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-blockrock-vp-pivoted-from-finance-healthcare-lifeforce-ceo-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-09-01T12:40:02Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 40-year-old Dugal Bain-Kim, a former BlackRock executive who founded a longevity startup in 2021. It has been edited for length and clarity. My first job in finance was the lowest rung on the European equities team at BlackRock. I was young, had a full tank of energy, and was just generally excited to have moved from my home in Australia to London. I was pumped to be living in what felt like the center of the world, working in finance. There was a lot of energy that came from the novelty of being able to earn my first real paychecks, having serious conversations, and just going out and making the best of London outside work. Around my fourth year at BlackRock, I became a VP at the firm, making low six-digit pounds. It felt great. Making decent money was something that was genuinely important to me for my career. It is for a lot of people. But I started to notice a shift in my energy at work. I'd been focused on getting the promotion for a while, and I got it. Then there was a bit of a come-down. There always is, but it sort of turned more into a bit of a funk. As I thought about it, I noticed that there were some people in the office who you could tell genuinely loved working in finance. On the weekend, they read The Financial Times cover to cover, and they chatted to each other about financial statements in the cafeteria. You could just tell that they were doing what they were meant to be doing, and they got a lot of energy from it. Then you could see that there were other people who, even if they were still pretty good at their jobs, were forcing it. They were doing it from extrinsic motivation, not intrinsic motivation — extrinsic motivation being money, status, promotions, perks, whatever it might be. As I started to notice that distinction, I definitely saw myself fitting into the second category. Finance wasn't what I would be thinking about in my own time. It's not what I wanted to talk about with people. I also felt that, at least on the investment-management side, a lot of the time, you were sort of this expert observation group that looked at people in the field, building and running companies, and then judged whether they were doing a good job. In those conversations, I noticed myself getting more and more curious-slash-envious abound the people who were actually in the field. I was in my late 20s when I left finance. It was kind of a sweet spot in my career, where I'd gotten paid decently along the way, but my lifestyle hadn't expanded so much that I was tied to the paycheck. I realized that I wanted to be in a sector that gave me multiple ways to win in my career. Meaning that if I worked on something, I would still be proud of the work I've done at the end of my career, regardless of success or earnings. I also wanted to work on something I felt was net beneficial for society and problems that I felt were important, which is a very personal decision. I have a history of people very close to me having very serious health issues. It's been a dominant theme for my family: How do you navigate the healthcare system, how do you advocate for yourself, how do you get access to the things that people can get access to if they have a lot of money and connections? When I started reading about the first generation of digital health companies using technology platforms to solve that problem, it hit very close to home. In 2021, I founded Lifeforce, a longevity medical program. There was a little bit of fear at first. It's a little bit like skiing — when you're standing on the top of the mountain about to tip your skis over. But honestly, by that point, the greater fear had become the regret of not having tried. I'm really pleased with the decision. It was definitely the right move and the ideal place for me to be. I don't regret my time in finance. It gave me a really good foundation for thinking about companies, how to think about markets, and even how to think about the workplace — what that's like and how to navigate different office dynamics. For example, how do you present yourself to more senior people? How do you work with other colleagues? It was a very professional, high-performance training ground that I think was generally very good for me. I would totally be open to my daughters working in consulting or finance for at least a few years to start their careers. I think it would give them a valuable set of fundamentals that will be useful in so many other ways. But I would also counsel them to be open-minded about whether it's a long-term or short-term thing. Those years in the professional world also helped me find out how I'm wired to think about work and what motivates me. Not everyone wants to work in a deeply mission-driven organization that happens to align with the cause that's most important to them. Frankly, it's not actually how a lot of people are wired. There are a lot of people who can actually do really well based on extrinsic motivations. They can feel happy about that, and that's awesome. Good luck to them as well. Once you understand that, it starts to inform what sort of "athlete" you are and, therefore, where you should take your career. Jump to

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Title: 5 Common Health Mistakes That Cost Your Business Millions

ByJodie Cook, Senior Contributor. CEO health directly impacts corporate performance and earnings. Anthony Ng Monica highlights 5 common mistakes leaders make: relying on motivation, all-or-nothing thinking, neglecting planning, ignoring triggers, and seeking quick fixes. Prioritizing sustainable health habits is crucial for business success. Fit and healthy leaders make more money. But if you’re unfit, your business probably is too. CEO health problems are linked with lower corporate performance. Without peak health you’re less good at strategic decision-making, which directly correlates with revenue, profit, and happiness as a leader. Do you feel energised, strong and confident every day? Or is health and fitness something you believe you have to sacrifice for business success? Too many founders think business success comes at a price. But what if that’s not true? Anthony Ng Monica is the founder & CEO of Daily Body Coach, a performance-optimization coaching service for entrepreneurs and executives. A former tech founder with a successful exit, he now brings together elite certified coaches in training, nutrition, and psychology to help business leaders achieve peak performance. Designed to fit seamlessly into demanding lifestyles, the Daily Body Coach program empowers clients to become better leaders, healthier individuals, and more successful in business. From experience working with hundreds of business leaders, including founders of 7, 8 and 9-figure and publicly-traded companies, here are the 5 common health mistakes Ng Monica sees on repeat. “Push harder” screams the personal trainer. But it doesn’t work. It never does. Ng Monica takes a different approach. “The real trick is to identify what you genuinely enjoy, that fits seamlessly into your lifestyle,” he said. “Once you’ve done that, sticking with it becomes effortless and performance compounds.” If you need motivation, you’re doing it wrong. Pro athletes and people with incredible levels of health and fitness aren’t relying on willpower to get them out of bed and into the gym. Instead, it’s part of their identity. They have created habits around the identity of being someone who takes care of themselves. Once you do this, it becomes easier to be healthy than not to be. All-or-nothing thinking is common among entrepreneurs. Business situations are either total successes or complete failures. You’re either having the best day ever or you hit rock bottom, with little appreciation for incremental progress or nuance. The founders Ng Monica works with are no different, but he teaches a different way forward when it comes to health. “Founders already have busy schedules. The moment a founder’s routine breaks (which can be for travel, a date night, or business lunch), everything else follows,” he said. “Without an intentional plan, they’ll fall off. One day turns into five, they’ve been set back and it becomes a grind to get back at it.” One bad day shouldn’t mean everything unravels. You’re better than that. Instead of polarising health and fitness, find the sustainable middle ground where balance is key. “Progress isn’t about perfection. Avoid feeling the need to compensate. Just press ahead with the plan and don’t let a single bad day define your direction” You plan your business goals in quarterly increments. You measure the stats and have progress meetings. You’re always working towards goals. But why isn’t this the same for health? “One founder we work with used to return from every business trip five pounds heavier. But learning how to handle business travel helped him avoid that,” explained Ng Monica. “What we told him was simple. Skip the welcome snacks and plane food (it’s never good anyway). Make smarter choices at the airport.” You don’t need to make progress on your business trips. Just don’t regress. Plan your health like you plan your marketing campaigns. “Have back up plans on Uber Eats or Doordash that you can default to when you don’t have time,” advised Ng Monica. “It takes the same amount of time to eat something healthy versus unhealthy.” “We see a lot of clients want to ‘save calories’ when going out for dinner, so they start restricting their lunch,” explained Ng Monica. “But they arrive at the restaurant so hungry that they have a hard time being rational and making healthy choices. It’s like going to the grocery store while hungry.” This isn’t the plan. Instead of consistently missing your targets and never finding out why, get real. Listen to your body. Apply second order thinking to the structure of your day. If you skip breakfast, how will you feel at 2pm? If you don’t stock your fridge with healthy food, what’s going to happen when you pass a donut shop? It becomes obvious when you think about it. “There are so many companies in the health and fitness space,” said Ng Monica. “But most of what they share isn’t true or helpful.” Most of health and fitness comes down to four simple pillars: nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress. “Unscrupulous practitioners prey on knowledge gaps and weaknesses of people,” added Ng Monica. In business, there are no quick fixes. Everyone wants to get rich yesterday, but the truly rich built their wealth over a number of years. If you cut corners, your customers find out. If you look to score a quick buck, you’ll build a reputation for being dodgy. Health is the same. “Good consistently equals great,” said Ng Monica. “Every time you find a shortcut, you’ll pay for it later.” Don’t create debt for your future self. If you can build a six or seven figure company, you already did the difficult part. You can develop healthy habits in health and fitness. Avoid the six common mistakes costing leaders their company performance. Don’t fall for the motivation trap, find balance instead of operating at the extremes, and plan ahead for an easy existence. Know why you go off track, unlink food from emotions, and stop looking for hacks because they don’t exist. It’s never too soon to take this seriously.

Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on Arm, letting Snapdragon X PCs connect to Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you have a PC powered by a Snapdragon X processor, you can now connect it to your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset. Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on ARM PCs, giving users more flexibility when it comes to using a local Windows PC within virtual reality. It's not clear when Microsoft added support for PCs powered by Snapdragon X processors. The Mixed Reality Link listing in the Microsoft Store states that the app received an update on August 29, but there does not appear to be a change log. A Reddit post by user "Nicalay2" highlighted the new capability. Regardless of whether the feature is brand-new or rolled out previously, it's a nice addition to Mixed Reality Link. Microsoft has worked hard over the years to improve app compatibility for Windows 11 on Arm. Mixed Reality Link is an app that allows you to connect up to three virtual monitors to a supported Meta Quest headset. The app is still in preview and works with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. The app allows you to connect your PCs to your headset wirelessly or through a wired connection and creates a multi-monitor setup that's only visible to you. It's also possible to access a Windows 365 Cloud PC on a Meta Quest headset. Mixed Reality Link was seemingly limited to Intel and AMD-powered PCs until recently. Microsoft's support document for the app still lacks any mention of Snapdragon X PCs, such as the Surface Pro 11. But Reddit user "Nicalay2" was able to connect a Surface Pro powered by a Snapdragon X chip to Mixed Reality Link. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Meta Quest 3S is a next-gen VR headset that was designed to be affordable. It features a powerful chipset, comes with next-gen controllers, and supports the best Meta Quest games and apps. One of the main draws of the Meta Quest 3S is its price. Nicholas Sutrich, who leads VR coverage over at Android Central, said "the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous" when discussing the rumored pricing of the Meta Quest 3S. Those rumors turned out to be accurate, and the result was a "triumph", according to Sutrich. The Meta Quest 3S sets the standard for affordable VR, delivering much of the same experiences as its more expensive sibling, the Meta Quest 3. There are some tradeoffs, of course, such as the Meta Quest 3S having a narrower field of view and worse display, but Meta had to trim some features and specs to hit the $299.99 price point. I've reviewed VR headsets and covered the virtual reality space for years, dating back to the awkward days of the Gear VR. I've played the best Meta Quest games, interviewed game developers while battling in virtual reality, and am no stranger to streaming Xbox games through the cloud. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a special version of the headset with unique coloring and some bundled extras. It comes with a pre-installed Elite Strap ($70 value), an Xbox controller ($65 value), and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate ($60 value). The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only available for a limited time, but how long that time will be is unclear. Meta sold out of the Xbox Edition of the headset quickly but Best Buy still has stock. Considering the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is $100 more than the normal Meta Quest 3S, you get quite a bit extra for the extra cash. Sutrich called the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition the "best value in VR," and I agree. Our Executive Editor Jez Corden went hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. Corden said Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest 3S is "absolutely awesome" and broke down the partnership that made the device possible. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is an excellent bargain, but if you don't need an Xbox controller or want to grab a headset at a lower price, the standard Meta Quest 3S is available and is also a great option. "The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the best value you'll find in VR today. The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's $119 worth of stuff you're getting for free, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle." — Nicholas Sutrich ✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition 👉See at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. — Nicholas SutrichAndroid Central review ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition👉See at: Amazon 🔎Price check: $249 at Best Buy (Payment options, no game items) 🤔Alternate deal: Amazon ($394.53, 256GB, Batman: Arkham Shadow) Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum showed fresh buying pressure this week after reports that a major Bitcoin whale dramatically increased its Ether holdings, a move market watchers say could reshape short-term flows. According to reports, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin whales bought roughly 820,220 ETH over the course of two weeks, a haul valued at about $3.6 billion at current prices. The purchases were logged across multiple addresses and have drawn attention because they represent a large transfer of capital into Ether rather than Bitcoin. Traders say such concentrated accumulation can lift sentiment and draw other large holders into the market. Ethereum’s latest trading performance has mirrored the big move. At the time of reporting, ETH traded around $4,390, with a 24-hour trading volume of $39 billion and a market cap near $538 billion. 🐳 THIS OG BITCOIN WHALE HAS BOUGHT 820,224 ETH WORTH $3.6 BILLION IN JUST 2 WEEKS. HE DEFINITELY KNOWS SOMETHING 👀 pic.twitter.com/iG9Su2BGZE — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) August 31, 2025 The token was up 2% over the previous day. Those raw numbers underline that demand for Ether remains high even as some parts of the market pull back. Derivatives activity tells a more mixed story. Reported data shows derivatives volume fell 14% to $61 billion, while open interest climbed 2.90% to $60 billion. The OI Weighted metric declined -0.0007%, a small drop that indicates a minimal reduction in positioning strength. According to these movements, dealers comment that the market may be consolidating: less new trades but more positions held. Mixing technicals with on-chain data, current forecasts point to moderate upside. Based on the latest prediction, Ether is expected to rise 11% and reach $4,870 by October 1, 2025. Market sentiment is listed as Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index reads 46 (Fear). Over the last 30 days, ETH logged 47% green days and an 9% price volatility reading. Those indicators suggest a market that has room to run, but which still carries meaningful uncertainty. Analysts have offered a cautionary note. According to analyst Ted, ETH’s recent outperformance versus Bitcoin may pause for a brief retest around $4,000 as liquidity clusters are swept and traders reassess exposure. He points to order-book dynamics that often trigger a pullback before new upward moves — a pattern that has played out in prior rallies. $ETH has been holding up really well compared to BTC.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Want to avoid burnout? Just hire an 'executive function' coach
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/avoid-burnout-hire-executive-functioning-coach-adhd-white-collar-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-01T08:11:02Z
Full Content:
In 2022, Sage Quiamno was in her early 30s and a few months into a demanding DEI leadership role at Amazon when she hit a wall. Cycles of feeling overwhelmed, procrastination, and frantic catch-up were routinely stretching her already long workdays past the 12-hour mark. Burnout was on the horizon. She knew she needed to make a change, fast. Quiamno found the support she needed from a life coach with unconventional tactics. Unlike many coaches, who guide clients toward overarching personal or professional goals, Quiamno's coach — whom she came to call an "executive function coach" — focused on helping develop skills to better manage her thoughts, actions, and emotions, optimizing her time and energy. Instead of applying an organizational blueprint to her work life, her coach zoomed in on specific pain points like task management and procrastination, helping her build strategies to confront the habits and feelings that were getting in her way. Three years later, Quiamno, who is now 34 and living in Seattle, still meets one-on-one with her coach every other week, in addition to a monthly meeting with a group of other women who are also focused on honing their executive functioning. "This is a long-term investment," Quiamno tells me. Executive function is the blanket term for assorted cognitive skills that help with organization, focus, memory, and self-control. It's the toolkit that lets you plan a multistep project at work and then deliver it on deadline, or navigate conflict with a friend. Harvard researchers have called it the brain's "air traffic control system." Impaired executive function has historically been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. That's beginning to change. In the past few years, growing numbers of parents, teachers, and universities have enlisted executive function specialists to help stressed-out students get things done, regardless of whether those students have a psychiatric diagnosis. And now, anxious and overworked professionals are turning to the very same coaches to recoup some semblance of control — and a slew of workplace coaching companies, such as BetterUp and WorkSmart, have taken note and started folding "executive function" into their rhetoric. The trend underscores how, in our age of constant digital distractions, our attention spans and time-management skills just aren't what they used to be. It also points to much larger problems in the way we live and work today. Executive function coaching was virtually synonymous with ADHD when it entered the fore in the mid-2000s. It quickly showed promise. In a 2009 study published in the journal Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, college students with ADHD or impaired learning received one-on-one coaching for 10 weeks, focusing on building perseverance, motivation, impulse control, and other executive functioning challenges. Afterward, the students reported greater autonomy and goal achievement, reduced anxiety, and stronger self-regulation. It wasn't until much more recently that executive function coaching went mainstream. Jesse Ruderman, the executive functioning specialist for the University of Denver's Learning Effectiveness Program, tells me the university hired its first executive function coach in the spring of 2020 to support students who were struggling amid COVID lockdowns. Other higher-ed institutions, such as the University of Minnesota, George Mason University, and Oberlin College, have since implemented similar programs. The pandemic was a turning point for workers, too. J. Russell Ramsay, a clinical psychologist who's a cofounder of the University of Pennsylvania's Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program, explains that the COVID lockdowns heavily taxed many adults' executive functioning because they removed the "scaffolding" of structured workplace environments that helped designate start and end times. Many people who were previously "struggling but getting by" with undiagnosed ADHD suddenly found themselves unable to cope, Ramsay says. The pandemic also exposed executive functioning vulnerabilities in people who might not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD but "have many of the symptoms." Not coincidentally, the pandemic saw a major spike in the number of adults in the US diagnosed with ADHD and being prescribed medications to treat it. A 2024 JAMA study found that between April 2020 and March 2022, nonstimulant ADHD prescriptions jumped by 81% among 20- to 39-year-olds, while Adderall and other stimulants rose by 30%. A separate analysis found that between 2019 and 2023, medical claims for ADHD grew by 101% among 18- to 44-year-olds, 70% among 45- to 64-year-olds, and 60% among adults over 65. The end of lockdown did not, however, make people's struggles go away. Since joining the University of Denver as a coach in 2022, Ruderman reports seeing "significant" year-over-year increases in students seeking his help. He met with 391 unique students in the 2023-24 academic year; last year, that number leaped to 727. He attributes at least some of the jump to the TikTokification of mental health — specifically, a widening pool of content creators who focus on neurodiversity — which has made a lot more people familiar with concepts like executive function. Ruderman says he's had to shorten his appointment time slots to accommodate rising demand. A sudden expansion of executive functioning support for workers suggests the corporate world has seen a similar pattern. Kate Broeking, an executive-functioning-focused workplace coach in Seattle, says that in just the past year, she's noticed more employee assistance programs and coaching companies that explicitly address executive functioning. Some employers, such as Workday, Chevron, and WarnerMedia, are even making these services available to their entire staff as a workplace benefit. Broeking has seen an influx of individual clients in her own coaching practice as well. Why the continued surge in executive dysfunction? The short answer is that modern life is stretching everyone's mental capacity to the brink. The experts I spoke with point to the endless interruptions and cheap dopamine hits of our digital devices as one obvious culprit. Research suggests that the digital world can warp our perception of time, which would logically affect how well we manage it. All the while, the increase in ADHD diagnoses has made more people aware of what executive functioning is in the first place. "The term has become quite prevalent," Ruderman says, noting that people have begun talking about executive dysfunction on TikTok. That prevalence has fed broader self-recognition. "It's really easy to self-diagnose — to identify that one has perhaps some executive dysfunction," he adds. On top of everything else, the pandemic introduced a new age of employment uncertainty that has far from let up. In some key respects, it's only gotten worse. Over the past few years, common wisdom about how to achieve success and security has largely flown out the window. Highly educated domain experts, new MBA holders, and freshly minted Ivy League graduates are among the millions of Americans struggling to land jobs, and the country isn't even in a recession. The tech industry is now in its fourth consecutive year of sweeping layoffs across every level of the corporate hierarchy. Generative AI has destabilized entire white-collar career trajectories, already prompting some employers to reduce head count on the so-far unsubstantiated promise of human-caliber automation. All the while, students and workers face mounting pressure to accomplish more and better with less time and support. "Humans don't like uncertainty," Ramsay says, adding that people with executive functioning challenges tend to like it even less. That's because living with unpredictable focus and feelings can create a lot of self-doubt, which makes external ambiguity even tougher to tolerate. But a heightened sense of uncertainty can also inhibit executive function, even in those who otherwise thrive under pressure. In an era when an ever-increasing slew of distractors constantly threaten executive functioning in work and school — not to mention side hustles, extracurriculars, caregiving duties, and the basics of being human — this vicious cycle can be catastrophic for people's well-being. For employers, poor executive functioning can also be expensive. Chronic stress and feeling overwhelmed are known risk factors for burnout, which drives up sick leave and lowers engagement in workers. New research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the fallout adds up to $4,000 to $21,000 per employee each year — a $5 million annual price tag for the average 1,000-employee company in the US. And employee leaves of absence appear to have been on the rise. In a 2024 survey by AbsenceSoft, a leave-of-absence software provider, 57% of HR managers reported increased employee leave requests over the past year — the third year in a row that the majority reported an increase. While most workers cited illness or injury as the reason for their absence, nearly half named mental health challenges. Perhaps relatedly, a May 2025 analysis of Glassdoor postings found that employee discussions of burnout were at their highest since 2016, showing a 32% increase from last year. Many workers seem to be hanging on by a thread. Although anyone can fall prey to burnout, research suggests workers with ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders may be especially susceptible. Some companies made strides to bridge these gaps in the years leading up to the pandemic, designing targeted well-being programs that could function as reasonable accommodations for employees with relevant ADA-qualifying diagnoses. Broeking, the work coach in Seattle, led the charge in building Amazon's work wellness coaching program in 2018 before going on to help Microsoft and Google establish similar coaching programs of their own. These interventions were modeled on vocational rehabilitation programs — services designed to help workers with disabilities find and keep jobs — and focused largely on executive function skill-building to boost worker engagement and prevent medical leaves of absence. In larger companies, Broeking worked with as many as 300 employees a year. Workplace wellness initiatives, however, aren't a silver bullet. A 2024 article in Harvard Business Review pointed out that while nearly 85% of major US employers offered wellness programs, worker burnout showed no sign of slowing down. Among other reasons, the authors suggest that well-being programs fall short by focusing on individual outcomes instead of the organizational causes often at the root of employees' distress. Workers want work-life balance and flexibility, clear goals, and consistent metrics for charting progress; research shows that organizations see improved employee health and output when they implement structural changes that better support those needs. Although personalized executive functioning guidance isn't a cure-all, workers still stand to benefit from it. "It doesn't take too much to knock us off track, and executive functioning means knowing how to shield yourself from distractions," Ramsay says. He's writing a book in which he recommends that employers provide executive functioning support for all staff, which he argues would be an asset to everyone — not only those with official diagnoses. Coaching may prove especially handy for navigating the tides of change and uncertainty that now define many workers' reality. When Amazon rolled back DEI programming early this year, Quiamno — the former DEI leader and coaching client — found herself back at the drawing board for her professional road map. She knew she couldn't rely on an employer to steward her career development; she would have to do it herself. Quiamno, who now runs her own consulting business for women-led startups, credits coaching for helping her build the confidence to move forward. "With a one-on-one coach who knows your strengths and your blind spots, there's always something new to learn," she says. "It's an accountability mechanism — a commitment to myself and my growth as a leader." Kelli María Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and culture.

LATEST BLOG WhatsApp Chatbot Demo Video Updated On Aug 22, 2025 19 min to read Managing Instagram can feel endless. You create posts, reply to messages, engage with comments, and track results. Doing all this daily takes time that many small businesses and creators don’t have. This is where instagram marketing automation helps. It takes care of repetitive work like scheduling posts or replying to simple questions. That means more time to focus on creative ideas and building real connections with your audience. When you automate instagram marketing, you keep a consistent presence without burning out. It also helps you reach more people at the right time. Done right, automation becomes an assistant that works in the background while you focus on growth. In this guide, we’ll go through 10 practical strategies to get started. But first, it’s important to understand what automation means in the Instagram context. Instagram marketing automation means using tools to handle daily marketing tasks on Instagram without doing everything manually. This could be scheduling posts, sending auto-replies to DMs, or pulling regular analytics reports. Think of a small clothing brand owner. She spends hours posting photos, answering “Is this available in medium?” in DMs, and checking likes. With marketing automation instagram tools, her posts go live automatically at the best time, DMs get instant replies with product details, and a weekly report arrives in her inbox. She gains back hours each week while her customers still feel attended to. Automation does not replace creativity. It helps with consistency and scale. Your ideas still matter, but you no longer need to be online 24/7 to keep the account active. Understanding this foundation is important before diving into strategies. Next, we’ll see why relying only on manual Instagram work can hold you back and why automation is becoming necessary for growth. Managing Instagram by hand seems fine in the beginning. You post when you can, reply when you find time, and check results whenever possible. But as your account grows, this approach falls short. Consistency drops, replies slow down, and your audience starts losing interest. This is where automation makes the difference. Posting on time is one of the hardest parts of running Instagram. Missing the best time to post means fewer people see your content. With marketing automation instagram, posts can be scheduled for when your audience is most active. Example: A small fitness coach schedules morning workout tips to post at 7 a.m. daily. While she trains clients, her content still goes live right when her audience expects it. Followers expect quick replies to their questions. Long delays often mean lost interest or missed sales. Automation helps by sending instant DMs or auto-replies to common queries. Example: An online clothing store sets up automated instagram marketing to reply instantly with size guides and delivery timelines. Customers feel cared for, even outside business hours. Tracking results manually takes time and often gets skipped. Automation delivers reports directly, showing what’s working and what isn’t. Example: A local café receives weekly performance summaries in their inbox. They see which posts bring more walk-ins and adjust their promotions accordingly. Running sales or events on Instagram requires constant reminders. Automation ensures campaigns stay on track without daily manual follow-ups. Example: A beauty brand schedules promotional posts and reminders for a holiday discount week. Even if the team gets busy, the campaign runs smoothly online. Manual work limits how much you can grow. Automation makes that growth sustainable. It gives businesses the freedom to focus on creativity and customer experience while routine tasks run in the background. Next, we’ll look at 10 clear strategies to automate instagram marketing and apply these benefits step by step. Automation becomes powerful only when applied in the right ways. Instead of trying to do everything by hand, you can focus on the work that needs creativity and let automation take care of the rest. These strategies show how to automate instagram marketing step by step without losing authenticity. Posting on Instagram looks simple, but keeping it consistent is where most accounts struggle. Missing the right time or skipping days makes your content invisible to many followers. Consistency is the difference between slow growth and steady engagement. A fitness coach plans her content every Sunday. She creates seven posts, schedules them for 7 a.m. when her audience is most active, and spends the week training clients. Her Instagram stays active, and she doesn’t lose hours creating posts daily. By scheduling in advance, you make Instagram work for you, not the other way around. It builds a rhythm your audience can rely on while giving you freedom to focus on other parts of your work. Next, we’ll cover how to automate instagram marketing for Stories and Reels to stay visible daily without spending hours online. Stories and Reels drive more reach than regular posts. They keep you at the top of the feed and capture attention fast. The challenge is consistency. Posting them daily takes time, and skipping days hurts visibility. Automation solves this by keeping your Stories and Reels active without demanding constant effort. A bakery films behind-the-scenes clips of bread-making over one morning. Instead of posting them randomly, they schedule each clip as daily Stories across the week. At the same time, they queue Reels showing recipes and customer reviews. The account stays fresh and visible every day, even while the team is busy serving customers. Automating Stories and Reels keeps your brand in constant view. With a planned flow of content, you don’t lose reach on busy days, and your audience sees you as active and reliable. Next, we’ll move to direct engagement. Strategy 3 explains how to use automated instagram marketing for DMs so every follower gets a timely response. Direct messages are where followers often turn into customers. People ask about prices, availability, or services. Quick replies keep them engaged, while delays can cause missed opportunities. Handling every message manually takes time, especially as your account grows. This is where automated instagram marketing helps. An online clothing store gets dozens of DMs daily asking for sizes and shipping details. With automation, customers instantly receive answers with a link to the store’s FAQ page. The store owner only steps in for custom inquiries. This saves hours while keeping customers satisfied. By using automated DM replies, you stay responsive without being tied to your phone all day. Followers feel valued, and you spend more time on meaningful conversations instead of repeating the same answers. Comments are where conversations begin publicly. They boost visibility, encourage more followers to join in, and make your brand feel approachable. Yet, replying to every single comment manually can be overwhelming. That’s where you can automate your instagram marketing with comment automation. A coffee shop runs a post about a new drink. Many users comment “Looks amazing!” Instead of leaving them unanswered, automation replies with “Thanks ☕! Drop by this week and try it.” This boosts foot traffic and makes followers feel acknowledged. By using comment automation, you strike a balance between staying responsive and saving manual effort. Followers see that you’re active, and your posts stay buzzing with interaction, which the Instagram algorithm loves. Next, we’ll dive into a strategy to help your posts reach a wider audience without extra work. Hashtags act like signboards that direct people to your posts. They increase visibility, help you reach a wider audience, and bring new followers who are interested in your niche. The challenge? Finding the right hashtags daily can take up a lot of time. That’s why you should automate instagram marketing with hashtag research tools. Imagine a fitness coach posting daily workout clips. Instead of spending 30 minutes looking for hashtags like #fitnesstips or #homeworkout, automation suggests trending hashtags such as #fitin15 or #morningburn. This keeps content relevant, helps new audiences find it, and frees up time for creating videos. By automating hashtag research, you simplify discovery while boosting reach. It’s a small step that creates consistent growth without the stress of constant manual effort. Next, we’ll move on to a strategy where you keep your profile fresh without being online 24/7. Tracking numbers is not glamorous, but it’s what tells you whether your Instagram marketing is working or not. Manually checking likes, comments, shares, and reach takes a lot of time and often leaves you with scattered data. By using marketing automation Instagram tools, you can generate analytics reports automatically and focus on making smarter decisions. Suppose a fashion brand runs an influencer campaign. Instead of manually checking every post’s performance, they set up automated analytics. Each week, a report highlights which influencer posts drive the most clicks and sales. This allows them to double down on what’s working and save budget on what’s not. When you automate Instagram analytics, you make faster, data-driven decisions. It transforms your strategy from “post and pray” into a measurable system that shows real ROI. When you’re running a sale, product launch, or event, timing is everything. Many businesses lose potential customers simply because people forget the deadline or miss the offer announcement. With automated Instagram marketing, you can set up reminders that notify your audience about campaigns without having to send them manually every time. Imagine a skincare brand launching a new product line. They schedule automated Instagram stories leading up to the launch, paired with DMs reminding interested followers about early-bird discounts. As a result, sales spike on day one without the marketing team scrambling to post updates manually. When you automate your Instagram marketing with reminders, you don’t just boost visibility—you actively move people from interest to purchase at the right moment. Suggested Reading: How to Add Shop Button on Instagram (A Step-by-Step Guide) One of the most underrated benefits of Instagram marketing automation is the ability to automatically tag users based on their behavior. Manually sorting followers into categories like “hot leads,” “engaged fans,” or “casual followers” takes too much time. With auto-tagging, every comment, DM, or interaction can be tracked and organized for smarter campaigns. Suppose you run a fitness brand. Automation tags users who comment “Join” under your workout challenge post. These tagged leads then receive tailored DMs with challenge details, while casual followers continue seeing regular fitness tips. This way, you’re not spamming everyone, only nurturing those ready to act. By using Instagram marketing automation for tagging, your campaigns become sharper and more personal. Instead of treating all followers the same, you engage each group with what they care about most. Running Instagram ads is powerful, but it can easily burn through budgets if not monitored carefully. This is where marketing automation on Instagram steps in. By automating ad rules, budget allocation, and audience targeting, you ensure every dollar works harder without needing to babysit campaigns all day. Let’s say you run an eCommerce store. You create three ad sets for your new product launch. Instead of manually tracking each one, you set automation rules: any ad with more than 5% click-through rate gets more budget, while low-performing ads pause automatically. The system optimizes spend in real-time, ensuring you only pay for results. With marketing automation Instagram, you don’t just run ads—you run them smarter. Automation keeps campaigns lean, efficient, and consistently optimized for the highest ROI. Instagram automation doesn’t have to live in isolation. When you automate your Instagram marketing by connecting it with other business tools like CRM, email platforms, and chatbots, you create a complete ecosystem where data flows seamlessly. This means no lead slips through the cracks, and every interaction becomes part of a bigger, smarter workflow. Suppose you’re a fitness coach. A user comments on your Instagram post asking about your online training. Automation pushes their details into your CRM, sends them an automated email with a free consultation offer, and opens a chatbot conversation in Instagram DMs. Without lifting a finger, you’ve nurtured a lead across three channels. When you connect Instagram automation with other tools, you move from platform-specific automation to full workflow automation. This is where businesses truly scale, creating a synchronized system that saves time while increasing conversions. Instagram marketing automation helps you save time, stay consistent, and reach more people. Start small, add one strategy at a time, and grow with ease.” Automation can make Instagram manageable, but it should never replace the human side of your brand. Overuse can make your account feel robotic. Misusing tools can even risk account restrictions. The goal is to let automation handle repetitive tasks while you focus on creativity and connection. Here are the best practices to follow: People connect with brands that feel genuine. Automation is great for timing and consistency, but the content itself needs to reflect your voice. If every post feels automated, followers quickly lose interest. Automating everything may look efficient, but it creates distance between you and your audience. Relationships are built on real conversations, not canned responses. If every message sounds identical, people will feel they are talking to a bot. Instagram has strict rules around automation. Tools that violate these rules can lead to reduced reach or account suspension. Many third-party services promise instant followers or likes, but they often break guidelines. Automation keeps your account running, but personal involvement builds community. Followers notice when you reply directly, join their conversations, or acknowledge their support. That kind of interaction cannot be automated. When used carefully, automated instagram marketing acts like an assistant, not a replacement. It keeps your account consistent and efficient while you invest energy in creativity and relationships. This balance helps you scale safely, without losing authenticity or breaking rules. After learning about different ways to use automation, the next step is starting with a plan. Many businesses jump into tools without setting clear goals, and they end up with messy campaigns. To avoid this, you need a structured approach. Think of it like launching a new store: first, you decide what success means, then you pick the right tools, and finally, you expand as your business grows. The same applies to Instagram marketing automation. Define what you want from automation. Are you aiming for better engagement, higher sales, or stronger brand awareness? For example, a clothing brand may want to automate Instagram marketing to reply faster to DMs about stock availability. A coaching business may want scheduled posts to stay consistent. Writing these goals down will guide every step that follows. The tool you pick should fit your goals. Look for features like post scheduling, auto-replies to DMs, and performance analytics. This is where beginners often struggle—using one tool for posting and another for replies creates confusion. An all-in-one option like BotPenguin makes things simple. It handles automated DMs, detailed analytics, and even multi-channel marketing from one dashboard. For a startup or small business, this means fewer tools, less cost, and faster results. Begin with a single feature like post scheduling. Once you’re comfortable, add automated replies, then move to advanced features like lead tagging and campaign reminders. For instance, a local café could start by scheduling daily posts. Later, they can set up automated DMs to answer questions about timings or menu. With BotPenguin, you can scale like this without switching platforms, so the tool grows with your needs. Starting with automated Instagram marketing doesn’t have to be overwhelming. When you set clear goals, pick a beginner-friendly tool like BotPenguin, and expand step by step, automation becomes a natural part of your marketing. This foundation prepares you for long-term growth while keeping your campaigns organized. Instagram marketing gets easier when you have the right automation tool. BotPenguin helps you do more than send messages—it gives you full control over how you engage with followers. Whenever someone texts you, BotPenguin can send a welcome message, FAQs, or resource links automatically. This ensures no DM goes unanswered. Set keywords like “price” or “demo” and let BotPenguin send the right reply instantly. This saves time and improves conversions. Turn post comments into leads. If someone comments “interested”, BotPenguin can instantly send them a DM with more details. Reply to every comment—publicly or privately. Example: “How much is this?” → BotPenguin replies “We’ve sent you the pricing details in your inbox.” Automatically tag followers based on actions (DMs, keywords, comments). This helps you build smarter campaigns for warm leads vs. cold followers. See which replies, DMs, or campaigns are getting the most engagement. BotPenguin generates easy-to-read reports so you can measure ROI. Connect BotPenguin with your CRM, email, or other tools to create full customer workflows, not just Instagram replies. With BotPenguin, your Instagram account can reply, engage, and convert automatically while you focus on running the business.

Each tactic saves time, organizes campaigns, and creates more space for creativity and human connection. But remember, success doesn’t come from automation alone. Real growth happens when automated Instagram marketing supports your effort, not replaces it. Automated tools keep your brand consistent and responsive, while you bring the strategy, vision, and human touch that turns followers into loyal customers. If you’re ready to get started, choose a platform that makes automation easy without overwhelming you. Tools like BotPenguin give you everything in one place—smart replies, scheduling, analytics, and integrations—so you can focus on building connections while automation handles the rest. 🚀 Start small, grow step by step, and let automation be your marketing partner. Your Instagram can scale faster than you imagine when humans and automation work together. It allows small teams to keep their Instagram active without constant manual effort. Automation tools handle scheduling, replies, and tracking so owners can focus on serving customers. Yes. You can pre-plan posts, create automated DM flows, and set rules for ads. This makes seasonal offers or festival campaigns run smoothly, even if your team is busy. It is safe if you use trusted tools that follow Instagram’s policies. Look for platforms that provide human-like automation, avoid spamming, and work within Instagram’s limits. By setting up automated replies for FAQs, order updates, or lead capture. Customers get instant answers, while complex queries are smoothly handed over to humans. Brands can send interactive polls, drip campaigns via DMs, and create automated reminders for product drops or live events. This keeps followers engaged in unique ways. Because BotPenguin is beginner-friendly, affordable, and multi-channel. It manages DMs, analytics, and ad rules in one place, making it ideal for those starting automation safely.

Title: A former Microsoft worker has been job-hunting for 9 months. He says it feels like companies are 'looking for Superman.'

Time Published: 2025-09-01T07:46:02Z

Before he was fired last December, Mody Khan was earning a six-figure salary as a cloud solution architect at Microsoft. Nine months into his job search, he's at risk of losing his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. "I'm in a very tight spot." A new job could stabilize his finances — but despite a five-year run at Microsoft and his prior experience in the tech industry, even landing interviews has been challenging. "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman," he said. Khan is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've lost their jobs over the past year. In recent years, Big Tech firms — including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon — have revamped their performance review and compensation systems to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Then there are the layoffs. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also affected many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the beginning of this year, global tech companies have laid off more than 80,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have come amid a white-collar hiring slowdown. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," Khan said. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share about struggling to find work, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, at Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out this quick form. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Khan said that after immigrating to the US from Pakistan in 2007, he struggled to find high-paying work during the 2008 recession. But over time, his job prospects improved — and he held various tech roles before joining Microsoft in July 2019 as a contract support engineer. He became a full-time employee in May 2020, working as a support escalation engineer. In December 2021, he was promoted to cloud solution architect — a fully remote role he held until his termination in December 2024. Khan's final years at the company were very difficult. He said multiple managers raised concerns about his performance over the years and eventually warned him that his job was in jeopardy. While he made efforts to improve, he said that it didn't seem to make a difference — and that he believes his managers didn't give him the support he needed to succeed. He said he often lacked clear guidance on expectations and would have benefited from more constructive feedback and coaching. At times, he said, it felt like his managers were more focused on "building a case" against him than helping him improve. At one point, he told his wife that if he ever won even a small lottery jackpot, he'd walk away. The pressure had become too much. "I hated going from the bedroom to my home office," he said. "I was under so much stress." Last December, Khan learned he was being fired for performance reasons and wouldn't be receiving severance pay. He was told he could still apply for other roles at Microsoft — and said he later applied to as many as 30 internal positions — but never received an offer. Khan said he sold some of his Microsoft stock holdings but now has only about $10,000 in "survival money" left in his bank account — enough to last him and his wife about two more months. If that runs out, they'd be forced to tap into his remaining investments or 401(k). To make matters worse, they fell behind on their mortgage payments — and if they can't resume payments once their forbearance plan ends in November, they could face foreclosure. The financial toll has also caused his credit score to drop from the high 600s into the 500s in just a few months. Since expanding his search outside Microsoft, Khan has managed to land some interviews, he said, but no matter how well they seem to go, none have led to offers. "I've had so many good interviews where I'm ready for them to say, 'Mody, let's rock 'n' roll' — and then they don't move forward," he said. He added that it's particularly frustrating when seemingly promising conversations with recruiters don't end in a clear rejection — but in silence, leaving him unsure whether he was ever truly considered. "Recruiters contact me, take my résumé, and they ghost me," he said. Khan believes a few factors may be hindering his job search. He's concerned that some employers assume, because of his age, that he's not up to date on the latest technologies. He said that to push back on that perception, he completed an AI certification through the University of Texas. He added that many of his interviewers appeared to be looking for candidates with startup backgrounds, which made him feel like his experience at a tech giant was almost a strike against him. Additionally, he said he believes his Pakistani background has, at times, been an obstacle. He believes some Indian recruiters or interviewers may carry biases that surface during the hiring process, particularly given long-standing regional and political tensions between India and Pakistan. Khan said he continues to apply to roles every week, hoping that one will finally come through. But with the financial pressure mounting and his savings running low, he said the stakes are getting higher. "It's a very, very dangerous situation," he said. Jump to

The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. | Photo Credit: - Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares traded lower by 0.43 per cent at ₹1,351.30 on Monday morning at 11.30 am, despite announcing a joint venture with Meta to develop enterprise AI solutions for India. The stock opened at ₹1,356 and hit a day’s high of ₹1,357 before declining to ₹1,340.60. The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore ($100 million) in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. The joint venture will offer AI Platform-as-a-Service and pre-configured solutions targeting Indian enterprises and SMBs, with the transaction expected to close in Q4 2025. Brokerage firms maintained positive ratings on RIL following recent AGM announcements. JPMorgan retained its Overweight rating with a target price of ₹1,695, while Kotak maintained Add with ₹1,555 target. Jefferies and HSBC kept Buy ratings at ₹1,670 and ₹1,630 respectively. Nuvama maintained Buy with the highest target of ₹1,733. According to Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart, the stock decline reflects investor disappointment with the Jio IPO timeline being pushed to H1 2026, later than expected 2025 listing. He noted RIL’s historical pattern of post-AGM declines despite significant announcements. Key AGM highlights included the definitive Jio IPO timeline, launch of Reliance Intelligence subsidiary, and ambitious retail growth targets of 20 per cent CAGR over three years. The company reiterated plans to double EBITDA between FY2022-FY2027 and achieve ₹1 lakh crore FMCG revenue within five years. Analysts remain optimistic about RIL’s long-term prospects, citing its diversified business model and strategic investments in AI and new energy. The company’s New Energy business is expected to potentially match the scale of its O2C operations. Trading volume stood at 45.04 lakh shares worth ₹608.59 crore, with 59.48 per cent deliverable quantity indicating sustained investor interest despite the price decline.

Title: What's the price of a home in your area?

Aoife Ryan\u002DChristensen Brainstorm Analysis: Property prices are still rising, not just because of supply but because of wages, demographics and population size Property prices in Ireland continue to be on the rise. The latest Property Price Index figures from the Central Statistics Office show that prices increased by 7.8% overall (8.0% on houses and 6.6% on apartments) in the 12 months to June 2025. The figures also show prices have been going up every month for two years now. The figures use the median price rather than the average: this gives a more accurate picture because the median isn't skewed by extreme outliers in the figures. While the median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June 2025 was €370,000, there are big differences across the country: The highest median price for a home (house or apartment) in the 12 months to June 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The region with the highest median price was Dublin, with a median price of €486,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the median price was €675,000. The least expensive area within Dublin was Fingal, which had a median price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €450,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, which had a median price of €425,000. The least expensive region over the last 12 months was Leitrim, where the median price paid for a dwelling was €190,000.

This data shows the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000. Overall, the five most expensive Eircode areas by median price were in Dublin.

"Because for the last three years 95% of all new housing in Dublin, for example, has been apartments, and 95% of those have been for rent, what you're going to see is house price inflation outside, in the greater Dublin area and going further out to your Westmeaths and your Longfords and places like that," says Dr Lorcan Sirr, Senior Lecturer in TU Dublin and housing policy analyst. "You're going to see more of that as people move further away from the urban core to buy homes, because there's nothing to buy in in the large urban areas. It's the same in Cork but to a lesser extent. You're going to see house price inflation continue, because the drivers of house price inflation aren't just the number of houses. It's also things like wages. Then there's demographics, the population is going up."

"So there's a whole load of other factors aside from the actual number of houses that we have, that influence house prices - and none of those are going in the right direction [for house prices to come down]." "There's nothing there that indicates to me that house prices are going to come down," he says. "The other factor is, people forget that of all the houses we build every year, in the last four or five years, less than 30% of them actually come to your estate agent for you to go and buy. The rest of them are snapped up by the State, or one-off homes and so on. There’s less and less actual supply on the market." "I suspect what you'll find is price inflation gathering pace further and further away from urban cores, as people move because nobody wants to rent. Yet government policies are directed towards incentives to rent. It’s bizarre."

Title: AI Agents Are Already Reshaping Business Leadership And Decision Making

ByBernard Marr, Contributor. When it comes to the work that can be carried out by AI agents, we often focus on repetitive and routine tasks. The types of tasks that machines can get really, really good at if they perform them again and again. Examples include writing and scheduling social media posts, solving routine customer service issues, or labelling and categorizing unstructured data. In case you’re not up to speed, agents can be thought of as generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT but with virtual arms, legs and the ability to take action on our behalf. A slightly more technical definition is that they are large language models (like ChatGPT’s GPT-5 engine) capable of connecting with other tools, including web browsers, to carry out more complex and sophisticated tasks, with minimal human intervention. But it would be wrong to think that agentic AI is only useful for low-level, tactical decision-making on the shop floor; What time should you send an email newsletter? Or which piece of machinery needs maintenance work? In fact, it’s increasingly being used by business leadership to make strategic or management decisions. One McKinsey study recently found that 53 percent of C-suite executives and 44 percent of middle managers use GenAI at work, putting them well ahead of the total overall figure. So here, I’ll take a look at some of the ways that agents are already making their way into business management functions. I’ll also provide some tips for anyone who wants to make sure they’re prepared for the convergence of agents and business leadership. No one will expect the average CEO to be ready to hand over control of their company to a machine any time soon. But there are many theoretical and a growing number of real-world use cases for agents in leadership and high-level decision-making. One of the most visible is through integration with the decision support systems often used to augment human decision-making by ensuring we have the information and guidance we need. For example, luxury goods manufacturer LVMH recently announced its decision to build a platform that will use agents to monitor and surface signals so decision-makers can react more quickly. Asset managers BlackRock have developed their own agentic platform, called Asimov. Asimov can work through the night, gathering research data in real time, monitoring market activity and scanning company filings, ready to present an actionable report to executives in the morning. And Citi Group has talked about its plans to divert some of its $12 billion tech budget into agentic AI, which could be used to connect different business AI initiatives, improving strategic oversight. Enterprise software vendors like Microsoft and Salesforce are increasingly building agentic functionality into their tools, to assist decision-makers with strategic advice, or deploying their own agents. This means we’re likely to see agents being used in exciting new ways as adoption grows among leadership in different industries. For example, in healthcare, agents could be used to monitor and oversee an increasingly sprawling connected health infrastructure. This helps leaders understand what's generating value, what's being underused, and what’s just a waste of resources. And in manufacturing, agents can track production operations, supply chain effectiveness and energy efficiency, creating opportunities to make strategic plays. While agents aren’t yet taking the wheel on business decision-making, they’re increasingly in the passenger seat, ready to help us navigate or warn about trouble ahead. So if you’re a leader or a decision-maker, what steps should you be taking to make sure you aren't left behind? Business decision-makers who’ve already had experience with deploying generative AI will be at an advantage here. But agentic AI requires a different approach, more suited to the long-term strategic planning tasks agents are built for. Agents are more big-picture and goal-oriented, and your thinking should be too. While ChatGPT can draft you an email, an agentic platform like Manus or Operator can create an email marketing strategy and build the infrastructure to deliver it. At least, in theory, it can, but it has to be noted that early adopters of those tools frequently report that they don’t always get it right just yet. From a general usage point of view, it's important to remember that AI agents are not simply evolved AI chatbots. They’re not really designed to chat or knock ideas back and forward about the best way to create something, which is something ChatGPT is good at. Agentic AI can be expensive because the "thinking" chews through a lot of tokens. So it’s best to go in with a clear idea of what you want and instruct the agent explicitly on how you would like it to achieve it. One of the great strengths of agents is that they can use digital tools just like we can, from using a web browser to shop online to controlling complex industrial machinery. Preparation for this might involve ensuring that proprietary and legacy systems can be persuaded to play nicely with agents. Or making a commitment towards open-source technology, where standardization is common and popular tools are likely to be quickly patched to work with an agentic ecosystem. Next tip: to fulfil their full potential, agents will need access to fast streams of high-value, timely data via well-documented APIs. Organizations that don’t have their house in order here are likely to miss opportunities as they attempt to catch up. And, absolutely critically, leaders must take steps to ensure they understand the principles of secure, responsible and ethical AI use. As we take steps to give AI the power to make more decisions on our behalf, the need for guardrails, oversight and accountability is more important than ever. Will we get to a point where machines are so good at predicting the right course of action that humans just aren’t needed? Could we even become a liability? Well, maybe one day. It’s pretty hard to know where this technology will be in two or three years, let alone ten years. But one thing we do know is that human brains are still immensely more complex than the best artificial brains. That additional complexity allows us to understand nuanced situations, navigate complex interpersonal relationships and make complex, long-term, strategic plans in ways that computers probably won’t be able to do for some time. This means that human leaders probably aren’t ready to delegate their powers entirely just yet. Instead, they will look to agents to help them become better leaders and more effective decision-makers.

Title: BlackRock has finally come for our utilities

BlackRock has finally come for our utilities. Here’s this, from a new article by Katya Schwenk at Jacobin: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has its tentacles in all facets of American life. The behemoth is buying up grocery brands, dental practices, apartment buildings, and nursing homes. But the opaque industry of private equity has mostly stayed away from electric utilities, the regulated companies that supply power to homes and businesses, because they often don’t yield quick returns. That’s changing. Last year, the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and a Canadian pension fund announced a $6.2 billion deal to buy Minnesota Power…. That deal faced tremendous pushback, and is not yet official, but here’s where things get really conspiratorial: after a judge issued a heavyhanded ruling against the acquisition, unions and “clean energy” advocacy organizations have come out of the woodwork to support the BlackRock takeover—Schwenk writes that when the proposed deal was announced, BlackRock executives “put the climate transition at the center of their pitch.” The “clean energy” groups with their “climate crisis” boogeyman strike again. Schwenk also uncovers some rather incestuous connections too: In at least one instance, union comments bear the fingerprints of an attorney working for BlackRock, document metadata shows. And: One of these [clean energy] groups is currently advertising a benefit event sponsored by Minnesota Power and the law firm representing BlackRock in the deal. And, it’s not just BlackRock. Another big player on Wall Street, Blackstone, is also in on the game, which recently announced its plans to acquire “a major electric utility in Texas and New Mexico” if permitted to do so. So why are these global investment firms turning their attention to our energy suppliers? Well, because the AI demand is set to drastically drive up energy consumption, and in a world of wind turbines and solar panels, that energy is going to be expensive. From Occupy Wall Street to “Don’t touch my globalist corporate overlord and his profits!”, leftists have a dizzying intellect (if it can even be called that). They really are the useful idiots we keep accusing them of being. Image from Grok. BlackRock has finally come for our utilities.

Title: ROSEN, GLOBAL INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

Full Content:
August 31, 2025 22:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Trip.com Hits ‘25 Nasdaq High As China Travel Recovery Lifts Profit

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Shares in Trip.com, the online travel site that has emerged as one of the China’s most successful private sector start-ups in the past quarter century, climbed to their highest Nasdaq close of 2025 on Thursday after the company said growth in bookings in the April-June quarter lifted revenue and profit. Trip.com closed at $75.03 at the Nasdaq on Thursday – its best since December, before falling back by 1.7% on Friday. Its U.S.-traded shares were still more than 13% higher than a week earlier, and have gained nearly 60% in the past year. In Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading, Trip.com closed up by 4.7% on Friday to HK$578, also its highest finish since December. Trip.com, then known as Ctrip, was founded in 1999 as a disruptor in China’s travel services industry, entering at a time when the field was dominated by offline state-owned companies. Beginning with hotel rooms, it began an Expedia-like online expansion into airline tickets, corporate travel services and even railway tickets. From its $250,000 in start-up capital, Trip.com’s market capitalization at the Nasdaq was $48 billion on Friday. That compares with $26 billion for Expedia. Trip.com said on Wednesday net revenue in the second quarter of 2025 rose by 16% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, helped by stronger travel demand, particularly during holidays. Accommodation reservation revenue for the second quarter rose by more than a fifth to $869 million, it said. Inbound travel bookings surged by more than 100% year-over-year, while outbound hotel and air ticket bookings topped 120% of the pre-COVID level for the same period in 2019. Those gains helped to lift net profit by more than a quarter to $676 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to company figures. "Our strategy focuses on capturing growing demand from every demographic, with special attention to inbound travel,” CEO Jane Sun said in a statement. Sun ranked No. 16 on a list of China’s top businesswomen published by Forbes China earlier this year. The company’s co-founders include billionaire venture capitalist Neil Shen, currently the founding and managing partner of HongShan (formerly known as Sequoia China), and Ji Qi, chairman of U.S. listed hotel company H World. Trip.com holds stakes in a number of hotels and resorts, including Atour, whose Nasdaq-traded shares have more then doubled in the past year. Shareholders include Chinese search engine Baidu, which owns about 7% of Trip.com and funds associated with BlackRock, 5.3%. Trip.com over the years has built up a network of more than 1.7 million hotels and flights from over 600 airlines, according to company figures. The site is available in 24 languages and offers 35 local currencies, Trip.com says. Trip.com shares trade at a forward price-earnings multiple of 20, compared with 15 for Expedia, according to media estimates. Expedia’s rises to 27 when you take out “extra items,” per Reuters. One European country notably looking forward to welcoming more Chinese tourists: Italy. Milano Cortina will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, and winter sports have become increasingly popular in China since Beijing hosted in the winter games in 2022.

Title: The crash of 2026: a fiction
URL: https://crookedtimber.org/2025/08/31/the-crash-of-2026-a-fiction/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T21:39:55Z
Full Content:
by John Q on August 31, 2025 Looking at the facts, there’s no reasonable conclusion except that US democracy is done for. But rather than face facts, I’m turning to fiction. So, here’s a story about the collapse of Trumpism, crony capitalism and the AI/crypto bubble. Fiction is a relatively unfamilar mode of writing for me, so critique (on style and structure rather than plausibility) is most welcome. The crash of 2026 began with a literal crash. A Tesla robotaxi operating on an open highway for the first time, inexplicably swerved into the path of oncoming traffic. Coming in the other direction was a Cybertruck whose driver, relying on self-driving capabilities, was busy checking his investments on the phone. His instant death spared him from the knowledge of his impending bankruptcy. Tragically, a school bus was following, and its brakes failed (the school district later blamed budget cuts for inadequate maintenance) The driver did her best to steer around the wreckage but the bus overturned and burst into flames. By the time the smoke cleared, there were six deaths, including the busdriver and two children, as well as the occupants of both Teslas. More then 30 schoolchildren were taken to hospital. The images of death and disaster ran on TV and social media for weeks. The reaction was swift. By the end of the day, Tesla’s robotaxis had been taken off the road throughout the US, and demands for retribution were everywhere. Several Tesla dealerships were torched and others closed down. The situation wasn’t helped by a bizarre tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to suggest that the bus driver was a “crisis actor”. By the time Wall Street opened the next day, the financial analysts had done their sums. The legal liability for the disaster would run into billions, enough to wipe out most of Tesla’s cash reserves. And with the robotaxi business gone, there was nothing to conceal the truth of Tesla’s situation: a company with declining sales and margins trading at more than 100 times its current earnings. With the prospect of massive short sales at the opening bell, trading in Tesla shares was suspended. This was bad news for Musk, who faced margin calls and the loss of his holdings in X and SpaceX, both secured by his ownership of 16 per cent of Tesla. But as usual in such cases, he got off easily. Musk turned up soon afterwards on a Caribbean island he had bought through a shell company years previously, along with the government of the nation that supposedly ruled it. No longer the richest man in the world, and theoretically bankrupt, he nonetheless enjoyed the comforts of a mansion and a super-yacht, each with its fleet of servants. The situation was rather different for the owners of the other 84 per cent of Tesla, who collectively faced the loss of nearly a trillion dollars. Those with diversified holdings and no debt took the loss philosophically, as an offset against the massive profits of recent years. But others, who had borrowed to buy both Tesla and crypto assets like Bitcoin, faced disaster, especially when rumors spread that Tesla was about to dump its own massive Bitcoin holding. The price of Bitcoin fell 25 per cent overnight. Longstanding HODLers were not concerned, reminding themselves that Bitcoin had fallen many times before, and had always rebounded. But now that crypto-currencies were embedded into the financial system, there were plenty of players with a shorter-term perspective. They started talking to economists, who almost universally agreed that crypto-currencies were inherently worthless. Traders who had gone all in on crypto suddenly saw the merits of profit taking. Regulators, who had been quiet since the passage of the GENIUS Act, started asking questions. The real disaster came with the exposure of large-scale fraud at Tether, the most prominent of the stablecoins, which were supposed to trade at exactly $1 US. As the volume of investors seeking to quit crypto increased, it emerged that the supposedly ironclad asset backing of Tether had been undermined by a complex web of derivative transactions, allegedly the doing of a “rogue trader”. Once Tether “broke the buck” the run was on in earnest. Wall Street banks found that that they had significant direct exposure to crypto and even more through their counterparties. They went into lockdown, calling in whatever debts they could. The realisation that the multi-trillion dollar valuations of Tesla and Bitcoin had been spun out of thin air led to a harder look at Wall Street’s “Magnificent Seven” now reduced to six. Claims that AI was about to generate massive wealth if only more billions were invested looked silly. Investment in data centers stopped abruptly. Nvidia was the first casualty. Once orders for chips from the hyperscalers dried up, its business was over. The advertising businesses of Google and Meta, and the Amazon retail business, went next. There would be no growth in sales of consumer goods for some time to come. Microsoft and Apple, with real businesses and products, fared better, but their values, based on hyperbolic price-earnings ratios, fell drastically. Crowds of ruined investors, milling in the streets, became violent, and were suppressed by heavily armed and masked thugs, presumed to be ICE, with several deaths. Increasingly violent protests and even more violent suppression followed. At this point, a global financial crisis similar to that of 2008 was now inevitable. There were loud calls for an internationally co-ordinated response. But such co-ordination, already inadequate in 2008, was non-existent this time. Fed Chair Kevin Hassett, appointed by Trump after the removal of Jerome Powell, couldn’t even get his global counterparts to pick up the phone. With less direct exposure to the crisis, other countries sought to protect themselves, imposing exchange controls, and preventing repatriation of funds to the US. Crypto trading was banned in many jurisdictions, and holders of crypto were required to report their positions to regulators. Taken collectively, these disasters threatened to wipe out the entire wealth of the Trump family. Naturally, Trump struck back, announcing the discovery that trillions of dollars in US foreign debt was fraudulent, and would be expropriated. The remaining US public debt, following the plans previously announced by Stephen Miran (chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers) would be forcibly converted into 100 year bonds, at rates to be set by the US. The EU and Canada reacted by freezing US-owned assets. Trading on major stock exchanges around the world was suspended. At this point, global capitalism seemed doomed, along with democracy. But somehow things turned around. With their donors facing ruin, dozens of Republican Representatives and Senators switched sides, throwing control of Congress to the Democrats, who immediately announced impeachment proceedings against Trump. Trump called on JD Vance to expel the traitors from the Senate, but, sensing the ground shifting, Vance temporised. Trump attempted to declare martial law, but was forestalled by Vance and the Cabinet, who invoked the 25th Amendment to remove him. At Trump’s urging, a MAGA mob, including dozens of the masked gunmen now ubiquitous on American streets, marched on the Capitol, planning a repeat of 2020. But this time they were met by the army, with fixed bayonets and machine-gun emplacements. After a brief exchange of fire, the crowd fled, leaving dozens of dead and wounded behind. The Vance Administration lasted only a few days. After seeking assurances that he would not face prosecution, Vance resigned in favor of Jerome Powell, who had been hastily appointed as Vice-President and was seen as the technocrat most likely to restore faith in the US, The fallout was rapid. Facing impeachment and likely criminal charges of corruption, Supreme Court justices Thomas and Alito resigned, while Gorsuch and Kavanaugh decided that their appointments had been improper all along. The five remaining members of the court unanimously overturned the previous finding of Trump’s presidential immunity, and discovered that participation in the January 6 insurrection was in fact treasonous. Facing this catastrophic defeat, MAGA fragmented. A minority of Trump’s supporters genuinely repented of the disaster they had brought on their country and became zealous defenders of democracy. Another group pointed to the feeble statements they had made criticising Trump and tried, with varying degrees of success, to maintain a role in public life. Some of the MAGA base gave up on politics altogether, suddenly discovering that Trump was just as corrupt as the Democrats he had railed against. Others remained loyal to their fallen leader. Republican state governments collapsed as the party fragmented. Trump’s trial proceeded rapidly this time, and he was sentenced to spend his remaining days in prison, along with many of his cronies. There were some scattered insurrections which were rapidly put down, with their participants held in the various detention centres conveniently created by Trump. Now, in early 2028, the world economy is gradually climbing out of the pit created by the crisis. The financial sector, a shadow of its former self, remains largely nationalised, and the disastrous losses in the crypto sector have yet to be resolved. But AI technologies, now in the public domain after the collapse of the hyperscalars. have started deliver significant (though not stratospheric) productivity benefits. Continued declines in the cost of solar power and battery storage have dispelled concerns about shortages of electricity, and have supported new investments in rewiring the economy in the US and other countries. The reconstruction of the US political system will take much longer. President Powell, virtually assured of re-election, has proposed a constitutional convention that would replace the failed two-party system. The first step, already implemented in most states, has been a shift to instant runoff voting in Congressional elections, along with the scrapping of the primary system. But a shift to full-scale proportional representation is expected, with the former Republican party splintering, and socialists gaining significant support in cities and even some rural areas. There is, as Adam Smith observed, a great deal of ruin in a nation. It will take decades for Americans to repair all the damage done by their experiment with fascism. But America has huge resources, both human and natural, and (at least in this fictional account) the traditions of democracy are finally reasserting themselves. { 34 comments… read them below or add one } Alex SL 08.31.25 at 10:55 pm That is a very nice narrative, and it is obvious that a large financial crash is coming. If it is frightening enough to Republicans, it may well end Trump’s administration. Unfortunately, it is otherwise all too optimistic. Among the fundamental constants of the last few decades that have got the USA into this mess are: First, there are never any consequences for powerful and rich people. The only way to see consequences for a powerful and rich person is if they first lose their wealth; that is why Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, and Bernie Madoff ended up in prison but Adam Neumann, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump never did, because the former lost their wealth, and the latter did not. God forbid that a billionaire or, for that matter, a former president ever sees repercussions like the little people for breaking laws or doing a war crime. No matter how bad an economic crash, the people who caused it will not feel any consequences. This culture of shielding the powerful and rich at all costs also means that no, the supreme court justices will not resign. That idea is unthinkable to them, as it is to the vast majority of Americans. There is no solution to this problem except a deep cultural change where the American public at large sees billionaires, elected officials, and judges as deserving more accountability than a weed dealer or a shoplifter, because, as the comic book hero goes, with great power comes great responsibility. And I don’t see that happening overnight. Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal. None of that is going to happen in my lifetime. So, within a few years the goldfish-like memories of the voters will just bring MAGA back under a different name and with a different leader. Third, the Democrats are utterly useless. Even if brought back into power (and it would have to be them, as president Powell is much less likely than president Vance putting Powell back into the Fed to restore faith), they will not implement the reforms outlined in the second-to-last paragraph. They are in their happy place fund-raising and handing that money over to consultants who tell them to go further to the right and seek bipartisan solutions on ethnic cleansing oh sorry immigration. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Democratic party of centrists, and given the realities of primaries, the byzantine campaign donation systems, and the hilariously undemocratic intra-party governance of the USA, that isn’t ever going to happen. I would love for a better outcome, but realistically, the choice is between (1) fascism and (2) a few years of hapless centrists not solving any of the structural issues that lead to fascism, followed by fascism. Cheryl Rofer 08.31.25 at 11:19 pm This is very good. Thank you, John! John Hamilton Farr 08.31.25 at 11:59 pm Damn that’s good… John Q 09.01.25 at 12:14 am @Alex You’ll notice that all the leading figures except Trump (along with unnamed cronies) get off scot-free. It’s fiction, not fantasy. Seekonk 09.01.25 at 12:29 am Brilliant! Rich 09.01.25 at 1:14 am Too optimistic! Where is the dystopia? Where are the zombies? John Q 09.01.25 at 2:14 am Rich @6 There’s not much point in fiction about a dystopia when you’re already in one. And there’s loads of financial zombies, not to mention Zombie Economics Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 3:46 am Well thought out and well done, Mr. Quiggan. I raised an eyebrow over the collapse of crypto, but its likely once money guys get scared enough to look. I raised the other eyebrow at the popping of the AI bubble, but again, a good scare might do it. But when the Republicans went along with Vance giving up the White House, I was out of eyebrows. Republicans willingly surrendering Trump is entirely believeable in this scenario, but giving up power by giving up Vance? This is not our Republican party. The screams from Fox and the Freedom Caucus would deafen the world, and this would be the moment Vance and Theil have been planning for years. Vance might be forced out by a Democratic party that grew a continental-sized spine, but it would be a bloody fight. Dan Strong 09.01.25 at 6:44 am I’m with Alex SL on this one – I enjoyed the story, but it did strike me as hopelessly rosy-eyed. It’s hard to swallow the suggestion that there are, in fact, limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump. Not to mention the idea that the sclerotic Democratics would be able or willing to effectively exploit a political crisis of the right. John Q 09.01.25 at 8:18 am Dan @9 Did you read the opening para of the post ? Mike Huben 09.01.25 at 12:49 pm The most improbable thing (to me) is the resignation of the Supreme Court justices. If anything, resigning would make them even more vulnerable. Not to mention that the right-wing corruption would continue to bribe them, now to stay in office. Dave 09.01.25 at 1:37 pm I believe this will all happen exactly as described, but over a few decades instead of years. nastywoman 09.01.25 at 2:18 pm SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! – and we play with most of it already on our game of WOR(L)D DOMINATION with the UTMOST BEAUTIFUL ADDITIONAL SINK of NEW YORK and CALIFORNIA going FULL SOCIALIST (in any Americans Mind) and doing completely their OWN FUN SINK (as Elon would) say – why Elon is currently -actually far, faaar too involved in his WAR against the UK and Germany that he put the US kind of on PAUSE. YES SIR!!! Harry 09.01.25 at 2:41 pm “Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing” It is a cult, but it is a personality cult. Once Trump is out of the way it will fragment, as personality cults often do. This may not be as optimistic as it sounds — there are a lot of very people in the cult who are unstable, angry, and armed. And maybe someone can pull together another personality cult composed of some of the fragments, plus other dangerous forces. I can’t think who, but then in 2014 I had no idea a Trump could. Gwyneth Paltrow? Jerry Brown 09.01.25 at 4:07 pm It has the elements of a story. There are an awful lot of villains and at least some of them get their just rewards. The protagonists need some development. Maybe some more work developing Powell as a reluctant hero. And you have to change the names of course. And sex sells so you want some in there somehow with this bunch. Maybe think George Clooney as the Powell character on the verge of being fired for some Trumped up charge on the eve of the traffic accident. And he gets saved by some unlikely heroine somewhere in the judicial system. Maybe like a fictional Amy Coney Barret type who sees through the Trumped up charges and decides to act in the interest of justice for a change. Stranger things have happened. Laban 09.01.25 at 4:50 pm “a repeat of 2020” You mean a guy in a buffalo head dress being escorted through the Capitol by officers ? I seem to remember far worse unpleasantness in the name of George Floyd, which people seemed quite pleased about. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house I think the dollar is unlikely to still be the reserve currency by 2100, unless by some miracle the United States can be re-industrialised. I think that’s what he’s trying to do, however imperfectly, but he only has 3.5 years and a nation divided in many ways who have watched living standards fall for decades . China has a high-IQ, hardworking* population which is far less multicultural, and living standards and morale are on the up. It’s not that I’ll welcome our new Chinese overlords. Anyone working in the tourist industry will tell you Americans are much more generous. the point of the Chinese Exclusion Act was basically – “these guys work too hard for too little”. Michael Cain 09.01.25 at 5:57 pm I wouldn’t be so sure that the regular military would respond quickly to a President Vance’s order — based on a 25th Amendment takeover — to deploy and fire on American civilians. Trump has been replacing a lot of high-level officers based on what looks like a loyalty requirement. It seems possible that we would instead get a demonstration of “This is why the Founders didn’t want a standing army.” JimV 09.01.25 at 6:30 pm What I’ve heard recently about MAGA (and believed) is that about 37% of the people in the USA (and maybe elsewhere but with different focuses) are mean sociopaths or worse who enjoy Trump exactly for all the evil things he does, and are going to be with us always, some of them billionaires. So even if things do get better, they will get worse again, and the story, which I enjoyed, has some fantasy in it. (I enjoy good fantasy.) Robert J Berger 09.01.25 at 8:14 pm Loved it, wish it comes true. (the later part with Trump and his Minions in Jail and the country comes to its senses, hopefully we can avoid total economic destruction) Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 10:55 pm But those soldiers were chosen for loyalty to Trump personally. With Trump out of the picture where do their sympathies land? Questions like this abound throughout the (optimistic) scenario here, and is why the honest reality-adjacent answer is “nobody knows”. There’s a list of authoritarian personality cults to compare, with a range of outcomes (as I read somewhere) from The People’s Temple to Scientology. Can Vance be David Miscavige? Man has devoted himself to presenting as an empty suit, so who knows. J-D 09.02.25 at 12:15 am Alex SL’s reaction on finding John Quiggin’s story implausible is to make suggestions which are much less plausible. Alex SL 09.02.25 at 12:30 am Harry, These people existed before a Trump candidacy was a twinkle in anybody’s eye. For many decades now, they became school board members to push for creationism, they have worked towards filling the judiciary with Federalist Society hacks, they have carefully built a vast radicalisation machine ranging from local radio across Fox News to Youtube influencers, they have effectively infinity bribe money for elections at their disposal and an entire network of think tanks to influence elected officials, all with the aim of transforming the USA into a white-dominated plutocracy with the civil rights of, at best, the late 19th century. (I think they would not re-introduce racial chattel slavery… probably… but many of the libertarians among them would likely be okay with indentured servitude, as they think that any contract is ethical and acceptable if it is entered into without literally having a gun held to one’s head; they don’t count “if you don’t do this, you will starve to death” as coercion, and the only freedom they care about is that of the wealthy to do as they please with their wealth.) Do you think these people will go away or conclude that they are now in favour of liberal democracy, a welfare state, scientific expertise, and gay marriage once Trump is gone? This authoritarian movement didn’t start with Trump. It merely coalesced around him. It has completely taken over the Republican party. It will stay, and it will come back electorally even if they lose the next two elections, which would in turn depend on ICE not standing guard in front of most polling places to, ahem, “maintain order”. It would take a generational effort to discredit this movement, and there is no sign that any significant, organised counter-movement exists to undertake that effort. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:11 am Oof. John, I thought I was pessimistic. Capital controls, expropriation, oof. Not saying you’re wrong. I moved my 401k entirely out of US investment and into European ones. But they’re still housed in a US brokerage, so haha, subject to expropriation and capital controls. Sigh. Goddamn FATCA and FBAR. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:24 am Dan @ 9: I would answer differently from John Q. I also -fear- that there are no “limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump”. None at all. In that case, this ends in one of two other ways: civil war in America America collapses and the rest of the world walls it off and goes its own way B/c they’re speed-running the destruction of the systems that keep America working. When those systems fall apart, either the G(r)OPers turn (John Q’s scenario), or there’s civil war, or America descends into some sort of hell. I say this to my European, Asian, and elsewhere friends: plan on a world without America. Plan on it. Hell, plan on a world in which America is your enemy. I’ve lived in America since I was four years old. I’m the sort of American who hasn’t left the country since 2007 (work trip). I spent 3yr in France on a postdoc. Besides that and a few trips for work, I’ve never left the country. I’m -that- sort of American: stay-at-home. A week ago, I booked travel to France to start re-learning French and look around for a place to emigrate to. Maybe it won’t be France. But it’s coming. I regret not having done it in early 2025; it’s time to do it now. We’re falling apart. Maybe not the way John Q describes it, but we -are- falling apart. [As Dan says] Our elites are either complicit or feckless cowards. That’s no way to run a country. Prepare yourselves, prepare your countries. Talk to your elected officials. nonrenormalizable 09.02.25 at 5:16 am Plausible or not, in about 6 months time this post will be the source material which various LLMs will draw upon to inform users that two Teslas had a serious crash resulting in the deaths and hospitalisation of several schoolchildren, and that Tether will have broken the buck. David Eisenberg 09.02.25 at 9:22 am In terms of style, it works really well. It reminds me of one of the “future history” stories I ever read: The Great Nebraska Sea. Laban 09.02.25 at 9:39 am Chetan Murthy 24 Rural France is pretty neat, as long as you don’t expect too much. A very liberal friend lives in a village where le Pen is by far the most popular politician. OTOH, France have perfected lawfare against dangerous parties, as have the UK. Le Pen is banned from standing in 2027, and the SNP found legal problems at the height of their electoral appeal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Branchform Harry 09.02.25 at 12:38 pm Alex — not sure what I said to provoke that comment really. Yes, it coalesced around Trump. But its a minority of R voters; the primary system and his cult of personality coalesced it. Most R elected officials at the national level will revert to supporting business interests as soon as they dare (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). If Vance or someone else can do what Trump has done MAGA will remain very powerful. And maybe they can. I just don’t see who it is. And yes, the Dems seem hopeless, there’s very little opposition. As of now it looks entirely possible that the Trumpists are going to induce the Dems into the error of choosing Gary Numan.. sorry, Gavin Newsom as their candidate. Not saying it isn’t grim, of course it it. But coalitions are coalitions, and this one seems to have required a particular person to bring it together, and that person can’t last long. Remember too that the leading figures in MAGA are a bunch of scumbags who are genuinely driven by personal ambition more than anything, and that’s not a recipe for long term stability. Jacob 09.02.25 at 2:13 pm If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result? Mike Furlan 09.02.25 at 2:37 pm (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). Rather, I think, an even worse fear, that differing with Trump will hurt their careers. And not just R politicians, the country is run by careerists who are easily manipulated or intimidated by Trump. (Put me in Tim “Apple’s” place, for one example, and I’m not sure I would behave any better. I’m not blaming.) Another explanation is Adrian Tchaikowsky‘s in “Bear Head” that some people are like parasitic insects that invade and exploit ant colonies in a way that the ants have no defense. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 3:49 pm Laban @ 27: I am not yet a refugee. But the way I understand it, “once a refugee, always a refugee”. [esp. since I’m 60] I don’t think I’ll be resting easy wherever I land. It’s just a safe[r] place with the rule of law (for now) and if things start to hot up, I’ll move on. As a famous philosopher once said, “it is what it is”.

The ridiculous pricing set by crypto miners and AI investors would stop, and they’d have to return to a profile like AMD’s.

Do you have kids? I was never an advocate until I realized we needed that option (virtual public charter for us but full HS for some). You might be falsely associating homeschooling with conservative christians or christian nationalists and while that certainly is often the case, there is a sizable portion of secular non religious families that choose home school or public virtual charters for their own reasons (academic advancement, special needs, etc.). So maybe rethink that? John Q 09.02.25 at 7:08 pm Jacob @29 “If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result?” If US democracy persists because of events similar to those I’ve described, an economic crash followed by a Republican split-up, I’ll be looking prophetic. If the Dems win the 2026 midterms, Trump serves out his second term without much more damage to democracy, and Vance is defeated in 2028, not so much. But the loss of my self-esteem as an analyst and predictor would be a small price to pay. And, if neither of these happens, and Trumpist rule continues, I can comfort myself that I am old and on the other side of the planet.

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer says the robots aren’t coming for your paycheck — and she’s betting big that artificial intelligence will make more Americans upwardly mobile, not unemployed. In a Fox Business interview airing Labor Day weekend, the Oregon Republican-turned-cabinet-chief dismissed anxiety about mass layoffs as AI spreads from factory floors to office cubicles. “There should be no threat of AI displacing the American worker,” Chavez-DeRemer told Fox Business. “What we’re hearing on the ground is AI is here to stay,” she added. “The President wants the United States to be the leader in AI, to win that AI race.” The rosy portrait comes as corporate executives have warned that AI will likely reduce employment rolls in key white collar fields — with some doomsayers predicting a bloodbath of mass layoffs. Chavez-DeRemer, confirmed in March with bipartisan support, argued AI will take the drudgery out of tasks and help workers reach higher-pay roles supervising and operating the new tech. “I’ve been through companies where AI is assisting the American worker,” she said, describing a plant that replaced manual carbon-fiber coiling with 3-D printing. “Now those workers are reskilled and upskilled, and now they’re running the line.” The secretary’s rosy outlook comes as the administration rolls out an aggressive pro-AI agenda that seeks to assert US dominance in the technology, while keeping Main Street on board.

In April, President Trump signed an executive order making “AI literacy and proficiency” a national priority, directing agencies to seed K-12 classrooms, teacher training and apprenticeships with AI content and to expand pathways for lifelong learners. The White House followed in July with “America’s AI Action Plan,” which casts American workers as the policy’s center of gravity and tees up new measures to track AI’s labor-market impact, expand apprenticeships and stand up an “AI Workforce Research Hub” at the Labor Department. Last week, the Labor Department issued guidance urging states to use federal funding for AI-skills training — from prompting and evaluating AI outputs to basic cybersecurity tied to responsible use. The memo explicitly ties the push to the April executive order and spells out how youth, adult and dislocated-worker programs can weave AI into short-term classes, credentials and work-based learning. Leading tech and business figures have been sounding alarms that AI could wipe out up to half of all white-collar jobs within just a few years, with CEOs from Anthropic, Ford, Amazon and others openly bracing for mass cuts. Experts like Dario Amodei and Kai-Fu Lee warn of a looming “white-collar bloodbath,” with entry-level roles in finance, law, consulting and tech especially vulnerable. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt predicts most coding work will soon be done by AI, while Amazon’s Andy Jassy says corporate head-counts will shrink as efficiency improves. The IMF estimates 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted, urging governments to pour resources into retraining to cushion the blow. Even AI champions like Sam Altman admit that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” warning that the transition will be painful before any new opportunities emerge. One study suggests this could already be happening for entry-level workers, whose skills are the easiest to replicate with AI. Economists found that employment for young software engineers dropped 20% between late 2022 and early 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat’s Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions. “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.” As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014. Responding to Tom Lee’s bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails. JPMorgan, for example, has used Ethereum-based technology for its permissioned blockchain projects for about a decade and is joined by Goldman Sachs, Onyx, and a growing roster of major banks launching stablecoin and DeFi initiatives on Ethereum. Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves. When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum’s supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption. And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries. VanEck’s CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street’s token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs. As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative: “Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.” In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Ethereum’s surging momentum doesn’t come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum’s toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016. The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices. Still, bullish fundamentals remain. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states: “The one quibble that I have with what Tom has been saying, and I keep telling him this: he is not nearly bullish enough.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs face $291 mln in outflows: Is a market shift coming?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-face-291-mln-in-outflows-is-a-market-shift-coming/

Could Ethereum be gearing up to outshine Bitcoin? Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs saw sharp outflows on the 29th of August, with ETH funds losing $164.6 million and BTC funds $126.6 million, amid renewed macroeconomic pressure. Ethereum’s [ETH] impressive streak of ETF inflows in August has come to a halt, closing the month on a note of heavy withdrawals. According to data from Farside Investors, ETH ETFs registered a sharp outflow of $164.6 million on the 29th of August. It effectively ended six consecutive days of strong inflows that had drawn nearly $1.9 billion into the market. Grayscale’s ETHE product led the retreat with $61.3 million in outflows, followed by $51 million from Fidelity’s ETH fund, $28.6 million from Grayscale’s other ETH offering, and $23.7 million from Bitwise. Other issuers, including BlackRock, saw no net flows on the day. The reversal coincided with Ethereum’s price action, trading at $4,442 after a 6.75% weekly decline, though it managed a slight 1% recovery in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. A similar trend played out on the Bitcoin [BTC] side, where ETFs recorded combined outflows of $126.6 million, the first day of losses since 22nd August. The largest outflow came from 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $72.1 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $66.2 million withdrawn, while Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $15.3 million in exits. However, the pain wasn’t universal, as BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $24.63 million and WisdomTree’s BTCW added $2.3 million, though most other issuers reported flat activity. This aligned with Bitcoin slipping 5.32% over the week but was changing hands at $108,783.89 with a modest 0.6% rebound in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The timing of these outflows further aligned with fresh macroeconomic data out of the U.S. In July, the Federal Reserve’s favored measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, increased by 2.9% compared to last year, marking its fastest rise since February. The hotter-than-expected print raised speculation about prolonged tight monetary policy, dampening appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, despite the near-term jitters, optimism around Ethereum’s long-term prospects remains intact. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin echoed the bullish thesis of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, both projecting that ETH’s valuation could climb by as much as 100 times over the coming years. Lubin noted, “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more. Yes, Ethereum/ETH will flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Lookonchain’s on-chain analytics highlighted that a long-term Bitcoin investor recently moved 2,000 BTC, valued at $217 million, into Hyperliquid to swap it for spot Ethereum. This shows a growing conviction among some seasoned players that Ethereum could outperform in the next cycle. In fact, as per AMBCrypto’s recent analysis, many market watchers believe that Q4 could ignite an Ethereum-led rally, with ambitious projections of a possible climb toward $10,000. If this becomes the case, then the recent outflows may be little more than a pause before Ethereum reclaims center stage in the crypto market.

Title: ETH And BTC ETFs Reverse Gains With $291M In Outflows Ahead Of New Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. US-based crypto ETFs have witnessed a change in dynamics in August, which has seen inflows tipping towards Ethereum ETFs. However, last week’s trend of strong inflows ended with substantial outflows on Friday, with Ethereum ETFs leading the retreat with $164.64 million and Bitcoin ETFs following with $126.64 million. This sudden reversal coincides with an interesting timing of stubborn inflation data that seems to have rattled institutional investors. According to data from Farside Investors, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs ended the week with $164.64 million in outflows. The outflows came from Fidelity’s FETH with $51 million, Bitwise’s ETHW with $23.7 million, Grayscale’s ETHE with $28.6 million, and Grayscale’s ETH with $61.3 million. BlackRock, on the other hand, witnessed neither inflows nor outflows into its Spot ETH ETFs, alongside 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton Ethereum ETFs. Friday’s outflows were a jarring departure from the steady gain that had defined Ethereum’s Spot ETFs since August 21. Ethereum’s six-day inflow streak, which had added about $1.876 billion, was brought to an abrupt end with the outflows on Friday. As a result, total assets under management for Spot Ethereum ETFs dipped to $28.58 billion. Ethereum ETF Flow: Farside Investors Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded their first daily decline since August 22 with $126.64 million in outflows on Friday. As a result, their total assets under management dropped to $139.95 billion. However, not every issuer felt the pressure with Bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $66.2 million, followed by ARKB’s $72.07 million and GBTC’s $15.3 million in outflows. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT still managed $24.63 million in inflows and WisdomTree’s BTCW drew in $2.3 million amid the wider outflows. Bitcoin ETF Flow: Farside Investors The underlying cause of the outflows can be attributed to investors digesting the latest data on inflation released on Friday. Notably, the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index climbed 2.9% year-over-year in July, the fastest pace since February, creating fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off on rate cuts. As a new trading week begins, Spot ETF flow in both Ethereum and Bitcoin is likely to depend on how investors continue to interpret the data. If inflation pressures persist, institutional investors may retreat further at the beginning of the week. However, any signs of cooling could see inflows resume mid-week, particularly into Ethereum, where fundamentals are currently favorable. On the price side of things, Bitcoin’s hold above the $108,000 price may offer some relief. However, it needs to stay above $110,000 in order for any upside move to gain momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,910. For Ethereum, a daily close above $4,500 could confirm the return of bullish confidence, whereas a slide below $4,400 might signal further weakness. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,470, up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Google Investors Surprisingly Chill About Major Data Breach

Time Published: 2025-08-31T13:05:36Z
Full Content:
The stock of Google’s parent company ended Fridayâs trading session relatively unchanged, as investors digested news of a major data leak and broader market developments. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)âs shares closed at $213.53, up slightly from the day’s prior end price, despite Google‘s global security alert advising its 2.5 billion Gmail users to update their information following a data breach involving one of its Salesforce databases. The company immediately issued a network-wide alert telling users to change their password immediately. Despite all that, investors in Google had either not fully digested the news during Friday trade, or were watching see what fallout might continue over the weekend, before pricing in any hit to the company’s value. Though consumerÂ GmailÂ and Cloud accounts were not directly compromised, the incident has triggered an aggressive wave of phishing and impersonation attacks targeting users across the platform. The leak, which exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents and personal data, has underscored growing concerns about cybersecurity risks facing major tech firms. Still, despite major data breaches at all the tech giants, seemingly in an endless game of round robin, investors continue to believe the potential of these companies outweighs most security concerns. Alphabet said in a statement it is investigating the breach and implementing additional security measures, but the incident has added to scrutiny of data management practices across the industry. âThe safety and privacy of user data are paramount,â it read. âWe are working diligently to address these issues and prevent future incidents.â Meanwhile, investors are still nervously cautious about signs of economic slowdown and Federal Reserve signals hinting at future interest rate cuts. Despite the turbulence, Alphabetâs stock maintained its position, reflecting investorsâ ongoing confidence in the companyâs core advertising and cloud businesses. But questions about data security continue to cloud its outlook. As the debate over digital privacy and cybersecurity intensifies, Alphabetâs response and its ability to restore trust will be closely watched by shareholders and regulators alike. Google sought this week to reassure consumers and investors. The breach exposed thousands of sensitive records, including personal details, corporate documents, and government information. The leaked data spread across multiple sources and was easily accessible via search engines. It includes confidential information such as legal files, financial records, and private communications. Experts warn that such exposure not only jeopardizes individual privacy but also heightens the risk of corporate espionage, identity theft, and national security threats. In its statement, Google emphasized that it is actively investigating the incident and has deployed additional security measures to identify and mitigate the breachâs impact. Cybersecurity analysts warn that the proliferation of data leaks reflects broader systemic issues in how companies handle sensitive information, as the industry remains largely unregulated and prone to cyberattacks. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for stronger data protection standards and increased transparency around data management practices. As consumers and businesses grapple with the potential fallout, authorities worldwide are calling for stricter oversight of data security protocols to mitigate the risks posed by such breaches in an increasingly interconnected world.

With the film consistently ranking in Netflix’s top 10, breaking the streaming service’s record for most-watched film with over 236 million viewers, and the song “Golden” reaching the coveted #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 , a feat that a female girl group hasn’t achieved since Destiny’s Child released their hit "Independent Woman, Part 1" in 2000, it’s clear that the stars of the animated film, HUNTR/X, pronounced “Huntrix,” are making waves in the industry. Even one of these achievements would solidify an artist's standing, but this girl group has several, and here’s the thing: they aren’t finished yet. With their singing voices provided by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami, the group was created to go beyond the world of animation. With animation by Sony Pictures Imageworks, dynamic choreography combined with powerful vocals makes Rumi, Mira, and Zoey feel like real K-Pop idols, even though the audience knows they are animated. Their performances, style, and voices, combined with Netflix’s overwhelming streaming power explain why this group quickly achieved chart-topping hits, streams, and nominations since the films' release. The MTV Video Music Awards have been a way to measure the staying power and impact of musical acts and stars in moments that have stayed at the forefront of pop culture history. From Lady Gaga’s meat dress to Beyoncé revealing her pregnancy after performing or Janet Jackson’s tribute to her late brother, Michael Jackson, the VMAs are a night for juggernauts in the music industry to showcase their talent and earn awards for their contributions to the industry. While it might seem unusual that a fictional group could be nominated, let alone win at the VMAs, other groups, especially virtual bands, have performed at and even won awards at the show in the past. The Gorillaz, for instance, are a virtual band and the brainchild of Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, and back in 2005, they had Noodle, a cartoon and one of the band members, deliver an acceptance speech in a short animation where she called in from a capsule hotel room on behalf of her group members. That same year, the group performed live using hologram technology at the MTV EMAs, where they played their hit song Feel Good Inc. with De La Soul. What started as a passion project turned into proof that virtual acts can attract audiences on real-life stages. While MTV has already confirmed performances, acts like Lady Gaga, Post Malone, Ricky Martin, who will receive the Latin Icon Award, and Mariah Carey, who will receive the Video Vanguard Award, how well HUNTR/X is received could be an indicator for whether or not there is a space for them to perform in the future, as Netflix has already expressed interest in continuing projects set in the world of KPop Demon Hunters. At the VMAs, if past group performances are any guide, anything can happen. Whether HUNTR/X wins or they put on a virtual show with animation, holograms, or a montage of film clips, the nomination itself is a spectacle and something to be proud of. This could be a defining moment in pop culture history, one where Netflix allows its fictional girl group to crossover into the real world. HUNTR/X has already demonstrated its ability to succeed with streaming and merchandise; now, the MTV VMAs might be the launchpad that this world-dominating animated girl group needs to step into the real world and conquer another frontier while its popularity is still at its peak: touring.

The majority of the early adopters wasted their money chasing the promised la-la world. It took a lot of painful efforts in strategising, governance and change management that finally turned these technologies to deliver the benefits. It looks like Gen-AI projects are in the same situation today. Enterprise boards were quick to embrace it for its transformative power, but the latest findings from MIT’s NANDA initiative reveal a sobering truth: Of the hundreds of deployments surveyed, a mere 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration, while the rest linger in pilot purgatory or total failure. The “GenAI Divide” is real and widening. Why this disheartening pattern? And, more importantly, how can enterprises reverse this? To the experienced eye, the culprits seem obvious: yet-to-mature technology, unclear regulation, or the occasional model hallucination. But the MIT findings suggest the real villain is the flawed integration and huge learning gap. As a general-purpose tool, Gen-AI is great for individual users. For most knowledge workers, platforms like ChatGPT turn productive in content creation, faster search and analysis. But this becomes sort of a liability at scale. They seem to fail to adapt to enterprise workflow and not get attached to proprietary data ecosystems. They miss the finer contextual details to make complex decisions. Therein lies the failure of pilots. * More than half of AI budgets was allocated to sales and marketing tools, and key areas where substantial ROI could be lying were ignored, especially in back-office automation. Imagine how much enterprises would have saved if BPO costs were eliminated or if the reliance on external agencies were eliminated. Even operational excellence could drive better ROI by reducing costs. * Building one’s own solutions succeeds only one-third as often as purchased solutions. Most businesses refuse to believe this and stubbornly pursue in-house development. Partnering with specialised providers makes better sense. * Centralised adoption with innovation teams to drive AI, creates ivory towers. Success correlates strongly with empowering line managers and embedding AI into day-to-day operational decisions. * Employees, starved of sanctioned tools, adopt unsupported solutions like ChatGPT. This leads to compliance and security risks, with governance gaps. Clearly, the evidence is there for enterprises to follow a different playbook and avoid such blunders. (i) Can you anchor AI to one high-stake pain point? Air Canada didn’t deploy Gen-AI for broad marketing tactics but for automating contract review and compliance checks. It found a 60% reduction in legal processing times and delivered measurable cost savings. The few success stories show a common theme: unwavering focus. In contrast, companies that scatter AI budgets across multiple areas without prioritising have seen poor or no impact, leading to scepticism. (ii) Can you first buy or partner and then build? During the COVID-19 vaccine race, Pfizer engaged startups like Concerto HealthAI as partners to use AI in accelerating drug discovery. This buy-and-partner strategy helped in reducing years from research timelines in vaccine discovery using the power of ecosystems. Proprietary AI systems may sound exciting, but when you need a lot of data, going all alone is the loud noise before defeat. Many financial services companies have built proprietary GenAI engines in isolation and ended up halting rollouts and increasing costs, typically associated with the build-it-yourself fallacy. (iii) Can you decentralise rollout to the edges? Unilever has trained SBU heads along with data scientists to identify AI use cases, which resulted in a successful rollout. This way, GenAI was embedded into forecasting and procurement, saving millions in supply chain improvements. AI should not be a cloistered experiment in a central lab. Real transformation occurs when line managers own the integration. A large MNC bank poured resources into its “AI Centre of Excellence” but barred branch managers from influencing pilots, leading to wonderful PoCs that never scaled. (iv) Can you reorganise workflows before AI integration? The shipping liner, Maersk, started with standardising shipping documentation and digitised customs workflows before integrating GenAI for intelligent document processing. This resulted in a 30% reduction in turnaround time at ports. Do not treat AI as a plug-in for processes that are broken. Many e-retailers tend to layer chatbots over chaotic customer service workflows, and this will frustrate both agents and consumers. (v) Can you manage the human angle with foresight? IBM used an attrition-led reskilling model and announced that AI would automate over 7500 roles. It simultaneously invested in upskilling plans for data analytics and AI ethics. By doing both, it contained employee anxieties and kept its brand image of a responsible innovator. In an era when human roles are made redundant, managing panic-driven layoffs is critical and not like the TCS layoffs recently. Mass lay-offs by Meta and Amazon eroded trust and drove talent to competitors, damaging the employer brand. (vi) Can you incorporate governance and metrics? What Microsoft has done with its Copilot for enterprise clients is a case in point. It includes a robust ROI framework, tracking metrics like time-to-task completion and employee satisfaction. This helps in driving AI as a credible performer. Remember the saying, “What cannot be measured cannot be scaled.” Businesses that skirt this issue fake wins, with CFOs questioning the effectiveness of every rupee spent. Tech won’t save you; culture will. The winners? They treat failure like a cheap intern: tolerated, taught, then fired fast. They hype small wins like blockbuster premieres. And Gen-AI? It’s Fool’s Gold – shiny, seductive, yet treacherous. Be reminded: AI won’t replace you, but dumb strategy surely will.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader.

Title: I missed out on my first choice in Trinity. Will CAO points drop in round two?

I missed out on my first-choice course – business, economics and social studies in Trinity – by 23 points in last Wednesday’s round of CAO offers. I have been offered another business degree programme in Dublin, but really want to study Bess in Trinity. What are the chances points will drop in later rounds? The chances of a high-demand course such as Bess at Trinity dropping in points by this margin is remote, based on trends over previous years. This means you have until 3pm on Tuesday, September 2nd, to accept the lower preference offer you received last Wednesday. After that, the offer lapses. If you are appealing grades in this year’s Leaving Cert, remember, there is usually a one-in-four or one-in-five chance of getting an upgrade, based on previous trends. If your mind is really set on securing a place in Bess at Trinity and you don’t accept your lower preference offer today, you have a number of options: 1. Repeat the Leaving Cert, hoping to secure higher scores next year. This route, once popular, has diminished in numbers in recent years. 2. Apply for a place in one of the business or law programmes offered by further education colleges in the next few days. You can access a list of all such level-five PLC (post-Leaving Cert) programmes online (Qualifax.ie). These programmes are usually assessed through a series of eight modules or assignments which students submit monthly from October-May. Further education (FE) or PLC courses as a route into university are probably one of the best-kept secrets of the education system. Many students – and parents – still don’t know enough about them, even though they offer an excellent route to third level, outside the pressure cooker CAO points system. In fact, there are more than 1,000 CAO courses across all areas which admit PLC students. In your case, I am aware of FE students who, having completed their level-five business or law programme, secured an offer of a place in Bess at Trinity. But in every case that I am aware of, the applicant secured distinctions across all eight modules in their course. This is a very useful pathway for students who need a year to prepare themselves for the challenges of university life. In PLC courses, students tend to have the time and space to develop more independent learning skills, learn to work in teams and deliver projects on time and to a high standard. So, if your heart really is set on Bess, why not seek a place on a locally based business PLC programme immediately. Blackrock Further Education College, for example, offers separate level-five programmes in both business and law. In the unlikely event you receive enough upgrades in the Leaving Cert, or the points requirements drop significantly in the coming weeks, you will receive a late offer from the CAO, which you could then accept.

Title: Breda O’Brien: Interest in Jim Gavin says little for Micheál Martin’s faith in his party colleagues

Since 2011 Micheál Martin has shaped Fianna Fáil more than any other individual. While most acknowledge his relentless work ethic while rebuilding a party in danger of collapse, not every supporter is happy with where he has steered Fianna Fáil. He has done much to improve Fianna Fáil’s perceived image of being cute hoors who were fond of the odd brown envelope. However, he has also alienated many grassroots supporters. They were particularly baffled by his disastrously out-of-touch support for the 2024 Family and Care referendums. His approach to the presidential election has also exposed his distance from his parliamentary party. He seemed disinclined to have Fianna Fáil contest the election at all. However, the symbolic nature of the office remains important, even if securing it has recently resembled the Hunger Games more than an electoral process. A presidential election allows individuals and parties to interrogate their values and present them to the public. Perhaps Fianna Fáil no longer really knows what it stands for. It is not as if there was any scarcity of shy but willing candidates, including Martin’s former close ally, Billy Kelleher. Bertie Ahern, Mary Hanafin and Éamon Ó Cuív, although very different characters, seemed to inspire the same terror as the Ghost of Christmas Past, causing Martin to cry out like Ebenezer Scrooge, “Leave me! ... Haunt me no longer!” Martin’s reasons for opposing Ahern’s run have been well-rehearsed. He has no desire to remind the electorate of being central to Ahern’s team as the economy went into catastrophic meltdown. Hanafin probably lost her chance of a nomination in 2014. She defied instructions to withdraw her candidacy in the local elections in the so-called Battle of Blackrock. Despite winning with relative ease, Hanafin stood in the way of Martin’s preferred type of candidate, a young woman with impeccable liberal credentials, Kate Feeney. (She also got elected.) Éamon Ó Cuív is a distinct case. He epitomises the stark change in the values of Fianna Fáil since 2011. Although reared in Dublin, his focus has been on community capacity-building, particularly in rural areas, ever since he became the manager of a Gaeltacht development co-operative in Corr na Móna. He has always fought for a State responsive to its people, rather than an impenetrable bureaucracy. He has remained a constitutional nationalist and passionate advocate for the Irish language. He is the antithesis of a finger up to the wind politician and has clashed with Martin on everything from going into Coalition to the Fiscal Compact treaty. For some, he is the great lost leader who could have upheld the better instincts of Fianna Fáil, the localist – as opposed to clientelist – tradition that simply aimed to ensure everyone had a chance of a decent life. [ Former Dublin GAA manager Jim Gavin as Fianna Fáil’s presidential candidate? The pros and consOpens in new window ] Ó Cuív stubbornly plods on with unpopular causes, like visiting republican prisoners in Maghaberry, because he cares about moving them towards useful lives, not how it plays as PR. At the moment Heather Humphreys appears to be the front-runner. Despite Martin’s relentless focus on bringing women into politics, why does he judge Fianna Fáil incapable of fielding a seasoned female politician who would appeal in the same way to middle Ireland? Although strong, capable, articulate and intelligent women, neither Deirdre Heenan nor Siofra O’Leary has political experience or name recognition. (I should disclose that I remember O’Leary fondly as a competent and well-liked head girl in the school where I taught.) Fianna Fáil’s last female presidential candidate was closer to the party’s original values. We have to scrape away the intervening years and remember Mary McAleese before she took to accusing mild-mannered Pope Leo of courting Maga money and Pope Francis of being a “careless pope” and “sometimes narky showman.” She was allegedly too much the green nationalist, too divisive to be a good president. Instead, she and her husband, Martin, did much to advance peace in Ireland. Yes, 1997 was a different time, but Fianna Fáil knew the kind of person they wanted, a woman who had contested an election and had a clear vision of the Ireland she wanted to represent. There is a tendency to dismiss the approach of every president before Mary Robinson as having nothing to offer contemporary Ireland. The underrated Patrick Hillery, who incidentally laid most of the groundwork for free education before Donogh O’Malley took his solo run, proved his mettle when it was most needed. When Charles Haughey attempted to pressure his former colleague not to dissolve the Dáil to enable Fianna Fáil to form a government without a new election, Hillery sent him packing and protected an Army officer whom Haughey had tried to intimidate. The “mature recollection” of this incident later derailed Brian Lenihan’s attempt at the presidency. There is something to be said for a president who does not self-identify as an activist. Yet the proposed – at the time of writing – selection of Jim Gavin, while a decent man of solid Clare Fianna Fáil stock, highlights Martin’s obsession with success in Dublin. It also signals that a once-dominant party lacks an electable politician or former politician embodying its core beliefs. What does that say about the party Martin has shaped and his confidence in his colleagues? © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

Time Published: 2025-08-31T02:15:28Z
Full Content:
31 August 2025 Time taken to read : 11 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The recent developments in Nepal reflect a mix of economic, infrastructural, and regulatory shifts, impacting various sectors. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has rebounded with a 23-point gain, signaling improved market sentiment after a period of significant losses. Meanwhile, discussions around opening the electricity trading market to private players are gaining momentum, with the aim of enhancing competition and market expansion. However, monsoon disruptions have heavily affected the country’s transportation infrastructure, blocking nine major highways and complicating travel. On the regulatory front, the Nepal Rastra Bank has tightened guidelines for banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to ensure more transparent and targeted use of funds. The government is also making strides to exit the FATF grey list by presenting progress on anti-money laundering measures. At the same time, sugarcane farmers have threatened a national highway blockade over unmet demands, highlighting ongoing socio-economic issues. Additionally, Nepal’s increasing reliance on remittances, record gold prices, and developments in agricultural exports to China underscore the country’s economic dynamics. Lastly, while the life insurance sector shows strong growth, the government faces challenges in ensuring consumer protection and addressing infrastructural funding shortfalls in provinces like Karnali. NEPSE rebounds: Index gains 23 points as market sentiment improves The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) gained 23.03 points last week, ending a recent downturn that saw a loss of over Rs 378 billion. The index opened at 2,757.97 on Sunday and closed at 2,781 on Thursday, reaching a high of 2,824.85 and a low of 2,730.74. Ten out of the 13 market sectors saw gains, with the ‘Others’ sector rising by 4.57%. Bikash Hydropower saw a surge of 60.98%, while Narayani Development Bank dropped by 44.46%. Total turnover increased by 8.38% to Rs 32.26 billion, and market capitalization grew to Rs 4.647 trillion, leading to Rs 39 billion in investor gains. Nepal explores private sector entry into electricity trading to boost competition Following a report from the government task force, discussions have begun regarding the opening of Nepal’s electricity trading market to private sector participation. Currently dominated by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the proposal suggests that private companies could enhance competition and expand the market. If implemented, provisions under the Electricity Act 2049 would allow private producers to sell power domestically and internationally, potentially through platforms like NepEx or direct market channels. Experts believe that private sector involvement could fast-track development and improve consumer access to affordable, high-quality electricity. Heavy rain disrupts nine major highways across Nepal Heavy rainfall has led to landslides and flooding, blocking nine key highways in Nepal, the Nepal Police reported. The affected roads include the Koshi Highway at Bhotkhola (Sankhuwasabha), the Nepal-China bridge in Rasuwa, Pasang Lhamu Highway (Rasuwa), and Arniko Highway (Sindhupalchowk). Other impacted routes are the Kaligandaki Corridor (Baglung), Beni-Darbang road (Myagdi), Jajarkot road (Rukum Paschim), Bheri Corridor (Dolpa), and Gokuleshwor-Darchula road (Darchula). Some roads, such as parts of the Mid-Hill, Prithivi, and Kaligandaki corridors, remain open for one-way traffic. Authorities continue to monitor the ongoing situation as monsoon-related disruptions affect travel across the nation. NRB tightens rules on bank CSR funds: Transparent, targeted spending now mandatory Nepal Rastra Bank has introduced new regulations to ensure that corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds are used transparently and effectively by banks and financial institutions. Banks must allocate a fixed percentage of their net profit to CSR, with at least 60% spent within the fiscal year. Institutions are required to prepare annual action plans and submit semi-annual reports detailing their CSR activities. The funds can be used to support education, health, environmental protection, financial literacy, and skill development for targeted communities. Nepal advances plan to exit FATF grey list, showcases progress in Tokyo Nepal has officially begun steps to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after being included in February due to insufficient progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. At the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) plenary session in Tokyo, Nepal presented updates on its quarterly action plan. The Nepali delegation, led by PM Office Secretary Phanindra Gautam and Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Neelam Dhungana Timilsina, highlighted legal reforms, improved monitoring of high-risk sectors, and new coordination mechanisms. The government remains committed to implementing reforms to secure removal from the grey list. Sugarcane farmers threaten indefinite highway blockade from September 10 Sugarcane farmers from across Nepal, who have been protesting in the capital since August 24 over subsidies and government support, have warned of an indefinite blockade along the national highway in Hariwan, Sarlahi, beginning September 10 if their demands remain unmet. Protest coordinator Shyam Babu Ray emphasized that farmers had endured harsh conditions during the sit-in, yet their calls for help had been ignored. The protest, organized by the Sugarcane Producers Federation of Nepal, opposes subsidy cuts and seeks representation in price determination. Nepalis abroad send Rs 4.72 billion daily, driving record remittance inflows Nepali migrant workers sent a record Rs 1.72 trillion home in the last fiscal year, averaging Rs 4.72 billion daily, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. This represents a 19% year-on-year increase and nearly matches the government’s annual budget. The rise in remittances is attributed to increased outmigration, stronger foreign currencies like the US dollar, and a shift from informal to formal transfer channels. While remittances help uplift households, Nepal remains heavily dependent on foreign earnings due to a sluggish domestic economy and low investment levels. Nepal social media listing standoff: Companies resist due to content control rules Nepal’s Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has criticized social media giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft for refusing to register under the country’s 2080 BS social media directive. Although these companies are registered for tax purposes, they resist the government’s listing due to concerns over strict content control rules. The directive mandates the removal of content within 24 hours of complaints, which has raised fears of excessive government intervention. The Asia Internet Coalition has highlighted the challenges in enforcing fair content review, and the government has issued a seven-day ultimatum for compliance. Life insurers collect Rs 3.27B in first premiums, Shrawan 2082/83 Nepal’s life insurance sector showed strong performance in Shrawan 2082/83, with companies collectively collecting over Rs 3.27 billion in first premiums. Nepal Life Insurance led the way with Rs 103 crore, followed by National Life (Rs 42.37 crore) and Citizen Life (Rs 25.01 crore). Other top performers included Himalayan Life, SuryaJyoti Life, LIC Nepal, and IME Life, reflecting strong investor interest and sector growth. Gold smashes Rs 200,000 mark in Nepal as prices soar Gold prices soared last week, crossing the Rs 200,000 per tola threshold for the first time, driven by global market trends. Prices rose by Rs 3,100, fluctuating between Rs 197,200 and Rs 200,600 per tola. The surge was driven by US interest rate cuts, a weaker Indian rupee, and increased gold purchases by China, India, and Turkey. Analysts see gold as a safe haven asset amidst market volatility. Silver prices also rose slightly, reaching Rs 2,360 per tola. Nepal seeks Chinese flexibility to boost agricultural exports Nepal has urged China to adopt flexible customs policies to ease exports of buffalo meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and herbs. During a bilateral meeting in Kathmandu, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari and Chinese Customs Deputy Minister Wang Lingjun discussed the proposal. Nepal is seeking to export thermally processed buffalo meat, ghee, butter, silage, and animal feed, and has asked for concessions on citrus fruit standards. China has acknowledged Nepal’s priority status and agreed to establish a joint trade facilitation mechanism. Currently, 34 Nepali companies export agricultural products to China. IBN approves license draft for 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower project Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has approved the draft license for the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project at its 66th meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board also endorsed a draft for direct investment in the Arun-3 Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha and authorized the issuance of a survey license for the proposed ‘Auto Service Eco-Industrial Park’ project. The decision is seen as a step toward boosting Nepal’s energy sector. Karnali’s bridge projects face funding shortfall, pushed to multi-year plan The Karnali provincial government has allocated Rs 105 million for seven motorable bridges in Rukum West, but the funds are insufficient. Officials have proposed including the projects in a multi-year plan to secure additional funding. The Infrastructure Development Office in Chaurjahari submitted the proposal to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development, warning that the bridges might remain incomplete without timely approval. The lack of bridges in key areas is disrupting local travel, schooling, and livelihoods, especially during the monsoon. KMC fines distillery after fly found in sealed Mustang Gold bottle Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has fined Dhanusha Distillery Pvt. Ltd. Rs 200,000 after a fly was found in a sealed bottle of its Mustang Gold alcoholic beverage. The fine follows a consumer complaint and an inspection by KMC’s Agriculture and Livestock Department. The department confirmed the presence of the inedible object after lab tests. KMC also inspected several other establishments, destroying inedible oil found in four restaurants and one sweet shop.

Title: From GPUs to tokens – How Nvidia’s optimism might influence the Crypto AI sector

Time Published: 2025-08-30T21:00:16Z

The Crypto AI sector has not kept pace with the wider altcoin market’s price gains. Nvidia’s fiscal report has projected sustained revenue growth for the next quarter, while tech companies like MongoDB and Pure Storage closed out a bullish week. Can this affect the Crypto AI sector’s sentiment? Nvidia [NVDA] is in the news today after it reported its Q2 fiscal results for the second quarter ended the 27th of July, 2025. Its revenue of $46.7 billion was up 6% from the previous quarter and 56% higher than a year ago. Its outlook for the third quarter remains bullish, with revenue expected to be as high as $54 billion. Referring to the Nvidia GPU architecture, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.” He added that the “NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary” and that the AI race os on. The bullish commentary and the company’s aggressive share repurchase plans could be a sign of greater confidence. That’s not all though as demand hasn’t been slowing down. In fact, the strong growth in the company’s revenue seemed to be in contrast with signs of fatigue in AI-related stocks. Following the fiscal report release earlier in the week, NVDA’s stock saw a 5.95% correction. It fell from Thursday’s high at $184.13 to Friday’s low of $173.17. The generative AI boom in 2022, after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, meant that GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and cloud vendors like Microsoft and Google were big winners. There have been some recent winners too, with Enterprise technology company MongoDB noting a 45.7% rally last week. CEO Dev Ittycheria, speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, said, “You start to see deployments of agents to automate back office, maybe automate sales and marketing, but it’s still not yet kind of full force in the enterprise.” This statement captures the cautious optimism across the market. As far as Crypto AI tokens are concerned, it could take some time for decentralized AI solutions to gain traction. However, when traditional AI players such as NVDA see a hike in bullish sentiment, there will be some impact on the crypto AI sector. Source: TAO/USDT on TradingView At the time of writing, Bittensor [TAO], the biggest crypto AI token by market capitalization, was down 56% from its December high of $748. Bitcoin’s [BTC] performance since April has not been enough to lead TAO token to recovery either. Source: RENDER/USDT on TradingView Similarly, Render [RENDER] has depreciated by 70% from its December high of $11.9. Together, these two tokens highlighted how the AI token market sentiment may be risk-averse. Even though the altcoin market cap, including Ethereum [ETH], has expanded by nearly 60% since April’s lows, the AI sector has only managed 30%. AI tokens come with high risks, but also high rewards for buyers. Their performance would be dependent on the crypto market sentiment, as well as the wider market’s outlook on AI.

Title: Munster dominate Leinster to win Interpro championship

Munster lifted the Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship trophy for the first time since January 2023, delivering a dominant performance to beat Leinster 50-15 at Energia Park. It was a disappointingly one-sided final, but that should not take away from Munster’s sizzling seven-try display as they cruised past the three-in-a-row hopefuls Leinster, even without injured top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru and vice-captain Stephanie Nunan. A barnstorming first-half performance from Matt Brown’s side had them leading 31-0 at the break, with Chloe Pearse, in her final appearance in red, Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (2), and Aoife Corey sharing out the tries. Centre Caitríona Finn, the player-of-the-match for the third time in the Championship, tallied up 20 points in all, really stamping her mark on the game after only making her first senior start for Munster three weeks ago. Tries from Munster captain Maeve Óg O’Leary, Finn, and Eilís Cahill made it 50 unanswered points, before Leinster, whose new head coach Ben Martin handed out 20 debuts across the four-match series, gained some late consolation. Harder hit by their Rugby World Cup representation, and perhaps also by last week’s tough encounter with Connacht, the defending champions rallied with tries from replacement Katie Whelan (63 and 73 minutes), and Vicky Elmes Kinlan (80). Munster, who had already won 33-22 in Donnybrook in round 2, lost both O’Leary and Gráinne Burke to the sin bin during the final quarter, but their efforts over the opening hour had made certain of a clean sweep of victories, and their 16th Interprovincial crown overall. The title winners’ tight nucleus of senior players, led by inspirational backrower O’Leary, who had a fantastic return to the Interprovincial stage after two knee surgeries, combined very effectively with their emerging young talent this summer.

Title: Historic Flip: Bitcoin ETFs On Pace To Surpass Gold ETFs In AUM
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-to-surpass-gold-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-08-30T20:00:16Z

In the dynamic financial sector, Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly gaining ground against their gold counterparts, with inflows pushing total assets under management toward record highs. Bitcoin ETFs are set to overtake gold ETFs in total assets under management. Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are on the brink of making history globally. In an X post, the Kobeissi Letter, an industry-leading commentary on global capital markets, has revealed that BTC ETFs are on track to surpass Gold ETFs in assets under management (AUM) for the first time in history, marking a historic milestone in global markets. Over the past 12 months, AUM in the largest cryptocurrency ETFs has doubled to $150 billion, while gold ETFs have climbed 40% to a record of $180 billion. The comparison highlights how rapidly momentum has shifted. Just three years ago, gold ETFs were five times larger than Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, with accelerating inflows into digital asset products, that gap is narrowing at a historic speed. If current trends continue, Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs as early as next year. This is a symbolic flip that underscores the rise of crypto from speculative asset to mainstream portfolio allocation. Lately, ETFs are proving to be the engine behind the current crypto bull market. According to Ucan_Coin, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversees nearly 2,000 funds, with about 1,400 of them being ETFs. Clients buy into these funds, while BlackRock earns fees on the assets under management. However, the Bitcoin Spot ETF fee is just 0.25%, but the power lies in scale and liquidity. Over the last two years, ETFs have provided the critical fuel for this rally, with nearly 20% of all liquidity entering crypto now flowing directly from ETF products. As Ucan_Coin highlights, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out. As the chart demonstrates, IBIT is the locomotive pulling the entire market, driving inflows and setting the pace for the broader bull run. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining remarkable momentum, while generating $5 to $10 billion in daily volume on their most active trading days. Pushpendra Singh, Co-founder of PushpendraTech and SmartViewAi, has explained that this surge is a clear sign that institutional investors are increasingly seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin, and ETFs are rapidly becoming their preferred gateway. Despite the ETF boom, Binance continues to dominate the spot market, processing between $10 to $18 billion in daily spot volume and holding a 29% market share. This is more than double the 13% market share currently held by US-based ETFs, and it puts Binance comfortably ahead of other major exchanges in terms of liquidity.

Title: Reframing Jensen’s Law: ‘Buy more, make more’ and AI factory economics
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/30/reframing-jensens-law-buy-make-ai-factory-economics/
Time Published: 2025-08-30T19:59:12Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 15:59 EDT / AUGUST 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of artificial intelligence factories. Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s own language and Nvidia’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, performance per watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Huang’s invoking of Buy more to make more (that is, revenue up) and buy more to save more (unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis, we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators — and where the law is not applicable. Note on scope and conditions. Our interpretation of Jensen’s law applies primarily to power-limited AI factories operating at high utilization on communication-heavy training and long-context inference workloads, with elastic demand and operator-retained margins. Outside these conditions (for example, capex-limited or demand-limited sites or batchable inference, or where vendor rents are constrained by poor operating leverage), the relationship weakens or can even invert. In this research note, we refer to our interpretation of Jensen’s Law, Jensen’s law, the new Jensen’s law or true Jensen’s law and use them interchangeably. As we move beyond single-shot prompts, reasoning and agentic AI multiplies compute per task (100X-1,000X according to Nvidia and other sources). We hear all the time that data centers are increasingly power‑constrained. Nvidia’s GB300/NVLink 72/Spectrum‑X stack explicitly targets tokens per watt as the metric to optimize along with improving achieved utilization. The assumption is, together, these variables directly allow AI customers to monetize power‑limited factories. Remember, our interpretation of Jensen’s law assumes a new dollar of spend is worth it only if the lifetime extra revenue from better efficiency and utilization is bigger than the lifetime extra costs, after accounting for risk. With that as context, let’s look at some of the supporting statements from Nvidia’s Q2 FY2026 call on Aug. 27. The core of Jensen’s Law is that performance per watt drives revenue. In a power-limited data center, the number of tokens you can produce in a year is directly tied to how efficient you are. Or as Huang (pictured above) put it: “Performance per watt drives directly to revenues… the more you buy, the more you grow.” On the latest earnings call, Nvidia cited massive efficiency gains — 10 to 50 times more energy efficiency with GB300 versus Hopper, depending on configuration and the use of FP4 precision and NVLink 72. Nvidia gave no indications of workloads, configurations or levels of accuracy, which we’ll continue to research. Nonetheless, we heard concrete return-on-investment proof points. Nvidia cited an example where $3 million spend on GB200 infrastructure generated $30 million in token revenue. That’s a 10X return, presumably not a model, but actual operating data from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI (not cited specifically). And networking is playing a much bigger role. Nvidia’s stack itself spans all three dimensions: NVLink for scale-up inside the rack, Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand for scale-out across clusters, and Spectrum-XGS for scale-across multisite AI factories. By lifting network utilization from about 65% toward 85% to 90%, the company argues that “networking is effectively free” because the throughput gain more than covers the fabric cost. Our interpretation here is networking can be economically free in communication-heavy environments where utilization gains are greater than fabric cost. Put in context with spending, Nvidia claims the “Big 4” hyperscalers (big three of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, plus Meta Platforms Inc.) are on pace to spend about $600 billion this year on data centers, a figure we peg lower, at just north of $400 billion – nonetheless, still huge. Perhaps Nvidia is sizing the entire data center buildout spend, which still exceeds our estimates. Nvidia sizes the remaining decade’s AI infrastructure build at $3 trillion to $4 trillion, which also are significantly higher than our market projections — but still huge and this is the capex flywheel Jensen is pointing to. Perhaps Jensen has better visibility on demand than we do. The common usage in the press (for example, IEEE Spectrum, the WSJ, Tom’s Hardware and others) positions “Jensen’s Law” as Nvidia’s acceleration beyond Moore’s Law — shorter cycles and outsized generation‑over‑generation gains. That’s directionally spot on, but we want to put a finer point on the law. In our view, the missing lever is one of economics. Our premise today is there’s a version of Jensen’s Law that is more than just marketing and it relates to the economics of AI Factories. Let’s review the core principle that’s emerging in the economics of AI factories. In a power-limited environment, every incremental dollar of spend that improves performance per watt and fabric efficiency drives monetizable throughput — tokens per second — faster than it raises total cost. That dynamic leads to two outcomes: Further, when utilization gains at the fabric level are significant, high-speed networking becomes economically free. The throughput lift outweighs the amortized cost of the networking gear. This of course is dependent on the existing utilization assumptions, the workload and the potential gains in utilization. This framing ties directly back to some of the classic laws of technology economics as shown on the right-hand side of the graphic above. What’s new is that these principles are being operationalized specifically for power-limited AI factories, and we’re anchoring them with explicit revenue math, which we’ll share shortly. That’s the shift — moving from abstract laws of progress to concrete, financial drivers of the AI economy. It might be helpful to review these classical laws, and we’ll tie them into our new interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The following is a brief summary of the laws shown above and the role they play in the new Jensen’s Law as we’ve described: Moore’s Law: speaks to device scaling and feeds the performance/watt gains – that is, the more tokens you can produce per year at a fixed power envelope the better the economics. Wright’s Law: cost declines by a constant as cumulative volume doubles – this explains the cost/token falling a deployments scale – core to the “save more” side of the equation. Metcalfe’s Law: value grows exponentially as a function of connectivity. This speaks to the network utilization – scale up, scale out, scale across, making networking economically “free.” Jevons’ Paradox: efficiency increases consumption and supports the flywheel effects of Jensen’s Law as we’ve defined it. Let’s break down the math behind our interpretation of this new Jensen’s Law. We can boil it down to three things: how many tokens you can generate, how much revenue those tokens produce, and what each token costs to make. Start with throughput — tokens per year. That’s a function of four variables: the power budget, the amount of operating time in a year, the efficiency of the system — meaning tokens per unit of energy — and how well you can utilize the cluster. Put those together, and the formula is as follows: [Tokens per year = power X efficiency X utilization.] Once you know throughput, revenue is just a matter of multiplying tokens by dollars per token. That gives you the top line. [Revenue = tokens X dollars per token.] Now let’s look at the cost side of the equation. Cost per token is your total annualized expense — servers, racks, networking, cooling, electricity, staff, real estate — divided by tokens per year. In other words, take capex plus energy plus other operating expenses and spread it across your token output. [Cost per token = capex (annualized) + energy costs + other opex​/annual token output.] Finally, gross margin. That’s one minus cost per token over price per token. Put simply, the more efficient you are at generating tokens and keeping the system utilized, the more your margin expands. [1-cost per token/price per token.] So when we say performance per watt times utilization equals revenue, this is the math. It’s not just a marketing slogan when the conditions are right, rather it’s a financial model for AI factories. Here’s a simplified graphic that lays this out more clearly: Jensen’s economic argument for networking goes something like this: If you buy more on a faster fabric, better cooling, or smarter software and it improves efficiency or utilization enough, then the extra revenue from more tokens will outweigh the extra cost of that upgrade. If efficiency and utilization gains are greater than the added costs…buy more, make more applies, because cost per token also falls… leading to buy more, save more. When efficiency cuts unit cost, you can charge less per token. If demand is elastic (customers want more when it’s cheaper), revenue grows even faster — reinforcing the Jensen flywheel as we discussed earlier. Let’s put this in a picture and look at the value flow of Jensen’s Law – “Follow the Money.” To do so,we’ll put our version of Jensen’s Law in plain language. Think of an AI factory like a cafeteria. The cafeteria has ovens (GPUs), cooks (software) and a delivery system (networking). The point is to serve as many meals (tokens) as possible every day, while keeping costs low and making money. Here’s the flow shown in the chart above: So the new Jensen’s Law is: Buy more to upgrade the cafeteria, and you’ll either serve more meals (make more) or serve each meal cheaper (save more). If both happen, your profit gets a double whammy. Networking fits right in. Better networking is like upgrading the cafeteria’s conveyor belts so every oven stays busy. Even if conveyor belts cost extra, they pay for themselves because the cafeteria serves way more meals. That’s why Nvidia says the “network is free.” The loop on the right is the accretive-spend rule. It means: So the test is: Does the revenue uplift from higher efficiency/utilization outweigh the added cost of the upgrade? The key is you have to take a systems view, which is something that Jensen always stresses – “we’re don’t just build chips, we build systems.” This is a key part of Nvidia’s moat, which is underappreciated in our view. If one part of the system is optimized (for example, more ovens create more meals) but the conveyor belt is not fast enough then the system is out of balance and revenue is not maximized. Nvidia’s Q2 results included some proof points for our interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The company gave several examples showing how new architectures and fabrics translate directly into revenue multiples and lower costs per token. Below is our take on some of those. First, reasoning and agentic AI: Unlike simple chatbots, these agents plan, use tools and iterate. That makes workloads 100 to 1,000 times more compute-intensive, which means efficiency and utilization gains matter a lot more. A key question to ask here is how is Nvidia accounting for utilization? For example, how does the calculation account for multi-tenant overheads, queueing efficiency, I/O fragmentation and restarts? Second, GB300 with NVLink 72: At rack scale, it delivers about 10X the tokens per watt compared to Hopper. With four-bit floating point math, energy efficiency improves up to 50X per token. CoreWeave Inc. says it’s already seeing 10X better inference on reasoning models in production. We’d be interested in details around what tokenization standards are most productive? What Quality of Service limits (if any) were in place to achieve these 10X to 50X claims? Third, the fabric story: Networking isn’t a side note, it’s fundamental to the economics. Spectrum-X Ethernet is already running at a $10 billion rate, and NVLink 72 gives you 14X the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. That’s why Jensen says the network is effectively free — because if utilization gains outweigh the cost – it is economically free. We’d like to understand this further in terms of what reasonable incremental revenue over the fabric costs would constitute “free.” In other words, what kind of save NPV:Fabric TCO ratio should operators assume to achieve that economic freedom? Is it 1X? 2X? 3X – what is a reasonable cushion to guarantee results? Fourth, the $3 million to $30 million example. Jensen cited a real case where a $3 million spend on infrastructure produced $30 million in token revenue. That’s the “buy more, make more” flywheel in action. Key questions we have include: What was the time window in which this benefit was achieved – i.e. is this a snapshot benefit or one that is sustainable over a period of time? What were the price/token assumptions? What’s a reasonable range of benefit (we assume 10X is a best case scenario for marketing purposes)? And finally, cadence. Nvidia is shipping new architectures every year — Blackwell to Rubin and beyond. Each one drives higher performance per watt, higher utilization and higher revenue. It’s compounding economics. A key issue we see here is if a new Nvidia generation hits before I realize my payback (for example, I hit delays which is a clear risk) and the value of my infrastructure tanks I’m left with a failed business case and will get fired. We see this as especially pressing as AI moves from hyperscale/cloud to enterprise and edge. Bottom line: Nvidia isn’t just selling chips; it’s proving the economic engine of our version of Jensen’s Law. Heavier workloads drive the value of efficiency improvements higher, fabrics keep the graphics processing units busy, and each architecture turn compounds the “buy more, make more” cycle. But operators and enterprise customers must cut through the marketing hype, understand their unique environment and how Nvidia’s impressive claims translate into value for them. We were somewhat surprised by investor reaction to Nvidia’s latest earnings print. Other than a hit to free cash flow margin, we thought the quarter was quite remarkable. And Nvidia addressed the free cash flow in comments about its days sales outstanding, which to us was of no concern. From an investor perspective, Jensen’s Law changes four things in our view as bulleted above and described in more detail below. First, the unit of competition is no longer the chip, it’s the AI factory. What matters is system-level performance per watt and utilization, which rewards rack-scale designs, integrated fabrics, software and cadence. Second, networking isn’t overhead, it can be a profit lever. Utilization gains are so significant that fabric routinely pays for itself — often multiple times over. The caveat is the conditions have to be right. They are today for the large hyperscalers. Will this translate to mainstream enterprises to the same degree? Third, pricing power is being redefined by elasticity. If elasticity exists, as cost per token collapses, providers can still grow revenue by lowering prices, because demand expands even faster. Note: Operators must take the risk that elasticity is greater than 1 (that is, as price drops customers will buy enough to grow revenue). We’re seeing some positive signs in the scramble for capacity and the shift to reasoning workloads – indicating an insatiable appetite for AI services. The caveat here is price per token is ever-changing and very quickly. Often it’s a race to zero between API pricing, free tiers, price cuts, advertising subsidies and the like. The operator’s margin will be affected by these dynamics, which can alter the outcome. And fourth, cadence is a cash machine. Nvidia’s product cadence isn’t just about faster chips, it’s about turning capital spending into a recurring monetization flywheel. Each year, new architectures deliver higher efficiency (more tokens per watt) and better utilization (keeping clusters busier). That combination means every dollar of capex spent on GPUs, networking, and racks generates more revenue in the following cycle. But a key consideration for investors is the degree to which customers can move at the speed of Nvidia. Clearly the hyperscalers and Meta, X.ai, the neoclouds and some service providers can keep up. But mainstream enterprises will struggle to maintain pace. If and when the capex gusher dries up, enterprises and new uses cases like robotics will be the growth engine. The dynamics in these markets will be different. Nonetheless, in today’s hyperscale-led market this is what Jensen means when he says: “the more you buy, the more you grow.” Customers that continually reinvest ride the curve of annual improvements, effectively compounding returns with each generation. We believe this flywheel is in place until the end of this decade at least. Here’s how we think operators should measure Jensen’s Law in the field. First, tokens per joule — true efficiency is rising fast, 10 to 50 times in some cases. Second, utilization — some operators claim clusters run 15% to 25% more efficiently with NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X. Third, power allocation — when the megawatt cap can be flat, every gain in performance per watt drops straight to revenue. Fourth, token price and demand — as price falls, demand rises, and so does revenue (Jevons’ Paradox) Fifth, payback time — some builds now recover in under a year. And finally, fabric mix — NVLink 72 domains are scaling, and XGS (data center to data center) is just starting to emerge. We believe the AI factory math is compelling, but only under strict operating conditions. Jensen’s new Law isn’t guaranteed. There are risks and conditions where it may not hold. First, if a data center isn’t power-limited, then performance per watt isn’t as tightly tied to revenue. Second, if token prices fall faster than efficiency and utilization rise, growth stalls — especially if demand isn’t elastic. Third, workloads matter. If the model isn’t sensitive to fabric speed or collective operations, the return on fabric spend moderates. Fourth, practical constraints like supply chain delays, power or cooling bottlenecks can push out the payoff. Fifth, If alternative stacks or application-specific integrated circuits start to match Nvidia’ end-to-end efficiency, then the economics begin to normalize. The following specific details should be monitored over time in our view: Efficiency claims of 10X to 50X must be validated end-to-end, taking into consideration tokens per joule at accuracy and latency parity. This should be measured at the system level, not on a single GPU. Further, business cases should assume headroom with returns of 3X to 5X over cost to account for the risks. Utilization uplift is equally nuanced. Gains of 15 to 25 points from NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X are real for collective-heavy training and long-context inference, but may be negligible on parallel inference. Operators should expect meaningful sustained improvement over many weeks under production load before scaling. Remember, performance per watt only translates to revenue if power is the binding constraint. If capacity is capped by capex or demand, the linkage weakens. In our opinion, upgrades should proceed only when power will be a constraint for 12 to 24 months. Have high confidence that incremental throughput will be consumed – or ideally is presold. Elasticity assumptions must be grounded. Revenue uplift from price cuts applies only where elasticity is greater than 1. Otherwise, protect margins with tiered QoS. Similarly, sub-year paybacks depend on high utilization, stable token pricing and on-time installations. Our research indicates many investments face unforeseen delays. Assume higher internal rate of return/hurdle rates and longer payback periods in business cases. Operators must retain margin uplifts. In our view, upgrades are accretive only when power is constrained, utilization lifts are proven, demand is elastic, and the surplus accrues to the operator —not only to the infrastructure supplier. Finally, this interpretation of Jensen’s Law works well for hyperscalers and consumer Internet companies. It’s unclear how well it translates to enterprise AI and edge customers. We’ll dig into that as those markets evolve. These are the stress points we need to watch. Hopefully our reframe of Jensen’s Law is clear. The shorthand of “Moore’s Law on steroids” is catchy but incomplete. The economics show that in power-limited AI factories, efficiency (tokens per joule) and utilization (keeping clusters busy) are the true revenue levers. When those improve faster than costs rise, two dynamics follow: Buy more to make more, and buy more to save more. Earnings calls continue to supply supporting evidence: Nvidia cites 10X to 50X efficiency gains, examples of $3 million in infrastructure yielding $30 million in token revenue, and fabric-driven utilization lifts that can make networking effectively free. But we caution that these outcomes only hold under strict conditions —measured end-to-end at the system level, with sustained utilization improvements, when power is truly the limiting constraint; and where demand elasticity supports revenue growth rather than price erosion. For investors and operators, the actionable takeaway is to judge vendors by factory economics, not chip specs alone. The durable winners will be those who compound efficiency and utilization year after year, with software and fabrics carrying as much weight as silicon — while ensuring the efficiency margins accrue to the operator, not just the supplier.

RTÉ Sport contributor Munster lifted the Vodafone Women's Interprovincial Championship trophy for the first time since January 2023, delivering a dominant performance to beat Leinster 50-15 at Energia Park. It was a disappointingly one-sided final, but that should not take away from Munster's sizzling seven-try display as they cruised past the three-in-a-row hopefuls Leinster, even without injured top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru and vice-captain Stephanie Nunan. A barnstorming first-half performance from Matt Brown's side had them leading 31-0 at the break, with Chloe Pearse, in her final appearance in red, Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (2), and Aoife Corey sharing out the tries. Centre Caitríona Finn, the player-of-the-match for the third time in the Championship, tallied up 20 points in all, really stamping her mark on the game after only making her first senior start for Munster three weeks ago. Tries from Munster captain Maeve Óg O'Leary, Finn, and Eilís Cahill made it 50 unanswered points, before Leinster, whose new head coach Ben Martin handed out 20 debuts across the four-match series, gained some late consolation. Harder hit by their Rugby World Cup representation, and perhaps also by last week's tough encounter with Connacht, the defending champions rallied with tries from replacement Katie Whelan (63 and 73 minutes), and Vicky Elmes Kinlan (80). Munster, who had already won 33-22 in Donnybrook in round 2, lost both O'Leary and Gráinne Burke to the sin bin during the final quarter, but their efforts over the opening hour had made certain of a clean sweep of victories, and their 16th Interprovincial crown overall. The title winners' tight nucleus of senior players, led by inspirational back rower O'Leary, who had a fantastic return to the Interprovincial stage after two knee surgeries, combined very effectively with their emerging young talent this summer.

It’s Labor Day weekend, which means big deals on car lots across America – especially if you’re shopping for a new electric vehicle to help with your labor. We’ve rounded up the best offers on electric pickups, vans, and even a great option for ride share drivers! Sure, there’s a bit of irony in pitching “work vehicles” on a holiday meant for not working – but for many small business owners, work is part of who they are. And with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire, plus a wave of great Labor Day deals on work-ready EVs, now might be the best time yet to plug into a new electric ride. Here are some of the standout electric vehicles offers we found this Labor Day weekend (2025), organized by vehicle type. The “Ford for America,” summer sales event continues through Labor Day with interest-free 0% financing, $0 down payment, and zero payments for up to 90 days for retail customers. Ford is also throwing in $0 maintenance for 24 months. But wait, there’s more! Ford Authority is reporting that a complimentary home charger and standard installation might also be included as part of the Ford Power Promise promotion happening at participating dealers in select markets with the purchase of a new F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of September. Lease customers aren’t being left out, either. You can lease a 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT 4P 311A pickup at $399 per month for 36 months, with “just” $399 due at signing (basically your first month’s payment). The best electric vehicle deal in the business keeps on truckin’ into Labor Day weekend, with new 2025 Brightdrop models currently eligible for up to $21,500 in manufacturer rebates before any Federal, state, local utility, or even Costco membership incentives kick in. For your money, you get a capable, Ultium-based electric cargo van with more room than your college dorm and a nationwide dealer network to keep it up and running when you need it most. Despite being based on the company’s existing diesel platform, Mercedes’ eSprinter has proven itself a capable urban hauler in the hands of Amazon, DHL, and countless European tradespeople. Despite that, there are still a handful of leftover 2024 models hanging around dealer lots – enough that Mercedes is offering up to $30,000 (!) Customer Cash on any new ’24MY eSprinter purchased from dealer stock. That discount is enough to bring the price of this 2024 eSprinter in Chicago from $87,823 all the way down to $57,823 this Labor Day weekend – and that’s before you factor in state and local utility incentives that can bring the price down even further. As you can imagine, there’s some fine print on that Customer Cash deal. It can’t be combined with Special APR programs through Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS), but it can be combined with the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles Medium Fleet Program. Ride share drivers looking for comfortable seats, room for five adults and their luggage, proven battery life, and lickety-quick charging speeds can stop looking. Volkswagen is offering a sweet ID.4 lease at nearly half the cost of an entry-level Jetta with payments starting at just $129/mo. – that’s despite the ID.4 carrying a significantly higher MSRP. And, while we’re at it, it’s probably worth noting that serious road warriors will probably save more than $129/mo. in fuel alone. If you prefer to own your vehicles after making payments on them for a few years, you can also get 0% interest financing on select ID.4s for up to 72 months. It’s important to note here that Volkswagen’s deals can vary wildly by region. That $129/mo. offer is available in California and a few other West Coast states, for example, but the electric crossover’s listed at $329 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing in others. Disclaimer: the vehicle models and financing deals above were sourced from CarsDirect, CarEdge, and (where mentioned) the OEM websites – and were current as of 29AUG2025. These deals may not be available in every market, with every discount, or for every buyer (the standard “with approved credit” fine print should be considered implied).

Can Ethereum sustain its dominance over all altcoin sectors, or is this outperformance nearing its limit? Ethereum outperformed other altcoin sectors as supply shrank and whale bets mounted. With transactions hitting records and ETH rebounding, the question remains: can this momentum spark a sustained rally? Ethereum [ETH] traded higher on the daily chart, logging modest gains over the past 24 hours. The altcoin continued to steer the season, extending its outperformance against Bitcoin [BTC]. The altcoin’s rally has been fueled by whale and institutional accumulation, with retail also joining the train. Most of the altcoin sectors had, however, shifted back to closing in the red. Comparing ETH to other altcoin sectors, it showed clear leadership this month. ETH led with a performance reading of 0.20, slightly higher than those of Layer 2s (L2) and DeFi tokens. By mid-August, DeFi and L2s briefly led, but ETH reclaimed the lead into month-end. Naturally, DePin and AI tokens trailed just below. Source: Glassnode As Q3 2025 closed in, sectors such as gaming, AI, and staking posted losses. In fact, Ethereum stood out as the leader of capital rotation. On the weekly price action, ETH wicked to $4,900 before rejection. The spike signaled a potential rally, breaking a double top near $4,000. Recent price action tested the $4,400 zone, a recovery from the dip below $4,300. As of press time, ETH was only up by about 13%. Source: TradingView If ETH advanced toward $4,800, large liquidation clusters could trigger resets. On top of that, $7.23 billion in ETH short positions risked a squeeze, potentially propelling the price toward $5,000. Additionally, the supply of Ethereum was shrinking with whales, institutions, and retail scooping up more ETH. In fact, staking contributed to the supply shock, with nearly 30% of ETH staked. BlackRock reportedly accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of ETH over a week. Meanwhile, a whale went long on Hyperliquid with 25x leverage at $4,380, building a $4.39 million position, per CryptOpus.

Title: AI Is Golden or ‘Not Rational’: Wall Street’s Battle With Which Road to Take

As investments in artificial intelligence continue to soar, some analysts are raising alarms about a looming bubble that could burst and trigger broader market declines. Others, however, say they’ve never been so sure that it is a growing opportunity. So who is right? Well, on Wall Street, there’s a pick-your-flavor opinion for whatever it is you want to back, so we can’t determine that. But we can show you what each side is thinking. Firstly, that the sector is overvalued. Analysts and investors and even company CEOs of AI giants have expressed concerns that current valuations of AI-related stocks may be disconnected from their underlying fundamentals. The rapid rally in companies involved in AI hardware, software, and infrastructureâincluding chipmakers, cloud providers, and automation firmsâhas driven valuations to levels that many consider unsustainable. Why does that matter? Because everything that goes up must eventually come down. That means that recent market volatility and warnings from veteran investors suggest that a sudden reassessment of valuations could result in a significant downturn, similar to past technology and internet bubbles. Secondly, that growth is why those valuations are worth it. Despite recent concerns about overvaluation and a possible slowdown in AI-related growth, UBS analysts reaffirmed their positive outlook on the sector this week, buoyed by Nvidiaâs hotly anticipated quarterly results. In a note released after Nvidia reported earnings that exceeded expectations (but only just barely), UBS said that the core case for AI investment remains intact. âWhile valuations might appear stretched in the short term, the fundamental need for AI technology across industries continues to grow,â UBS wrote in a note to investors. The firm highlighted Nvidiaâs role as a leader in semiconductor and AI infrastructure, emphasizing that the companyâs robust revenue growth, which is projected at 48% for the current quarter, is a sign for ongoing demand for AI hardware and software solutions. Analysts also pointed out that the broader enterprise move toward integrating AI is supported by increasing capital spending, which bodes well for the sectorâs long-term prospects. âInvestors should maintain conviction,â UBS added, âas the demand for scalable, high-performance AI platforms is only poised to accelerate.â Market experts agree that while short-term volatility is inevitable, the fundamental structural drivers, such as the adoption of AI in cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and enterprise AI, suggest the sectorâs growth story remains robust for the foreseeable future. Not everyone is as bullish on AI as UBS. Take OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a man who is watching billions of dollars being poured into his competitors. Altman caused a major market rout when he said that investors are getting “over-excited” about AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over-excited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,” He toldÂ The Verge, adding that he thinks that some valuations of AI start-ups are “insane” and “not rational”. Investors are also increasingly wary after reports that Meta is considering a âdownsizingâ of its artificial intelligence division, with some executives expected to depart. This potential shift marks a notable departure from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergâs recent heavy investments in transforming the companyâs AI operations. Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has championed a major overhaul of Metaâs AI strategy, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing user experience and competing with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The New York Times cited sources close to the company, indicating that the restructuring could lead to significant layoffs or a shakeup in leadership. The planned changes have raised questions among market watchers about whether Metaâs aggressive AI ambitions are being reassessed, or if internal challenges are forcing a strategic pivot. The move signals a period of uncertainty for Metaâs AI efforts, which had been a key part of Zuckerbergâs vision for the companyâs future growth While some experts acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they caution investors to remain vigilant and avoid chasing speculative gains that lack proper valuation. âThe risk is that we are in a man-made bubble that will eventually burst, causing widespread damage,â said industry veteran Michael Johnson. “Even when the dotcom bubble burst, there were a handful of fairly obvious winners that eventually came roaring back,” saidÂ CNBC‘s Jim Cramer. “If you gave up on Amazon in 2001, you missed the $2 trillion (Â£1.4 trillion) boat.” Cramer has been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission at least once, and has also drawn criticism for past comments on market manipulation. artificial intellienceemerging technologies Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Samsung announced another Unpacked event, a Pixel 10 battery feature you can't turn off, Nothing gets caught in the middle of a stock photo scandal, Samsung XR headset's launch could be on the horizon, and everything we know so far about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE. Read more here Samsung announced this week that it will launch another set of devices soon at its Virtual Unpacked event on Sept 4 at 5 p.m. ET. We may have an idea of what is ahead of us, considering the leaks that have been coming in; however, the teaser hints at nothing more than the arrival of "new" devices. So far, we've had official launches for the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite. Both products have joined Samsung's budget-friendly offerings, and they will also be showcased during this event. Additionally, we've been seeing rumors about a Galaxy S25 FE, another budget phone, as well as the Galaxy Tab S11, along with an alleged Ultra version. We have a pretty packed lineup ahead of us, and the curtain rises next week! Those interested can watch from the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung.com, or the company's YouTube channel. Read more here Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Google's new flagship is here, but here's the catch: apparently, this time around, the tech giant says the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/XL have a battery feature that's locked and loaded onto the device that users can't disable. The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the Google Pixel 9a, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage. This feature activates after 200 charge cycles on the Pixel 10 series. Google claims this slow adjustment helps the battery age more evenly and maintain stable performance over time. While this should make your battery last longer, it will also gradually lower your phone's charging speed. This means your device would need to be plugged into the charger for longer, which is a bummer. Read more here Nothing has been caught in the middle of a messy controversy over its marketing of the Phone 3. The tech company was recently spotted using stock images by professional photographers on different cameras, as shots taken on the Phone 3. Android Authority seems to have narrowed down five images that were supposedly captured by their new flagship devices, but were actually licensed photos. The images in question were licensed stock photos and not, as the company stated, "what our community has captured with the Phone (3)." Android Central also received an anonymous tip that showcased a screen recording of a Live Demo Unit (LDU) and screenshots of images reportedly taken by the device. The tipster claimed that these images were not authentic, but rather stock photos, backing their claim with links to the Stills platform. Akis Evangelidis, the co-founder of Nothing, took to X to post a lengthy statement, effectively agreeing to the fact that these images were indeed stock photographs, but he clarified that this was an "unfortunate oversight." Read more here According to a new report (via UploadVR and Google Translate), Samsung will allegedly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in Korea on September 29, where it'll finally launch Samsung's long-awaited project Moohan. The headset recently passed through certification at the Korea Testing & Research Institute, and will launch "sequentially in global markets" starting in Korea on October 13. As for its price, the report claims the headset could cost around 4 million won, or 1 million short of the Apple Vision Pro. Depending on regional pricing, which is about $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the Meta Quest 3. We were able to demo Project Moohan at Google I/O, and it basically exceeded expectations with its "immersive visuals and natural navigation through apps via Gemini voice commands. It felt comfortably balanced with a knob fitting it in place, gesture controls were seamless, and app performance was speedy," AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks added. Read more here A German publication, Nieuwe Mobiel, spotted an early online listing of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 FE on a Portuguese website. The website named MediaMarkt uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, ahead of its alleged Sept. 4 launch. The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters that provided more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the S25 FE is expected to be "thinner and lighter. The phone is said to feature a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing approximately 190 grams, which is around 20 grams lighter than its predecessor. The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other specifications of the device are expected to include a triple camera array and thinner bezels. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Title: Crypto ETF Surge Could Reshape Market, but Many Products May Fail

A deluge of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could hit U.S. markets as early as this fall, potentially changing how both institutional and retail investors access the digital asset space. But while some see it as a turning point for mainstream adoption, others are already bracing for inevitable casualties. “The crypto ETF floodgates are set to open this fall, and investors will soon be swimming in these products,” said Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management. He believes most of the 90-plus crypto ETF applications currently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be approved — assuming they meet the final listing requirements. Ultimately, though, said Geraci, investors — not regulators — will decide which products thrive. “The beautiful aspect of the ETF market is that it’s a meritocracy, where investors vote with their hard-earned money. The market naturally sorts out the winners from the losers, so I’m not overly concerned about there being too many crypto ETFs floating around.” To Geraci, the demand for more diverse and accessible investment options is already there — and underappreciated. “Given the initial response to futures-based and 1940 Act-structured Solana and XRP ETFs, I believe demand for 1933 Act spot products in these crypto assets is being severely underestimated – much like we saw with spot bitcoin and ether ETFs,” he said. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed and issued by BlackRock, became the most successful ETF launch in the history of those vehicles, now holding nearly $85 billion worth of bitcoin on behalf of investors. While the ether ETFs initially saw much smaller demand than their bitcoin counterparts, a recent surge in interest in the Ethereum blockchain’s native token has seen inflows for the group well surpass those for bitcoin ETFs. Ether ETFs have taken in nearly $10 billion since the start of July, which represents the bulk of total inflows of $14 billion since their launch last year, according to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Geraci also anticipates strong uptake for index-based crypto ETFs, which he says will give investors and advisors “a straightforward way to gain exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem.” For smaller, less-known tokens, he admits demand will depend heavily on the strength of each project’s fundamentals. “As you move further down the crypto market cap spectrum, I expect demand for spot ETFs will be more closely tied to the success of individual projects and the performance of their underlying assets — factors that are difficult to forecast at this stage,” he said. Seyffart agrees that the pipeline of crypto-related products is about to burst — but he’s more skeptical about how many will stick. “If all of those filings ultimately launch, there will undoubtedly be some closures within the next few years,” Seyffart said. He expects “decent demand for plenty of these products,” but believes expectations need to be calibrated—especially for altcoins. “I’m not sure that some of these longer tail altcoins will be able to have 5+ successful ETFs,” he said. “If people are gauging their success on the level of bitcoin ETFs — they will be severely disappointed. But if others are expecting all of them to fail — they will also be severely disappointed.” In his view, the market is entering a test phase where issuers will throw many products at the wall to see what sticks. “These issuers are gonna launch a lot of products and try to find something that sticks,” Seyffart said. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see “hundreds of crypto-related ETP launches.” Both analysts agree on a central point: the ETF format creates a highly competitive landscape where investor interest is the ultimate arbiter of success. While SEC approval might open the gates, it’s asset flows that will determine who stays afloat. In the ETF world, product closures are a feature — not a flaw. Just like in the stock market, low demand or poor performance can lead funds to shut down. For investors, that means not every new crypto ETF will be worth betting on, even if it carries the name of a popular blockchain project. For example, a Solana ETF might find buyers if the underlying token continues to attract developers and users. But five separate ETFs based on the same coin? That’s where both Seyffart and Geraci say the market will likely intervene. “If demand doesn’t show up, those products will close,” Seyffart said. Behind this boom is the broader institutional acceptance of crypto. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last year, asset managers have rushed to file new offerings tied to Solana SOL$206.61, XRP, dogecoin DOGE$0.2121 and many others and even basket funds tracking multiple coins. These products give traditional investors a regulated way to access crypto markets without setting up wallets or managing private keys. But with that access comes the responsibility to be discerning. “In the end, investors will decide which products make sense and which don’t,” Geraci said. “That’s how the ETF market has always worked.” And with hundreds of crypto funds potentially hitting the market soon, that decision may need to come quickly.

August 30, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Ken Paxton's attack on investors is climate change denial, not conservatism

Time Published: 2025-08-30T12:03:46Z

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton revealed first to 'The Ingraham Angle' that he'll be campaigning for U.S. Senate. Each summer and fall, southern states brace for the destructive force of hurricane season. From Florida to the Carolinas, families face a routine ritual: prepare and pray. But the storms are becoming stronger. The flooding is now more severe, and the economic toll increases every year. In 2024, the United States endured 27 separate weather and climate disasters costing a combined $182.7 billion – one of the costliest years on record. As former Republican congressmen who represented southern districts in Florida and South Carolina, climate change isn’t abstract. Miami is seeing rising tides. North Carolina has been battered by torrential flooding. Energy grids have buckled under record-breaking heat. These risks are real, and they are reshaping our economy, insurance markets and communities. RICK PERRY SAYS KEN PAXTON'S ENERGY LAWSUIT WILL HURT US COAL COMPANIES That is why conservatives must reclaim the climate conversation. Sadly, today’s debate is too often dominated by the loudest partisan voices. On the far left, some prescribe sweeping mandates and federal micromanagement that threaten innovation and growth. On the far right, others—ironically in the name of conservatism—are turning the tools of government against private companies, punishing them for evaluating the financial impacts of climate risk. Take Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. He claims these firms formed an "investment cartel" by coordinating their consideration of climate risk, effectively conspiring to disadvantage coal producers and traditional energy companies. But that framing badly misrepresents reality. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, coal production increased during the very period Paxton points to — undermining his claim of an anti-energy conspiracy. What he calls collusion is, in fact, routine fiduciary judgment: investors weighing risks and making portfolio choices. That’s not a cartel. That’s an efficient market working as it should. Assessing risk, whether from hurricanes, regulation, or technological disruption, is the essence of responsible investing. If an asset manager concludes that coastal real estate is more vulnerable to flooding, or that insurance payouts are skyrocketing in certain regions, adjusting portfolios accordingly isn’t "woke capitalism." It’s their fiduciary duty. It’s to safeguard the value of their portfolios. It’s exactly how free markets are supposed to function. Some of Texas’s most respected conservative leaders see this clearly. Rick Perry, former governor and energy secretary during the first Trump administration, has criticized Attorney General Paxton’s lawsuit, warning that weaponizing state power against investors undermines the very energy agenda conservatives claim to support. Perry has rightly argued that free markets, not lawsuits and political intimidation, are the best way to ensure American energy security and economic resilience. He argues true freedom means defending the right of businesses and investors to assess risk as they see fit. (Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Conservatives have long championed the principles of limited government and individual liberty. But when politicians intervene to dictate investment strategies or intimidate firms for recognizing climate risks, they abandon those very principles. The real conservative position is simple: the freedom to invest must be protected. American investors and companies must be able to manage all business risks and opportunities to remain profitable and competitive. Across the country, center-right voices are beginning to step up and lead on this issue. Institutions like the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, R Street, and federal and state lawmakers are demonstrating how market-based approaches can preserve freedom, drive innovation, and prepare our communities for the realities of climate change. We will all convene later this month in New York City to share how conservatives can chart a path forward. BlackRock offices. (Wikipedia) This is not about choosing between the environment and the economy. It is about unleashing American ingenuity to confront financial risks, create opportunities, and strengthen resilience. Conservatives should be the ones insisting that the marketplace — not government mandates — decides how to adapt and invest for the future. The stakes are clear. If we cede the conversation, the public will be left with a false choice between big-government mandates from the left and big-government meddling from the right. Both are wrong. Conservatives must stand for freedom. For families rebuilding after storms, for entrepreneurs developing clean technologies, and for investors responsibly assessing risks. Here in America, we must firmly defend the freedom to invest. Republican Bob Inglis represented South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District from 1993 to 1999 and then again from 2005 until 2011.

Title: All 7 new products we’re expecting Apple to announce at its ‘Awe Dropping’ September event

Time Published: 2025-08-30T11:03:00Z
Full Content:
Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, where the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15-19% so far in 2025, making it the one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s September 9 event will reportedly be the ultra-thin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultra-thin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly only include a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is only capable of 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with standalone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity, and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved Active Noise Cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The September 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation roadmap represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s roadmap reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro roadmap includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, September 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, pre-orders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching on week later: In this case, that would mean pre-orders opening on September 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on September 19. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: All 7 new products we’re expecting Apple to announce at its ‘Awe Dropping’ September event

Manage your account ... Apple may unveil as many as seven new products at its Sept. 9 “Awe Dropping” event, including the ultrathin iPhone 17 Air that could replace the iPhone Plus line. The company is also expected to introduce health-focused updates across its Apple Watch and AirPods lineups, marking a significant hardware refresh amid ongoing challenges in artificial intelligence competition. Apple’s Sept. 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, in which the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15% to 19% so far in 2025, making it the one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s Sept. 9 event will reportedly be the ultrathin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultrathin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly include only a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is capable of only 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with stand-alone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Ripple CEO Predicts $25T Crypto Market by 2030

The total crypto market cap has grown by nearly 400% in the last three years, from $727B in October 2022 to a staggering $3.72T at the time of writing. That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Keep reading to discover why Ripple’s boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple’s own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now. Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they’re built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can’t match. As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years. All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto’s long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we’re seeing now. In fact, now’s the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year, proving there’s so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in. As a result, you’ll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT, you’re positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. What’s Maxi Doge, really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin. But the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome’ Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings. That’s when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’, the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.’ For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH. More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle,’ Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn’t as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week’s range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle’ pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. With Ripple’s CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto’s valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT, $MAXI, and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky. Also, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: The wine business is in crisis but these whites might be the thing to save it

The wine business is going through something of a crisis at the moment as worldwide consumption maintains a steady downward curve. According to the OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine), sales in 2024 are estimated to have been 214.2 million hectolitres – a decrease of 3.3 per cent from 2023. This would be the lowest volume recorded since 1961. According to EU figures, France alone is drinking 65 per cent less than in the 1960s. However, the decrease has been mainly in red wines. Sales of white, rosé and sparkling wines have been steady, even increasing slightly in some years. There is some evidence that growers in traditionally red wine regions such as Bordeaux are ripping up their red vines and planting white instead. Millennials and Gen Z are the key groups here. Instead of sitting down to long dinners accompanied by red wine, they prefer to drink wine by itself or with plates and side dishes. They are aware of the dangers of alcohol, and drink selectively, on special occasions. They prefer organic or sustainable drinks and want to know about the producer. Social media influences drinking patterns and choices. In general the two groups prefer lighter white, or rosé wines with good acidity, plenty of aromas and a bit of texture; wines that will go with the variety of flavours that comes with a mix of small plates and side dishes. They enjoy colourful labels and low-intervention wines. They are also drinking more cocktails, craft beers, low- or no-alcohol drinks, and enjoy ready-to-drink (RTD) and canned cocktails. This week, I present four wines that should appeal to millennials, Gen Z and the rest of us too. This sustainably produced wine is fresh with a vibrant acidity and succulent mouthwatering peach fruits. To drink with fish, creamy chicken and pork dishes. Excellent value for money. Dunnes A light, aromatic and refreshing sauvignon with some nice rich exotic fruits on the palate. Perfect for sipping or with mixed snacks.

Title: High prices expected for New York sapphires
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/08/30/high-prices-expected-for-new-york-sapphires/

Provenance and rarity are two of the elements that add value to antique jewellery. And, in the forthcoming jewellery auction at Adam’s on September 9th, these will come together, with the sale of two Kashmir sapphires, each set in early 20th-century brooches. Readers of this column may remember how, in May, a rare Kashmir sapphire was sold under the hammer at Adam’s for €550,00 (€660,000 including all fees). At that time the sale made front-page news as it was the highest price paid in Ireland for a gem of its kind. “It was a record-breaking price for a piece of jewellery sold at auction in Ireland and one of the highest prices per carat fetched at auction worldwide in recent years,” says Claire-Laurence Mestrallet, head of jewellery and watches at Adam’s. Kashmir sapphires from the rugged Zanskar range of the Himalayan mountains in Kashmir in northwest India are the rarest and most sought after sapphires in the world. This is partly because the mine in which they originated was completely depleted of the gemstones less than a decade after their discovery in 1881. The rarity of these two brooches now for sale – one with a cushion-shaped sapphire with a double frame of old European single-cut diamonds (estimate €150,000-€250,000), and the other an oval sapphire within a frame of old-cut diamonds (€200,000-€300,000), has been confirmed by two prominent laboratories in Switzerland – the Swiss Gemmological Institute and the Gübelin laboratory. However, it is their provenance that is arguably more interesting. The brooches were gifted to May Emily Sands by her New Yorker parents, Benjamin Aymar Sands and Amy Kirby Akin, upon her marriage to Hugh Melville Howard in September 1908. Howard was the younger son of Fanny Catherine Wingfield and her husband, the sixth earl of Wicklow, whose ancestral seat was Shelton Abbey in Co Wicklow. “The marriage of the daughter of Benjamin Aymar Sands, himself the son of a well-known New York banker, brought together a bond of American society and European aristocracy,” says Mestrallet. The Sands family was one of the original settlers on Long Island and gave their name to Sands Point. The opulence of old-money families and the scenic coastal views in the area are believed to have inspired the fictional East Egg location in F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. If aristocratic lineage, or indeed privileged New Yorkers at the turn of the 20th century, isn’t your thing, how the brooches have ended up in a Dublin auction might be. “Hugh died of pneumonia at a young age and May developed psychological problems and was institutionalised. Their two children, Katherine and Cecil, went to live with their uncle, the seventh earl of Wicklow, at Shelton Abbey,” says Mestrallet. And while Cecil Howard returned to live in Manhattan, Katharine Howard remained in Ireland and bought Ounavarra House and farm in Co Wexford. Throughout her life, she contributing to many worthy causes, and the Katharine Howard Foundation was later set up in her memory. She was godmother to the current owner of the brooches, whose name Mestrallet won’t reveal. Meanwhile, Adam’s Blackrock is also hosting an online jewellery auction, which ends on Wednesday, September 10th. An 18-carat gold bracelet made by the Italian brand Marco Bicego is among the exquisite pieces. It is composed of no less than 20 delicate fine-link strands of 18-carat gold, each of which is set with “pebbles” of gold (€3,000-€4,000). And, Morgan O’Driscoll is hosting his first online jewellery auction, which ends on Monday, September 8th. The sale- which have been curated by gemmologist, Colin Weldon, has lots of luxurious earrings, necklaces, bracelets, including the “tutti-frutti’ gem-set bracelet (€40,000-€60,000), with a mix of diamonds and carved and smooth-domed gemstones. The sale also includes a 17th-century enamel diamond and emerald stomacher pendant (€30,000-€40,000). A stomacher is a piece of jewellery that was worn at the centre of the panel in the bodice of a dress. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, stomachers became large eye-catching pieces of jewellery worn for formal occasions. Finally, provenance and rarity also come to the fore in the book sale of the entire library of the late Tommy Smith at Purcell’s Auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, on September 3rd and 4th. Smith co-owned Grogan’s pub on South William Street, Dublin, very popular with artists and writers. “Tommy befriended many of Ireland’s leading writers and poets and their publications – many of which are signed and dedicated to Tommy – make up a very large proportion of this sale,” says Conor Purcell. He points to Patrick Kavanagh’s Tarry Flynn (Devin Adair, New York, 1949) as one of the most intriguing items for sale, as it is the actual copy used in the infamous libel court case involving Patrick Kavanagh in the 1950s. “During cross-examination, Kavanagh denied that he and Brendan were friends – upon which a copy of Kavanagh’s book Tarry Flynn was given in evidence, with attention drawn to his inside cover inscription: “For Brendan, poet and painter, on the day he decorated my flat, Sunday, 12th, 1950” explains Purcell. The book has an estimate of €3,000-€6,000. adams.ie adamsblackrock.com morganodriscoll.com purcellauctioneers.ie Estimate €500-€1,000 Hammer price €750 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €1,500-€2,500 Hammer price €3,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate $30,000-$40,000 Hammer price $40,000 (€34,120) Auction house Sotheby’s New York Estimate $2,400-$4,000 Hammer price $2,500 (€3,500) Auction house Sotheby’s New York © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

AT THE END of June, the United Nations released a new report which denounced 48 companies it claimed had profited from “the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid, and [...] genocide” in Palestine. The report by the UN’s Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, claimed that “far too many” companies had profited from the decades-long conflict. Albanese called for these companies to end their complicity in “human rights violations and international crimes” or “be held to account”. Earlier this week, Norway’s wealth fund made headlines when it divested from Caterpillar – one of the companies on the list – over the use of its machinery by Israel to demolish Palestinian properties in the West Bank and Gaza. But the country is not the only one whose sovereign wealth fund invests in companies that are named on the UN list. Ireland’s fund, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, maintains direct investments in exactly a quarter of the 48 companies, which are valued at almost €97 million. Who are these companies and why are they named on the list? ISIF investment value: €440,000 Airbnb is one of two accommodation websites listed in the report, and was named for listing properties and hotel rooms in illegal Israeli settlements. The Journal Investigates previously searched Airbnb and found a number of listings for properties that are based in settlements in the West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. These listings – and Airbnb’s attempts to stop featuring them – have prompted a number of legal actions against the company. In the US and Israel, Airbnb has found itself at the centre of a legal challenge over its decision to remove around 200 listings for accommodation in West Bank settlements that it said “are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians”. It settled four of those legal challenges and reversed its decision to remove the properties the following year. The company said at the time that it would instead donate all profits from its listings in the occupied West Bank to “non-profit organisations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world”. The Journal contacted Airbnb Inc for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. Recent statements given by the company to other news outlets have pointed to its donation of profits from host activity in the West Bank to an international charity. ISIF investment value: €21.54 million Alphabet Inc, better known as the parent company of Google, was named in the report as one of four tech giants which are deemed central to “Israel’s surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction”. It claims that Alphabet also grants Israel “virtually government-wide access” to its cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, which allow Israel to enhance its processing of data and surveillance capacities against Palestinians. The report also outlines how the company was awarded a $1.2 billion (€1.03 billion) contract in 2021, alongside Amazon, to provide cloud tech infrastructure to Israel’s government and military. Google workers openly protested against the contract last year, because they demanded to know whether their labour was being used as part of Israel’s war on Gaza. The Journal contacted Alphabet for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. In previous statements to other outlets, Alphabet has said that its contract for Project Nimbus “is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”. It also said that the company works with governments around the world. ISIF investment value: €790,000 German insurance company Allianz was named in the report for investing in shares and bonds which Albanese claimed are “implicated in the occupation and genocide”. The report claims that Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion (€6.3 billion) in these investments, which it says are made partly as policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but whose primary focus is to generate returns. The report also claims that Allianz’s policies underwrite risks taken by other companies which operate in illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. As well as this, the report names Allianz’s asset management subsidiary Pimco as one of 400 investors to have purchased Israeli state bonds that have financed the country’s war in Gaza. Earlier this month, 800 current and former GAA players signed an open letter calling on the organisation to end its partnership with Allianz over its link to the war in Gaza. A spokesperson for Allianz Ireland was contacted by The Journal and the company declined to comment. ISIF investment value: €23.53 million Like Alphabet, Amazon is named in the report as one of four tech giants that the UN special rapporteur deems central to Israel’s surveillance apparatus and the destruction of Gaza. It also holds part of the $1.2 billion (€1.03 billion) Project Nimbus contract to provide advanced AI and machine-learning capabilities to the Israeli government. And it was also among the companies that provided the Israeli internal military with necessary cloud and AI tech after the IDF’s cloud system overloaded in October 2023. The company’s e-commerce platform Amazon.com is also named for operating directly in illegal Israeli settlements, which the report says helps to both sustain the economy of the settlements and to enable their expansion. The Journal contacted Amazon for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. The company does not appear to have addressed its appearance in the UN report to date. ISIF investment value: €2.24 million Unlike other companies on the list, which tend to operate in Israel or illegal settlements or have contracts with Israel’s defence industry, asset management firm BlackRock is named as one of several companies deemed to finance “Israeli occupation and genocide”. The New York based firm is specifically named in the report because the UN says it is “among the largest investors in arms companies pivotal to the genocidal arsenal of Israel”. It is considered to have done this by purchasing bonds that are deemed to have “a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza” and for holding shares in companies that are alleged to be “implicated in the occupation and genocide” in Gaza. This includes significant investments in a number of the companies named in the report (which also feature in this article), such as Palantir, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, IBM, Lockheed Martin and Caterpillar. A spokesperson for BlackRock was contacted by The Journal, but the company declined to comment. ISIF investment value: €1.04 million Advertisement Booking Holdings, the company behind the Dutch-based accommodation company Booking.com, was named in the report for listing properties and hotel rooms in illegal Israeli settlements. It noted that Booking.com more than doubled its listings in West Bank settlements from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023. The Journal Investigates previously browsed Booking.com and was able to find hundreds of listings for hotels and guesthouses based in settlements in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and occupied East Jerusalem. The company announced in September 2022 that it would start adding safety guidance to any listings in the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, including guidance that the reservations are “occupied”. It subsequently backtracked on this policy the following month after pressure from the Israeli government, and instead opted to use the term “conflict-affected” in its warnings. The Journal contacted Booking.com for comment for this article, but received no response by the time of publication. The company told this publication for a previous article about its activities in the occupied territories that it believed it was “not our place to decide where someone can or cannot travel”. ISIF investment value: €260,000 Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, features throughout the report for providing machinery and equipment used by Israel to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure. The company is well-known for producing machines like excavators and bulldozers, as well as industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The UN report claims that Caterpillar’s products have been used to carry out “mass demolitions” of homes, mosques and other infrastructure, as well as the raiding of hospitals, and burying wounded Palestinians alive. The report further claims that Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into a piece of “automated, remote-commanded core weaponry” of its military. It says this has been deployed “in almost every military activity since 2000″, such as clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralising’ Palestinian territory and killing Palestinians. The company was contacted for comment by The Journal, but no response was received by the time of publication. Caterpillar has not yet commented on its inclusion in the report, or the decision of Norway’s wealth fund to divest from the company over the use of its bulldozers in the destruction of Palestinian homes. ISIF investment value: €1.38 million The Japanese Fanuc Corporation is one of the lesser-known names on the list, in which the ISIF maintains a seven-figure investment. The corporation is a group of companies that provide automation products and services like robotics and wireless computer systems. It is mentioned just once in the report in a section about companies which facilitate the arms trade in Israel – though Fanuc appears to do this indirectly. The UN claims that the corporation provides robotic machinery for the weapons production lines of manufacturers such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin, all of which are named as being pivotal to Israel’s violence against Palestinians in Gaza and in illegal settlements. In response to the report, a spokesperson for Fanuc told The Journal that there are “no records of sales or services for military use being conducted by our company or our European subsidiaries to Israeli companies”. It added that in the event that Fanuc sells products or services destined for Israel, the company conducts necessary screening in accordance with Japanese legislation. “If it is confirmed that the intended use is of a military nature, we do not proceed with the sale,” the company’s spokesperson said. ISIF investment value: €700,000 American tech multinational Hewlett Packard is named in the report for previous, rather than current activities. According to the UN special rapporteur, one part of the company known as Hewlett Packard Enterprises maintained a database for Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority until 2019. The report claimed that this enabled the “collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians” and supported “the discriminatory permit regime of Israel”. A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise told The Journal that the company is “strongly committed to socially responsible business practices” and always has been. The company’s statement continued that it works in markets that are consistent with its “values, standards, and global human rights policy”, adding that it was comfortable that its business with the state of Israel is “in alignment with our human rights policy”. ISIF investment value: €5.94 million Technology company IBM is named in the report for a number of activities, including taking over maintainence of the database for Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority from Hewlett Packard Enterprises. The UN alleges that IBM has collaborated with science and technology faculties in ways that contribute to the production of tools for surveillance, crowd control, urban warfare, facial recognition and targeted killing that are “effectively tested on Palestinians”. IBM was contacted for comment on these allegations, but no response was received by the time of publication. ISIF investment value: €38.01 million Another of the big tech platforms named in the report, Microsoft is named as basing its largest centre outside of the United States in Israel, where it has operated since 1991. The report says that the company’s technologies are “embedded” throughout Israel’s state infrastructure and in illegal settlements, including in the prison service, police force, universities and schools. As with Amazon and Alphabet, the report further alleges that Microsoft has given “virtually government-wide access” to its cloud and AI technologies in ways that allow Israel to enhance data processing and surveillance. It also names Microsoft’s Azure platform as stepping in when the IDF’s cloud system overloaded in October 2023. The Journal contacted Microsoft for comment,and was directed to a blog post from May, in which the company said it took “seriously” concerns that its AI technologies were being used by Israeli military to target civilians in Gaza, though it said it had found “no evidence” that this was happening. The company also said that it would formally review the use of Microsoft Azure by a unit of the IDF, after The Guardian reported the system was used to store data files of phone calls obtained through surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. ISIF investment value: €950,000 Data mining company Palantir, which made headlines here last year after it emerged Social Democrats TD Eoin Hayes held shares in the company, features throughout the UN report. The company has been widely criticised for its involvement with Israel and the conflict in Gaza since the war began. The UN says there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the company has provided Israel with its AI programme and other technologies to enhance the IDF’s decision-making capabilities in real-time. It also points to a strategic partnership that the company has with Israel and how it’s CEO responded to accusations that Palantir had been involved in the killing of Palestinians in Gaza by saying “mostly terrorists, that’s true”. The company did not respond to a request for comment from The Journal. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Major U.S. equities indexes retreated from recent highs as investors digested fresh economic data ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Friday's move lower came after the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—a gauge of inflation closely monitored by the Federal Reserve—showed a month-over-month uptick in "core" PCE inflation in July. The S&P 500 and the Dow declined 0.2% and 0.6%, after closing Thursday at record levels. Underperformance from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 1.2%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) tumbled 8.9%, suffering the heaviest daily loss of any stock in the S&P 500. Although strong demand related to artificial intelligence helped the maker of personal computers, servers, and other IT hardware topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates, Dell's guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below consensus estimates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares dropped 7.1%. The decline reversed solid gains posted by the stock in the prior session. The cosmetics retailer late yesterday posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter and boosted its full-year revenue guidance. Ulta faces continued uncertainty related to potential tariff impacts. Although many stocks with exposure to AI initially gained ground in the wake of the latest earnings report from AI semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), the rally lost steam on Friday. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the enterprise software firm that has recently announced major investments in AI and cloud infrastructure, slipped 5.9%, while shares of AI-focused server manufacturer Super Micro Computer (SMCI) ended 5.5% lower. Autodesk (ADSK) shares bucked the downward pressure on the broader tech sector and software industries, jumping 9.1% to log the S&P 500's top performance. The engineering and design software provider topped second-quarter sales and adjusted profit estimates and lifted its full-year forecasts. Demand for its design software for AI data centers helped underpin the performance. Shares of Cooper Cos. (COO), a medical device maker focused vision care and surgical products, advanced 4.4%. With the move higher heading into the holiday weekend, Cooper stock clawed back a portion of the heavy losses posted Thursday after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates and lowered its full-year sales forecast. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock also staged a recovery on Friday from a post-earnings swoon suffered earlier in the week, adding 3.6%. The maker of its namesake fruit spreads as well as the Hostess snack cake brand reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter and noted that tariffs were having a negative impact on its coffee business. On its earnings call, the company said it anticipates additional price hikes as it navigates tariff-related cost pressure.

Title: BlackRock Ethereum ETF captures second-highest weekly inflows among over 4,400 ETFs

Before this surge, Ethereum ETFs had recorded negative $400 million year-to-date flows, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum (ETH) Trust ETF (ETHA) recorded $1.244 billion in weekly inflows from Aug. 18-22, ranking second among all 4,400-plus ETFs tracked during the period. NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci noted in an Aug. 29 post via X that only Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF outperformed ETHA’s with $1.711 billion in weekly flows. He also highlighted the significance of ETHA appearing among “heavy hitters” in weekly inflow rankings, demonstrating institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure. Further, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported on Aug. 29 that Ethereum ETFs have accumulated nearly $10 billion in inflows since July, marking substantial momentum for the asset class. Before this surge, Ethereum ETFs had recorded negative $400 million year-to-date flows, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion, according to Farside Investors’ data. Market conditions indicate that capital is rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum throughout August. While Bitcoin ETFs registered $800 million in outflows through Aug. 28, Ethereum ETFs accumulated $4 billion in inflows during the same period, per Farside Investors tracking. The inflow disparity reflects evolving institutional preferences as investors diversify cryptocurrency allocations beyond Bitcoin. Additionally, retail participation accelerated in tandem with institutional interest. DeFiLlama data shows that Ethereum achieved a monthly spot trading volume record of $135 billion as of Aug. 29, surpassing the previous high of $117.6 billion from May 2021. The institutional adoption is not limited to exposure through ETFs, as corporate Ethereum adoption accelerated significantly during the summer months. Strategic ETH Reserve data reveals corporate Ethereum treasuries increased from $2.3 billion to $19.1 billion between June 1 and Aug. 29. In token terms, corporate reserves expanded from 916,268 ETH to 4,438,352 ETH over the same period, representing approximately 3.7% of total ETH supply. The treasury accumulation pattern, combined with the increasing number of institutions adding ETH, suggests institutional recognition of Ethereum as a treasury asset. ETHA’s performance demonstrates the integration of Ethereum into mainstream investment flows, with crypto products competing directly against established equity and bond ETFs for investor capital.

The chips are down to close out August. A range of chip stocks slid Friday, weighing on the major U.S. equities indexes in the last trading session of the month. China concerns weighed on the sector, but that wasn't the only factor that pulled shares lower. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) among its biggest decliners. The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.

BitMine Immersion Technologies saw its stock sink nearly 8% this week, yet that didn’t stop Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest from pouring another $15.6 million into the company. The latest move comes during a period of heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets. According to ARK’s trading disclosures on August 27, the firm bought 339,113 BitMine shares spread across three ETFs. The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 227,569 shares valued at a little over $10 million, while the Next Generation Internet ETF added 70,991 shares worth $3.27 million. The Fintech Innovation ETF purchased another 40,553 shares for $1.87 million. Despite this fresh round of buying, BitMine shares ended the day at $46 before sliding 7.80% in extended trading. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 339,113 shares of Tom Lee’s $BMNR today pic.twitter.com/G9SQY02rDg — Tom Lee Tracker (@TomLeeTracker) August 28, 2025 BitMine’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury earlier this summer has transformed the firm into a major corporate player in crypto. Its balance sheet now holds 1,714,000 ETH, worth about $8.20 billion, alongside 192 Bitcoin and $562 million in cash. That makes BitMine the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has also taken a 9% stake, adding more weight to the firm’s rapid rise. According to latest data, the company’s strategy has fueled sharp price movements in its stock. After surging more than 3,000% to a record high of $135 in early July, shares remain up more than 400% year-to-date despite recent pullbacks. Reports have disclosed that BitMine dramatically expanded its fundraising plans. On August 12, the company filed to boost its at-the-market equity offering from $2 billion to $24.5 billion, a move led by Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity. Observers say the new funds will give BitMine more firepower to build its Ethereum position. Analysts projected strong gains for Ethereum, predicting $5,500 in the near term and as high as $12,000 by year-end. If those targets materialize and BitMine pushes toward its 5% supply goal, the company could one day rival Michael Saylor’s Strategy in scale. Social media reaction has been quick to frame BitMine as Ethereum’s version of Strategy — a corporate vehicle for institutional exposure to the asset. ARK’s growing position, surpassing $200 million this summer, only strengthens that concept. Yet the risks are just as visible. BitMine’s share price swings highlight how concentrated bets can move violently, even with billions of dollars on the balance sheet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Governance, Risk & Compliance: 90-Day Plan To Get Digital Assets Ready
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2025/08/29/governance-risk--compliance-90-day-plan-to-get-digital-assets-ready/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T19:38:29Z

ByTonya M. Evans, Contributor. The regulatory landscape for digital assets shifted dramatically in July 2025. President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first federal stablecoin framework. The House passed two additional landmark bills—the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Act—that now head to an uncertain Senate. Meanwhile, 53 banking associations launched coordinated opposition to what they see as competitive threats to traditional deposits. For Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) professionals, this isn't about "crypto" anymore. It's about preparing compliance programs for a fundamental shift in how money and financial services operate. The question isn't whether digital assets will require enterprise-level risk management, it's whether your organization will be ready when full implementation begins in 2027. While crypto advocates celebrated legislative victories, a powerful counterforce mobilized. On August 13, 2025, the American Banking Association and 52 state banking groups sent joint letters to Senate leadership demanding amendments to the GENIUS Act. Their concerns reveal the competitive dynamics GRC professionals must now navigate: Deposit Flight Risk: Treasury estimates suggest stablecoins could drain up to $6.6 trillion from traditional bank deposits. This isn't speculation—it's why your organization's digital asset policies now intersect with liquidity management and treasury operations. Regulatory Arbitrage: Uninsured stablecoin issuers may operate across state lines without the regulatory requirements that apply to federally insured banks. GRC professionals must assess whether their institutions face competitive disadvantages or compliance gaps. Interest Payment Workarounds: Banking groups warn that while the GENIUS Act prohibits direct interest payments on stablecoins, issuers could partner with exchanges to offer indirect yield programs. This creates gray areas that compliance teams must monitor. The crypto industry's $135 million in 2024 election spending focused on fighting regulatory overreach. They underestimated the entrenched political influence of traditional banking, which now represents an organized opposition with deeper institutional relationships and systemic risk arguments that resonate with policymakers. Even the signed GENIUS Act is essentially a legislative architectural blueprint waiting for operational details from the executive branch of the United States government. Federal agencies have until July 18, 2026, to issue implementing regulations, with full compliance required by January 18, 2027. What we still don't know about the GENIUS Act: For the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC Acts, we’re even earlier in the process. If they pass the Senate with amendments, expect another 12-24 month rulemaking period. Even if all goes as planned by the administration, it will be 2027-2028 before any comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework is fully operational. Immediate Risk Assessment Policy Framework Updates Technology and Vendor Assessment Training Program Development Pilot Program Launch Strategic Positioning Regulatory Classification Systems Understanding how assets move between SEC (securities) and CFTC (commodities) oversight under the proposed CLARITY Act framework. This determines examination procedures, registration requirements, and compliance obligations. Reserve and Custody Requirements The GENIUS Act requires 100% reserve backing with liquid assets, but implementing regulations will determine operational details like custody standards, acceptable reserve assets, and reporting requirements. AML/BSA Implications Digital asset transactions create unique challenges for transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and customer identification programs. Blockchain analytics provide new investigative tools but require specialized expertise. Examination Priorities Federal banking agencies will develop examination procedures for institutions with digital asset activities. Early indicators suggest focus on risk management, AML compliance, and consumer protection. Preparing for Regulatory Evolution The current legislative framework provides general outlines, but practical compliance requirements will emerge through: GRC professionals who begin building competency now will have competitive advantages when full implementation begins. Those waiting for "final" rules risk being unprepared for rapidly evolving compliance obligations. Major banks already recognize this shift. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have launched digital asset services while their industry associations lobby against crypto-friendly regulations. This reflects institutional recognition that digital assets represent business opportunities despite competitive concerns about traditional banking models. For GRC professionals, this creates a two-front challenge: preparing for digital asset compliance obligations while navigating industry opposition that may influence final regulatory implementation. Your Competitive Advantage Opportunity Digital asset regulation is moving from regulatory gray areas toward comprehensive federal oversight. The transformation has begun, but it's far from complete. GRC professionals who invest in understanding the emerging regulatory architecture will provide valuable guidance during this transition. Ensure your compliance program will be ready to provide competent, confident guidance when clients need it most. Begin building foundational competency now. Monitor legislative developments closely. Prepare for implementation timelines measured in years, not months. And remember that even when regulations are finalized, the digital asset landscape will continue evolving as markets, technology, and policy priorities change. The smartest GRC professionals are positioning themselves as knowledgeable advisors in the integrated traditional-digital finance economy that's emerging. Your 90-day action plan starts now.

Title: Ripple Swell 2025 Is Almost Here: Here’s What To Expect From The Event

Ripple Swell 2025 is fast approaching, even as members of the XRP community look forward to the bullish announcements that could come at the conference. The crypto firm also unveiled featured speakers at the event, including its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. Ripple has announced that the Swell event will take place in New York from November 4 to 5. Featured speakers include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Co-founder Chris Larsen, President Monica Long, Nasdaq’s Chair Adena Friedman, and renowned chef José Andrés. Executives from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Citi, CME Group, and Franklin Templeton are also set to speak at the event. The Ripple Swell event will cover several topics that touch on the firm’s customers, team members, and industry thought leaders, as well as how financial institutions and businesses are leveraging cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These topics will include tokenization, payments, regional regulatory process, and crypto financial services. These are all topics that Ripple, as a firm, is conversant with, given its operations. The company has secured several partnerships this year to promote tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), including one with Ondo Finance to launch its tokenized treasuries on the network. Meanwhile, Ripple is known for its payment service, which is why the discussion around payments could be very insightful. It is worth noting that the crypto firm is expected to finalize its deal to acquire the stablecoin platform Rail around the time of the Swell event. As such, this could be one of the major talking points during the event. Ripple earlier highlighted why the Rail acquisition was strategic, as it would enable the company to offer virtual accounts and automated back-office infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ripple has had its fair share of dealing with regulators, particularly in light of the XRP lawsuit. As such, the regulatory topic at the Swell event is expected to garner significant attention, as the company’s executives discuss how they have navigated the regulatory landscape. Notably, the company’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, is also one of the featured speakers. In an X post, Ripple revealed that Chris Larsen and José Andrés will be the Keynote speakers at the event. XRP community members such as BankXRP shared their delight at the fact that Larsen will be speaking at the event. BankXRP noted that it has been a while since the Ripple co-founder has made an appearance. On the other hand, community members have questioned why Chef Andrés is speaking at the event and as a keynote speaker. Ripple didn’t reveal what the renowned chef will be speaking on. However, it could relate to the adoption of cryptocurrency in businesses or his humanitarian work, which is a significant development for the firm, considering its philanthropic efforts. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.90, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Cracker Barrel founder, 93, gives damning verdict on $7M-a-year CEO as she breaks cover after rebrand fiasco

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/29/2025 11:50:40 AM PDT by Morgana Cracker Barrel's co-founder has delivered a scathing critique of the restaurant chain's CEO after a botched rebranding. Tommy Lowe, 93, accused Julie Felss Masino of failing to grasp what Cracker Barrel stands for, pointing to her previous stint at Taco Bell. 'They're trying to modernize to be like the competition. Cracker Barrel doesn't have any competition,' Low, who co-founded Cracker Barrel with the late Dan Evins in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1969, told WTVF. 'I heard she was at Taco Bell. What's Taco Bell know about Cracker Barrel and country food? They need to work on the food and service and leave the barrel, the logo, alone.' The criticism comes after Cracker Barrel scrapped its controversial new logo Tuesday following a flood of outrage. The redesign removed the iconic 'Old Timer' figure — an old man leaning against a barrel — leaving only the chain's name in a modern font. Lowe weighed into the saga as Masino, who earns $6.68 million a year in salary and bonuses, was spotted Thursday leaving her home in an affluent Nashville neighborhood. When approached by Fox News Digital, Masino — who took the helm of the 650-location Southern comfort food chain in 2023 — refused to answer questions She quickly got into her Mercedes-Benz, flanked by security in another vehicle, and drove to a nearby Starbucks for coffee.

What's Taco Bell know about Cracker Barrel and country food? This is a big part of the "MBA" problem the country has had for 40 years or so. Once upon a time, someone would start at a company at the bottom. If they were good, they'd move up. Through each level. They would understand warehousing, distribution, marketing, retail, product development, recruiting, contracts, finance, whatever. If they made up to CEO they would understand the company culture and how to manage the company too. But we threw that out the window.

Men’s and woman’s VALUE is inherent by the grace of God based on what Christ did, NOT what they do. Women’s value and worth is not based on their ROLE. But their God-given role of being subject to the man/husband is very important for the family and society. How does one measure a woman’s value or worth?

Men’s and woman’s VALUE is inherent by the grace of God based on what Christ did, NOT what they do. Women’s value and worth is not based on their ROLE. But their God-given role of being subject to the man/husband is very important for the family and society. How does one measure a woman’s value or worth? She is worth the very Son of God who gave his life for her.

Title: Internal tensions rise as Meta races to beat the clock

Good morning from a wet and gloomy London. It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week. Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter. Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service. Now, on to today's big story: BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports on Meta's race against time to launch one of its latest products. What's on deck: Markets: The brands Morgan Stanley's summer interns are splurging on. Tech: Here's who stands to benefit — and who might suffer — from the AI software shakeout. Business: Dollar General is racing to grow its one hour delivery service. But first, the clock is ticking. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI. This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures. Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring. Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations. And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month. We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results. When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions. Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York.

Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected. Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations.

We’ll delve into the specifics of what's driving this momentum and whether this AI growth story has the legs to keep soaring. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? SoundHound AI’s strong revenue growth is far more than a simple market trend; it's the result of a deliberate and powerful three-pronged strategy that has transformed the company from a niche player into a diversified force. The most impactful move was the acquisition of Amelia in August 2024. This wasn't just a bolt-on purchase; it was a game-changing maneuver. By adding Amelia’s mature enterprise AI business and its substantial $45 million in recurring revenue, SoundHound didn't just grow—it supercharged its top line. This single strategic acquisition fundamentally reshaped the company's financial profile, providing a stable, high-value enterprise foundation that its previous business lacked. Historically, SoundHound was heavily reliant on the automotive sector, with over 90% of its revenue tied to a single industry. That dangerous dependency has been shattered. The company has executed a masterful diversification strategy, with well-balanced revenue streams now flowing from automotive, restaurants, financial services, healthcare, and insurance. This critical shift not only mitigates risk but also unlocks a vast array of new revenue streams, proving the company's technology is adaptable and in demand across multiple lucrative sectors. While diversification is key, SoundHound has not abandoned its core. The company has deepened its penetration in the automotive market, forging crucial partnerships with global powerhouses like Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, and Stellantis brands such as Peugeot, Opel, and Alfa Romeo. This isn't just about selling a product; it’s about becoming an integral part of the next generation of in-vehicle technology. The recent broad rollout of its Chat AI to new Stellantis brands across Europe shows that this expansion is ongoing and gaining momentum, solidifying its position in this crucial market. While acquisitions and partnerships are the most visible drivers, a more fundamental force is at play: the company’s proprietary technology and product innovation. SoundHound’s Polaris foundation model and the launch of the Amelia 7.0 agentic AI (acts proactively) platform are key. These platforms offer superior accuracy and lower latency compared to rivals, which is a massive competitive advantage. It's this continuous technological edge that convinces major enterprises and automakers to choose SoundHound and is what allows the company to land new contracts and expand existing relationships. The tangible growth we see is the direct result of a superior product that's winning in the market. SoundHound AI’s valuation has exploded higher. Its price-to-sales ratio has skyrocketed from a rich 10.6x in 2023 to a staggering 37.6x today. This isn't just about revenue growth; it's a story of market frenzy driven by four powerful forces. While SoundHound's revenue surged by 187%, the stock's appreciation has been far more dramatic. The market is paying a premium for what it believes is a hyper-growth story. The projections of another 35% growth in 2025 and 65% by 2026 are fueling this narrative. This isn't just a bet on past performance; it's a forward-looking wager on a company they believe is just getting started. In the crowded tech landscape, SoundHound stands out as a pure-play voice AI company. Investors hungry for direct exposure to the AI theme have few alternatives, creating a scarcity premium that drives up its valuation. SoundHound offers a concentrated bet on a market that's just beginning to unlock its full potential. The recent acquisition of Amelia has allowed SoundHound to enter the lucrative enterprise generative AI market, a much larger playing field. This strategic move has fundamentally reshaped how investors perceive the company, justifying the higher multiples in their minds. The valuation expansion reflects a deep-seated optimism about SoundHound's future in this fast-growing sector. Finally, SoundHound's valuation is also a product of market momentum and speculation. The stock's extreme volatility has drawn in capital from traders and short-term investors, amplifying its moves during broader AI sector rallies. These technical factors have a self-fulfilling effect, pushing the valuation multiple even higher. Beyond these factors, a crucial, often-overlooked driver of SoundHound's valuation is the value of its unique data. Every voice command processed in a car, every order taken at a drive-thru, and every customer service interaction adds to its proprietary dataset. This data is the lifeblood of its AI models, making them smarter and more effective than a rival's. As the dataset grows, it creates a powerful network effect and a competitive moat. This is why major companies are signing long-term deals—they aren't just buying a service; they're contributing to and benefiting from an ever-improving AI. On a separate note, check out our take on – At $25 Is Pfizer Stock Deep Value Or A Falling Knife? At its current price of around $13, SoundHound's stock is trading at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 37.6x, still below its two-year average of 48.7x. However, while the valuation multiple will likely compress to more reasonable levels, the strong growth in revenues will more than offset that, resulting in higher levels for SOUN stock. See, Voice AI is not just a feature for SoundHound; it's a transformative technology poised to revolutionize human-computer interaction across multiple industries. The company's strategic positioning in conversational AI is set to capitalize on a massive wave of digital transformation across its entire customer ecosystem. Voice AI is the new frontier for SoundHound AI, fueling a multi-industry revolution. The company is capitalizing on a massive digital transformation, solidifying its position as the go-to provider in the automotive sector through partnerships with giants like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. Beyond the car, its AI-powered conversational interfaces are transforming customer service in enterprise, while also unlocking new revenue streams in the restaurant and hospitality industries by enabling voice-activated ordering and reducing labor costs. This strategic expansion across multiple fronts is the engine behind its accelerating revenue growth. Despite its remarkable surge, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk bet with a history of sharp, punishing downturns. Its journey is a masterclass in both extreme volatility and resilience. When markets turn sour, SoundHound doesn't just dip—it plummets. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, SOUN stock fell a staggering 94%, a far steeper and more painful drop than the S&P 500's 25% decline. This history proves that the stock can fall harder and faster than its peers, leaving investors with little room to maneuver. More recently, the stock suffered another major blow when Nvidia exited its stake in early 2025, a powerful signal that contributed to its later volatility. Beyond market-wide shocks, SoundHound faces significant, company-specific vulnerabilities. The Profitability Paradox: Despite its impressive revenue growth, SoundHound continues to burn through cash with persistent losses. A Crisis of Credibility: The company is grappling with allegations of misleading financial reporting and inflated goodwill. These accusations have created a credibility gap that increases risk for institutional investors and injects a new layer of volatility into the stock. The Valuation Disconnect: At a price-to-sales multiple of 38, SoundHound's stock is trading at lofty levels that may not reflect its underlying fundamentals. Without a clear timeline to profitability, a disconnect exists between its sky-high valuation and its financial reality. This makes it vulnerable to a sudden and significant correction. For a deeper dive into the specific risks that could trigger a severe downturn, we've outlined a full downside scenario in our separate analysis, SoundHound AI: The Downside Case. Despite its potential, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk, high-reward investment. While near-term volatility will likely continue, the company's strong position in the fast-growing voice AI market, combined with its accelerating revenue and expanding partnerships, presents a compelling case for significant upside over the next two to three years. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks, including a lofty valuation, intense competition, and a history of extreme volatility during market downturns, which could severely impact returns. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Strengthening the sustainability of neglected tropical disease programs in Rwanda: An assessment of access and utilization of domestically-financed services for soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371
Time Published: 2025-08-29T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH) infections remain some of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity in most of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Rwanda. With dwindling international funding for NTD services and recent commitments focused on other diseases considered easier to eliminate as a public health problem, it is essential to assess domestic financing sources’ scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. The study aims to strengthen domestic efforts towards sustainable financing for neglected tropical disease programs in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Up to 235 patients from 24 health centers in four districts of Rwanda were sampled for this survey. The districts selected had the highest number of STH and SCH based on routine data from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. We estimated affordability using the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and then compared this with household income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. Data was collected from August to September 2023. Limited secondary data were collected to complement primary data. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to present the findings. The most available drugs were mebendazole, with 100% of facilities reporting no stockout. Praziquantel (PZQ) was the most unavailable drug, reporting 92% stockout at the time of the survey, mainly due to delays in getting supplies from MDA-implementing health facilities. Diagnostics for SCH are the most inaccessible lab services. On average, the total cost (both direct and opportunity cost) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was USD 0.72 (RWF 861.92) and USD 0.96 (RWF 1136.41) for male and female patients, respectively. Although the assessment revealed that treatment for STH and SCH was affordable for the LPGW, women pay a 33% higher cost than men to access NTD services. While services are generally satisfactory, the reimbursement processes are slow, hindering timely access and utilization of SCH and STH services at the health facilities in Rwanda. While the access and utilization of STH and SCH services in health centers are generally promising, the findings underscore the potential for improvement. By addressing the efficiency in the supply of praziquantel drugs and enhancing reimbursement timelines, we can ensure the continuity and effectiveness of these services, offering hope for a brighter future in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms. Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets. Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Health systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) pose significant barriers to the population’s access to health services. There are infrastructural gaps, particularly in rural areas, which experience geographical barriers to health facilities, poor medical supplies, and weak digital health infrastructure [1]. Human resource shortages, urban-biased distribution, and governance challenges continue to pose essential access barriers [2]. Apart from these, perhaps the most significant challenge remains financing, where many countries on the continent are far from meeting their health financing goals, e.g., less than seven countries met the Abuja target, and many countries’ out-of-pocket payments remain unacceptably high with low domestic spending and continued reliance on external resources [3]. With increasing anxiety over the long-term financing from external sources exemplified by the exit of USAID and sustainability challenges, one program area of concern is the financing of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are diverse communicable yet preventable parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that affect over 1.0 billion of the world’s poorest and vulnerable populations primarily in tropical and sub‐tropical settings in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4–6]. Up to 40% of the affected populations live in Africa, with the poorest and most vulnerable residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas [7–9]. Among the most prevalent NTDs, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), or intestinal worms, remain a global public health concern and are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. They primarily affect poor communities with no access to potable water [10]. It is estimated that about 251.4 million people globally required preventive treatment for SCH in 2021, of which 93% of the total burden is found in sub-Saharan Africa [11]. Despite the existence of treatment and preventive measures, NTDs continue to be responsible for many years of life lost due to disability and premature death among the poor [12]. NTDs, therefore, constitute a disproportionate health burden to marginalized populations and exacerbate inequity. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3) seek to close the health equity gap and have highlighted NTDs as necessary in achieving this objective. Improving access to NTD services is paramount to the SDGs agenda of reducing disease burden and improving health outcomes for all. Among children, NTDs contribute to disabilities and cognitive impairment, limiting their ability to progress with education and improve their living standards in adulthood [13]. Among adults, NTDs limit productivity and directly impact economic development [14]. Factors that exacerbate the NTD burden include poverty and marginalization, underfunding for health systems, and poor surveillance data [15,16]. The endemicity, the burden, and poor financing of NTDs in Africa are well documented [6,13,16–21]. Rwanda is considered one of the best-performing countries in Africa in its efforts to improve access to health services through public health insurance schemes and increased government spending on healthcare. For example, while Rwanda’s current health expenditure as a share of GDP stands at about 7.2%, its neighbours such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania average 3% of GDP as of 2020 [22] However, the country remains endemic for two of the five NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC) [23]. National prevalence of SCH ranged between 0% and 70% in areas surrounding water bodies in 2008, and the prevalence has declined significantly over the years, according to recent assessment reports [23,24]. In 2020, data yet to be published by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) showed that the threshold for elimination as a public health problem was reached in 97% of high-risk villages selected to assess the impact. In contrast, the national prevalence of STH infections stood at 41% as of 2020 [7,23,25]. However, the 2020 impact assessment found that adults remain the most infected compared to school-aged children, i.e., 48% versus 41%. In light of diminishing international support for NTD programs [26], and to maintain the gains in the fight against NTDs and increase service coverage for all, there is greater emphasis on domestic financing for sustainability. Currently, financing STH, SCH, and other related NTDs in Rwanda heavily depends on external sources. From the approved budgets, the funding for STH and SCH was RWF 6,250.59 million (USD 6.16 million) in the financial year 2021/22 and RWF 9048.54 million (USD 8.46 million) in 2022/23. External sources accounted for almost 92% of overall STH and SCH spending RWF 14,032.71 (USD 13.47 million) in the FYs 2021/22 and 2022/23. However, the government contribution significantly increased from RWF 126.33 (USD 0.12) million in 2021/22 to RWF 1100.388 (USD 1.07) million in 2022/23. Despite the increase in government budget, external funding remains significant and could grossly affect NTD service delivery if abruptly cut. To reduce dependency on external funding for NTDs, the government aims to increase budget allocation to account for at least 40% of the NTD budget to ensure sustainability [27]. Alongside budget increases, the Rwandan Government has improved access to NTD services by rolling out bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA), ensuring that over 65 million treatments against intestinal worms and schistosomiasis were delivered to children aged 1–15 years since 2008 [28]. The government has taken further steps to improve access to NTD treatment and preventive services by progressively integrating NTDs into the national health insurance benefit package- the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme. Rwanda’s CBHI scheme was initiated by the Rwandan Government in 2005 to spread the financial burden of medical costs and ensure that the poor and vulnerable households have access to essential health services without incurring a financial burden [29]. The government subsidizes the CBHI scheme at almost 50% of the total funding [29–31]. The benefits package includes comprehensive preventive and curative services and essential drugs at health centers and referral hospitals. Integrating NTDs into the routine health services delivery system is a crucial indicator for domestic financing and is considered a key step toward sustainable NTD programming in endemic countries [32]. While the efforts to eliminate NTDs through sustainable financing in Rwanda are commendable, there are empirical gaps on whether the current funding from domestic sources (government and public insurance) has improved NTD service availability, affordability, and optimized utilization by the population to contribute toward sustainable elimination. For instance, STH and SCH services are expected to be available and affordable to all those in need of the services, but the range of services covered, their availability, demand, and utilization, and who bears the cost burden in trying to access SCH and STH services, is not well-understood in Rwanda. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide evidence on the implications of public financing of NTDs on service access. This will assist the government and the CBHI in improving domestic resource mobilization and allocation for effective and sustainable NTD elimination. A protocol was submitted to the Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Rwanda National Research Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). Approval for the study was received from RNEC (RNEC-IRB 0001497 of I0RGOOO1100) on August 11, 2023—collaboration letter from the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), Ref. No M84/RBC/2023, provided a human subjects exemption for this research on 13 October 2023. The study relied mainly on primary survey data collected through exit interviews. Secondary data were collected to inform the NTD financing situation in Rwanda and to understand the government budget for operational costs related to mass drug administration (MDA). This study was conducted in 24 randomly selected health centers in four Rwanda districts: Gisagara, Rubavu, Burera, and Rutsiro. These are amongst the districts with the co-endemicity for STH and Schistosomiasis as reported in the Rwanda NTDs Strategic Plan 2019–2024 [24]. In addition, these districts had a high number of STH and SCH, all combined from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. All the selected health centers were providing STH and SCH services (deworming medications including albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel; diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (SCH) and STH or intestinal worms) covered by the CBHI scheme. The sample size was calculated using the SCH and STH facility visits data for 2022, which was estimated at 207,572 visits. Assuming each of the 24 facilities had an equal number of visits during the year 2022, each facility received about 8649 SCH and STH patients, which translates to about 24 visits per day in each facility. Aiming for a higher sample size, the study chose to interview 50% of the census sample, i.e., every second patient in each facility was interviewed, which gave a total sample size of 288 SCH and STH patients. 235 patients were accepted to participate in the study, with an acceptable response rate of about 82%. In addition, 24 facility in-charges from the 24 health facilities were interviewed to assess stock levels of SCH and STH drugs. A total of four data collectors were assigned responsibility for collecting data at each of the 24 facilities. Each two-person team split responsibility between collecting facility data of individual facilities and interviewing individual study participants to assess the availability, affordability, and utilization of STH and SCH services. Data collection was completed between August and September 2023. Exit interview participants were recruited from the 24 facilities among the target populations in need of STH and SCH services who came to a study site seeking these services. Individual participants were selected after they had received STH and SCH services at the respective facility. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant, using an approved recruitment script, and all respondents were asked if they were willing to voluntarily participate in the study. All willing participants signed a consent form after acknowledging their understanding of the purpose of the study. Exit interviews were conducted with each eligible participant based on their willingness to participate. The information collected included demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, religion, membership in a health insurance scheme, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status), transport costs, amount paid for drugs, travel time to and from the facility, and waiting time. English and Kinyarwanda translations of the participant and facility questionnaires were loaded onto a mobile data collection application, KoBoCollect, which was used to record responses. In this study, we considered three key dimensions of access [33] which include: (i) availability of services (drugs and non-drug pharmaceuticals, physical accessibility including distance to facility and travel time, and availability of qualified staff (ii) affordability of services including cost of medicine, travel costs, cost of consultation incurred concerning tests/investigations, other indirect costs); (iii) acceptability of services such as social and cultural context (gender) affecting accessibility, and individual patient perceptions of quality of services. Accessibility was assessed using the WHO availability target of greater than or equal to 80%. Affordability was estimated based on the average monthly wage for the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW). From an economic costing perspective, affordability was also estimated using direct financial expenses and opportunity costs. Costs to STH and SCH patients are largely restricted to the charges for the transport costs incurred from home to the treatment site and opportunity costs. The out-of-pocket costs included round-trip transportation costs, which were assessed through the exit interviews, and the time required for obtaining treatment, which included the round-trip travel time to the facility, waiting time, and time for consultation until exit from the facility. The patient’s daily earnings give an estimate of the value of time spent at the health facility. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Simple descriptive statistics assessed the availability, affordability, and utilization/demand of the selected STH and SCH drugs and related services. An availability of 80% or higher was used as the benchmark for accessibility as per WHO guidelines [34]. The combined availability of commodities that were surveyed was calculated to provide the overall availability of that specific commodity at the facility. Stockout information was sought from all the selected STH and SCH commodities covered by the CBHI scheme, which were supposed to be available at that level of care, regardless of whether they were in or out of stock at the time of the survey. Stockout was calculated as the percentage of facilities that reported at least one stockout of the selected STH and SCH commodity over the measured period, with stockout days calculated as the average number of days stockouts of a commodity lasted per facility. To calculate affordability, the median price of the entire treatment course of a commodity was compared to the official salary of the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW), per day in 2023. If a commodity price exceeded one day’s wages, it would be considered unaffordable based on the World Bank’s international poverty line (IPL) of USD 2.15 per person per day. Accessibility was calculated using the availability and LPGW affordability measures. This resulted in a composite measure in which accessibility is achieved with an 80% or higher availability and a price of less than a day’s wage for an LPGW. The results were then compared with information on income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. The results, presented in Table 1, revealed that the respondents tended to be young, with 39.2% under 30 years old. About the same number of respondents were single and never married (28%) or were living together (28.1%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t001 As depicted in Fig 1, almost all the patients (99%) received consultation services, 29.8% received SCH diagnostic services, and 85% received STH diagnostics. A third of the respondents (33%) received the prescribed albendazole medicine, and 66.8% and 12.8% received the prescribed mebendazole and praziquantel medicines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g001 Regarding stockouts of STH and SCH drugs on the day of the survey (Fig 2), 22 (92%) out of the 24 facilities did not have praziquantel drugs, and 11 (46%) had no diagnostics for STH or intestinal worms. In comparison, diagnostics for schistosomiasis were unavailable in 14 (58%) of the facilities. However, mebendazole drugs were available in all 24 health facilities. Note that, as the primary strategy for the NTD elimination programs, preventive chemotherapy (PC) employs anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ADZ) or mebendazole (MBDZ) for STHs, ADZ and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and/or ivermectin (IVM) for LF and onchocerciasis, and praziquantel (PZQT) for SCH [35]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g002 The stockout of STH/SCH drugs forced patients to either use an alternative drug, e.g., mebendazole in place of albendazole, or to visit the facility another day when supplies were available. Alternatively, those who could afford it were advised by health workers to purchase at private facilities. As noted by the study, one of the major contributors to drug stockouts is a delay in receiving reimbursements for services provided. At the time of the survey, 23 out of the 24 facilities in the sample indicated that they experienced delays in receiving reimbursements from the CBHI through the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) for services provided during FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23. Table 2 presents the estimated number of months of delays in receiving the funds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t002 About 75% of the facilities experienced 2–4 months of delays. The respondents cited several causes for the delays, including errors in preparing the invoice (37.5%), delays in submitting the invoice by the facilities (45.8%), delayed reimbursement from the CBHI scheme (79.2%), and delays in verifying the invoices (20.8%). The delayed reimbursement does not affect SCH and STH services alone, but the availability of all services is affected since health facilities cannot replenish their entire stocks before funds are made available. The study also considered the time taken to receive services (travel and waiting time) as a measure of availability in the timely use of NTD services. On average, women spent more time than men receiving NTD services (307.4 minutes or 5.0 hours for women compared to 238.5 minutes or 4.0 hours for men). In travel time, women spent about 95.93 minutes (approximately 2 hours) traveling to health facilities versus 78.94 minutes (approximately 1.3 hours) spent by men. Similarly, average time spent with the clinician, average waiting time, and average time after consultation to exit the facility were approximately 159.6 minutes (approximately 2.6 hours) for male patients and 211.5 minutes (3.5 hours) for female patients (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t003 There was no immediate explanation for the differences between men and women in the time taken to receive services. However, less travel time and higher transport costs for men compared to women indicate that more men than women used motorbikes or other faster and more expensive means of transportation to the health facility. This suggests an economic advantage for men in accessing health facilities. A summary of patients’ indirect costs (cost of travel and waiting time), direct costs, and total costs for accessing STH and SCH treatment is presented in Table 4. The average total cost (including both direct and opportunity costs) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was US$0.72 (RWF 834.08) and US$0.96 (RWF 1,112.11) for male and female respondents, respectively. The average total cost for the opportunity costs accounted for 1.5% (US$0.45 or RWF 521.30) of the total average cost per day for male respondents. In comparison, the opportunity cost for female respondents accounted for 2.4% (US$0.68 or RWF 787.75) of the total cost per day. The out-of-pocket costs for transportation fares amounted to $0.09 (RWF 104.26) and $0.06 (RWF 69.51) for male and female respondents, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t004 The findings indicate that the average daily income was highest among male respondents at RWF1,784.01 (US$1.54) against RWF 1,702.92 (US$1.47) for females. The results show disparity in the costs for male and female respondents, which is largely driven by the amount of travel time and, hence, the cost per round trip. Table 5 presents the total average cost of time for the daily visits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t005 The total cost to patients accessing STH and SCH services for a month was compared with the average monthly household income (Table 5). The results show that male patients paid direct costs of nearly US$0.28 (about 0.95% of average household income per month) for a month (assuming one visit to the health facility per month) to access treatment services at the facilities. The share of direct costs paid by female patients was US$0.28, which is about 0.99% of the average household income per month of US$28.30. The direct costs combined with indirect costs produced a total mean cost burden of US$0.72 or 3.4% of household income per month for male patients and a mean total cost per month of US$0.96 or 2.5% of average monthly household income for female patients (Fig 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g003 The total direct and indirect costs as a share of household income are presented in Table 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t006 The results show that the poorest households spent about 3.3% of their income on STH and SCH care. On the other hand, those in the middle—and upper-income brackets spent between 1.7% and 2.5% of their income on STH and SCH care and treatment. The wealthiest households with an income of RWF 250,000 spent 4.7% on STH and SCH treatment and care. These findings, including on the expenditures of LPGW, show no real financial risk involving catastrophic payments for STH and SCH services. These findings show that the cost burden of SCH and STH services is progressive because of government subsidies that target low-income earners. Higher income brackets are also likely to spend more on faster means of transportation and also pay out of pocket during stockouts. Costs by district show Rubavu District is the most expensive for those seeking SCH and STH services. Women incur the highest cost averaging about USD 1.37 against men who incur USD 0.83 per trip (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t007 In addition to cost, the quality of services is an important determinant of using STH and SCH services. In this study, respondents were asked to record their level of satisfaction concerning: (i) quality of treatment received, ii) privacy and confidentiality, iii) timeliness in the provision of services, (iv) facility cleanliness and hygiene, (v) attitude towards patients, (vi) overall rating. A rating scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor) was used. Most respondents (78.3%) rated the services provided as good, while 17.5% rated them as fair and 1.7% rated the services as poor. Other aspects of acceptability (e.g., cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment and waiting time, and staff attitude) were similar, indicating that an overwhelming majority of the respondents viewed the services as acceptable (Table 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t008 In addition, the study assessed the availability of treatment protocols as a measure of improved patient-centered outcomes. The survey results revealed that 21 (88%) of the facilities did not have NTD treatment protocols for various NTDs, and only three facilities reported availability of treatment protocols for NTDs. The utilization of STH and SCH services decreased slightly from 215,267 OPD visits in 2021–207,572 OPD visits in 2022 (Table 9). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t009 The data show that most STH and SCH patients were treated asymptomatically. Patients receiving intestinal worm medications (mebendazole or albendazole) accounted for 82.3% of the total outpatient (OPD) visits over the two years. In contrast, diagnostics accounted for 17.3% of the visits for STH and 4% for SCH. In terms of utilization by district, the health facilities in Burera district accounted for 29.1% and 29.7%, respectively, of the total utilization of STH and SCH services, followed by Rubavu, which accounted for 26.7% and 26.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Facilities in the Gisagara district reported the lowest utilization, at 17.7% in 2021 and 18.8% in 2022 (Table 10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t010 The number of OPD visits for all STH and SCH services during the two years declined slightly, except for intestinal worm medication. The largest drop in outpatient utilization (OPD) was observed in the diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (from 1732 OPD visits in 2021–136 OPD visits in 2022), followed by patients for deworming medications (mebendazole), whose utilization declined from 79,233 in 2021–70,826. There are concerns about access and sustainability of health services in general and NTD programs in particular due to overreliance on external funding and low domestic investments. Sustainability means the capacity of a health system to maintain the gains toward NTD prevention and control on the path to elimination. Poor access to NTD services has broader policy implications beyond the health system. It imposes an economic burden by reducing productivity and contributes to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion [36]. Late-stage presentations of most NTDs are not just fatal but are a significant burden to health facilities and jeopardize progress toward Universal Health Coverage. The United Nations SDGs recognize universal access to NTD services as integral to achieving UHC [37]. On the other hand, children afflicted with NTDs have lower educational achievement as NTDs increase absenteeism and cognitive impairment, therefore potentially contributing to lower social status [13,38]. As a largely neglected program in many low- and middle-income countries, countries are encouraged to invest domestic resources to control and eliminate NTDs. In Rwanda, the bulk (90%) of funding for STH and SCH prevention and elimination is external. However, the Rwanda Government has progressively relied less on external support to control and eliminate NTDs. The steps include (i) the introduction of a budget line for procurement of NTD drugs, (ii) the design and delivery of a package of NTD care under the CBHI scheme, (iii) the adoption of one health policy that commits to enhance collaboration of different actors of NTD stakeholders, (iv) budget allocation for MDA operational costs, and (v) decentralization of NTD interventions and integration of NTD prevention efforts to the village level under district coordination. The study focused on understanding how public domestic financing through the Rwandan government’s introduction of a budget line for NTD drugs and financing under the CBHI scheme has influenced access to and utilization of SCH and STH services in Rwanda. The introduction of a budget vote influences access to healthcare by guaranteeing a resource basket, affecting the funding available for health services [39]. In so doing, it contributes to financial risk protection by lowering the cost of care for individuals. There is a growing body of literature on NTD service access (availability, affordability, and utilization) with mixed results [16,40–42]; e.g., in Ethiopia, Kassahun et al. [40] showed that service availability is relatively good with up to 64% of all health facilities offering STH services, but only 40% had SCH services. Our findings show a similar trajectory of inconsistency in the availability of SCH and STH drugs; e.g., praziquantel is the least available medicine with a stockout rate of 92% because of delays in receiving supplies from MDA implementing health facilities. This is followed by albendazole, received by just 33% of patients seeking care. On the other hand, mebendazole was the most available drug with 100% facilities stocked. In other NTDs, Ooms et al. [41] report low availability of snakebite commodities (43%) in public health facilities. Similarly, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute [43] found that the availability of drugs for NTD treatment varied by facility type, with hospitals more likely than lower-level facilities to be stocked. One of the most cited causes of stockouts of essential drugs is delayed reimbursements to health facilities to allow for timely re-stocking of commodities [44,45]. The consequences of a lack of availability of essential NTD services are not only costly to those seeking care but also discourage repeat visits, which constitutes a barrier to NTD control and elimination. The reimbursements to facilities need to be predictable and the supply chain strengthened, to ensure consistency in the availability of critical NTD services, particularly those prepaid through publicly financed institutions. The availability of SCH and STH services is hampered by distance to health facilities, with women disproportionately affected. Of the 85% of the respondents who walked to a health facility, women spent on average 96 minutes compared to 79 minutes spent by men. The extra time spent by women traveling to health facilities not only has cost implications but also constitutes a physical barrier to accessing NTD services. Although the government took steps to reduce walking time to facilities by 50% (from 95 minutes to 47 minutes) in 2020 [46], the evidence suggests that there are still significant challenges in accessing health facilities in some districts. The steps taken by the government include the construction of health posts and the deployment of community health workers to bring services closer to communities [46]. The use of CHWs to bring NTD services closer to the communities has been proven effective in malaria control and improving maternal and child health services [47,48]. It is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control and elimination of NTDs. What remains encouraging in Rwanda is that SCH and STH services remain essentially affordable with no evidence of catastrophic expenses. Usually, out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered catastrophic and impoverishing when a household is forced to cut down on subsistence needs, sell productive assets, incur debts, or utilize savings to meet health needs [34,41,49,50]. Similar to this study, Dong et. al. [51] reported better affordability overall but also noted a large gap between the affordability levels of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) of essential drugs in Ethiopia. The affordability of SCH and STH services in Rwanda was primarily influenced by travel and waiting time, whose costs were higher than the expenses for the actual NTD services at health facilities. Noting that the indirect medical expenses disproportionately affected women calls for considering the driving factors in the analysis of access to NTD services in a low-resource setting, such as Rwanda. Women spent about a dollar more than men to access health facilities- a cost mainly attributed to more extended travel and waiting time, which are likely to be an important determinant of STH and SCH services utilization. Saxena et al. [52] have reported cost-related disparities between men and women in access to healthcare. Affordability is a critical determinant of access to health services in most settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Generally, essential health services are found to be relatively unaffordable to many people [16,42,49,53–55]. However, treatment costs for STH and SCH services are affordable in a low-income setting, requiring only 13% of a day’s wages from the LPGW. This suggests that NTD control and prevention is one of the best buys in public health available to those affected community members. Studies such as Ooms et. al. [40] have also demonstrated the affordability of NTD services, excluding snake anti-venoms, which are found to be unaffordable to most households in Kenya. Governments should, therefore, be encouraged to invest more in NTD control and elimination as a less costly alternative to the continued neglect of NTDs. Rwanda currently funds operational costs of MDAs, which indicates that significant costs can be domestically resourced when appropriately prioritized through political commitment, effective advocacy, governance, multisectoral coordination structures, and integration within the broader health system budgeting and planning processes. Evidence of steady demand and utilization of STH and SCH services in Rwanda indicates efficiency in the use of investments in NTDs, wherein the target population utilizes the services purchased; i.e., the population’s NTD needs are well aligned with the services purchased. There is also a clear linkage between service use and the reported high patient satisfaction with the services offered. However, the demand and utilization can still be improved with timely reimbursements to health facilities and a strengthened procurement and supply chain for NTD commodities. Satisfaction with health services is a contentious issue, especially in LMIC, with many reporting poor services associated mainly with poor staff attitude, ineffective physician consultations, and inefficient admission process [52,53]. However, in Ghana, there was an overwhelming majority (>95%) of patients who had a positive perception of the quality of services [19]. Our study reported 95.3% satisfaction with SCH and STH services, which means that, although the quality of services is generally low in low-resource settings, there is evidence from both the Ghanaian and Rwandan experiences that this can change for the better. The WHO emphasizes that the goals of UHC cannot be effectively achieved if the quality of services is not satisfactory. The surest way to sustain and eliminate neglected diseases is to combine adequate domestic financing with improved access to and utilization of quality NTD services. This combination needs to be approached from an equity lens, considering the identified gender gaps in access to SCH and STH services. The study is aware of biases related to self-reported data and ensured that the data collected from individual participants were triangulated with discussions with health workers. Micro-level gaps, such as socioeconomic indicators and behavioral determinants of health, were either not relevant to the objective of the study or addressed by having well-trained interviewers to ensure data consistency. The generalizability concerns have been addressed through triangulated data sources and a non-biased sampling process of 24 primary health facilities in different districts representing urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. However, the study acknowledges that the small sample size focusing on primary health facilities may limit generalization in hospital settings. We sincerely appreciate all the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey. We are also grateful to the senior staff at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) and the Ministry of Health for their kind support during the entire data collection period. We also thank the facility in-charges for their cooperation during this study.

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity. The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams. In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75. The company’s mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry’s most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels. Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million. On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs. With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit. The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year. Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand. "We've now shipped $10 billion of AI solutions in the first half of FY26, surpassing all shipments in FY25. This helped deliver another record revenue quarter in our Servers and Networking business, which grew 69%," COO Jeff Clarke said. "Demand for our AI solutions continues to be exceptional, and we're raising our AI server shipment guidance for FY26 to $20 billion" from $15 billion-plus. Citi analysts said in a note Friday that Dell's Q2 PC segment sales were below consensus forecasts "by 3% or roughly $357.0 million," and that it "likely lost share in PCs." It added that the increase in its AI server shipment guidance is good news for Nvidia (NVDA), which makes up 88% of its sales, and Micron Technology (MU), at 17%. "Dell expects the traditional server business to grow in the 2nd half but below their prior expectations from the beginning of the year," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Is Washington Trying to Build a Coalition of the Willing Against Venezuela?

Second question: does the “supposed” Cartel de los Soles actually exist? Before we get to the meat of this article, which is really two articles in one, a quick recap (just in case some readers have been on a news-fast for the past three weeks). A few months ago, the US government designated the “SUPPOSED” (more on that later) “Cartel de los Soles” as a terrorist organisation, of which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is its alleged leader — alleged as in according to the US government. In early August, the Trump Administration offered a $50 million reward, up from $25 million, for information leading to the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, accusing Venezuela of being a “narco state.” Shortly thereafter, the US announced the deployment of a missile cruiser, a submarine, and three amphibious ships carrying 4,500 troops to the Caribbean, under the pretext of intercepting drug trafficking networks. There is no open talk of regime change though that is clearly the goal, as we noted in our post last Friday on the real reasons behind Washington’s latest show of force against Venezuela: Anyone who believes or supports this latest pretext for war against a country the US has tried to regime change at least twice so far this century and which has been subject to more than a decade of crippling US sanctions is either exceptionally gullible or an apologist for empire. The most important reason, of course, is oil. As the Mexican-Lebanese geopolitical analyst Alfredo Jalife says, Venezuela, once the “ranchito” of the Rockefeller family, is written with a capital “P” for “petroleo”. Indeed, even as Trump has ratcheted tensions with Venezuela, Chevron is still pumping out Venezuelan oil and shipping it back to the US. Other possible reasons include Venezuela’s close ties to China, Russia and Iran, the US’ three most important strategic rivals. As we noted in that post, the build-up of troops could also be part of a diversionary tactic as the Trump administration continues to reel from the Epstein scandal. This being Trump, it could also be just pure bluff or bluster. But it could also be the beginnings of something far more serious: another US-led military disaster. In recent days, the Venezuelan government has mobilised no fewer than four million army reservists to defend “la patria“. Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced plans to reinforce the country’s anti-narcotics efforts through the deployment of military vessels and 15,000 troops to patrol the country’s “territorial waters.” President Maduro said on Monday that all branches of Venezuela’s armed forces were prepared to defend the country. Thousands of civilians joined a voluntary militia enrolment drive in public squares over the past weekend. At the international level, Venezuela’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations called on member states to demand an end to the US’ “hostile actions”. Some countries in the region, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, have expressed alarm about the US’ deployment of so much naval hardware so close to Venezuelan waters. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. The 11 member nations of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA-TCP) unanimously condemned the US threat to regional stability. However, other governments in the region have sided with Washington and even offered up their land and waters for US troop movements. France Joins the Ruckus France has decided to join the ruckus by sending more ships to Guadeloupe, its overseas territory in the Caribbean. The Macron government claims its naval reinforcements are part of an international cooperation effort to regime change Venezuela against criminal networks in the area, and stressed the need to protect its overseas territories, in particular Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are often used as transit points for drug trafficking to Europe. The move comes, ironically, as fears of a French government collapse send its borrowing costs soaring. In fact, one thing that all three of Europe’s largest economies, Germany, the UK and France, have in common is their growing financial pains. Both France and the UK now have higher yields on their ten-year bonds than Spain and Greece, and their is even talk in both countries of the possible need for an IMF bailout. Meanwhile Germany’s Chancellor (and former BlackRock board member) Friedrich Merz has warned that Germany’s welfare state model is no longer sustainable. As Yves would say, quelle surprise! Something else that unites the three countries is their governments’ determination to expand their military spending, at US insistence, despite their rapidly deteriorating finances. While French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou plans to freeze welfare payments, reduce pensioners’ benefits and abolish two national holidays, the one area where spending will dramatically increase is the military. As the French government deplores the state of its finances at home, it is sending military vessels to the Caribbean to join the US’ latest act of imperial misadventure. Which invites the question: will other US client and vassal states in Europe and Latin America be doing the same in the coming days and weeks? Is the US trying to build a “coalition of the willing” against Venezuela, just as it did against Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya with such disastrous consequences? There are certainly moves in that direction. Trinidad and Tobago’s recently elected right-leaning government last week expressed its support for the US naval operation, noting that organized crime and drug trafficking pose a direct threat to the security of the entire Caribbean. Desperate to court favours in Washington, the government also offered up its waters and territory for US operations against Venezuela if Washington requests them — to defend neighbouring Guyana, of course. The Essequibo Border Dispute For its part, the Guyanese government has also called for the strengthening of cooperation against transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism, in direct reference to the criminal organisation Cartel of the Suns. The President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, said last Saturday that his country is willing to take actions to defend its territory and sovereignty in the “new environment”. This is a reference to the escalating border dispute between Guyana (formerly British Guyana) and Venezuela over the Essequibo, a 160,000 square-kilometre oil-soaked territory that is on track to become Exxon Mobil’s largest single source of revenue by the end of this decade and which the US, unsurprisingly, would like to turn into a military outpost. For Guyana, the huge oil discoveries could end up being as much as curse as a blessing, as the NYT reported last year: The deal that made [Exxon’s success] ´possible — and which gave Exxon Mobil the bulk of the proceeds — has been a point of public outcry and even a lawsuit, with a seeming consensus that Guyana got the short end of the stick. But the deal has nonetheless generated $3.5 billion so far for the country, more money than it has ever seen, significantly more than it gained from conserving trees. It’s enough to chart a new destiny. But that new destiny has already included escalating tensions with its much larger neighbour, Venezuela, and risks turning Guyana into another disposable pawn in the furtherance of US geostrategic interests in its direct neighbourhood. As we warned in November 2023, this centuries-old dispute in an oil-rich corner of South America has the potential to become the next geopolitical flashpoint: Essequibo is not only rich in oil and gas; it boasts other mineral deposits, including Gold and Bauxite, as well as huge fish stocks and fresh water supplies, which a government minister even recently talked about exporting to other countries. As the Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), General Laura Richardson, said in January, Latin America is home to 31% of the world’s fresh water. But for the moment, it is Guyana’s vast untapped energy supplies that are of prime interest to US and global corporations. According to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, Guyana’s coastal area has roughly 13.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and 32 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves waiting to be drilled. For a country with one of the lowest population densities on the planet and a GDP of slightly less than $10 billion, a bonanza awaits. But Caracas contends that the untapped energy supplies belong to Venezuela and that the arbitration panel that granted Guyana jurisdiction over Essequibo was rigged. A Meagre Coalition So Far So far, four countries in the region have designated the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organisation: the United States, Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina. My guess is that Peru will be next in line. Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has already said that she has “not the slightest doubt” that Peru, like other countries in the region, will join this latest US-led charge against the Maduro government. However, as coalitions go, this one is pretty meagre. One country that is missing is Colombia, which has played a key role in previous regime change attempts, including Juan Guaidó’s risible coup attempt in 2019. However, since the election of left-leaning Gustavo Petro as president in 2022, Colombia has tried to replace its alignment with the US with multilateral relations, even going so far as to join the BRICS’ New Development Bank and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. When Petro took the reins as president, diplomatic ties between Colombia and Venezuela were essentially on hold. Since then relations have gradually been re-established. In recent months Petro has even proposed building a confederation of nations with neighbouring countries (Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) based on the former Greater Colombia that existed between 1819 and 1931 and comprised the four aforementioned countries. It will be very interesting to see how Colombia responds to developments in Venezuela. A few days ago, Maduro announced the movement of 15,000 troops to Venezuela’s border with Colombia earlier this week. Then yesterday (Aug 28), Gustavo Petro announced the movement of 25,000 Colombian troops to the other side of that border, which has been greeted positively by the Maduro government. This border region has long been a focal point of violent clashes between government forces (on both sides), insurgency and paramilitary groups. Lest we forget, Colombia is trying to put behind it 52 years of civil war. However, political violence is once again rearing its ugly head. A few weeks ago, the opposition politician Miguel Uribe finally succumbed to the injuries he sustained in an assassination attempt in mid-June. In addition, a car bomb was recently set off next to a military base in Cali and a police helicopter downed in the town of Amalfi. In total, 19 people were killed and 65 injured in the two attacks. The car bomb explosion in Cali has been described by local media as the “worst terrorist attack” in the country since 2019, when ELN guerrillas staged a car bomb attack against the General Santander police school, in the south of Bogotá, leaving 21 dead. Both attacks were attributed to dissident factions of the now-extinct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. President Petro described what happened as “a day of death.” One can imagine Petro spending much of his time looking over his shoulder. Colombia is home to at least seven US military bases, and was until recently considered by many, including Hugo Chávez, as the Israel of Latin America. But Petro has tried to change that — first, by building alliances with other Global South countries, and second, by severing ties with Israel over its genocide in Gaza. In the process, he will have made lots of enemies, at home and abroad. In July, audio recordings were released in which Petro’s former Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva could be heard talking about organising a coup against the Petro government. Israel is also stirring the pot, as the veteran journalist Gonzalo Guillén warned in a tweet yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime and the far right in general are promoting an irresponsible and fallacious narrative: that Hezbollah terrorism is hiding on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. This claim, besides being completely unsubstsantiated and absurd, clearly aims to ignite the region and destabilise both countries. This accusation is entirely baseless and has serious geopolitical implications. They seek to generate chaos, confrontation, and destruction. Does the Cartel de los Soles Actually Exist? This is a question NC reader Veronius asked in a comment to our previous post on Venezuela. According to Gustavo Petro, the answer is a definitive “no”. “It is the fictitious excuse used by the far right to overthrow governments that do not obey them,” Petro wrote on X earlier this week. In so doing, he opened up an intriguing can of worms. According to US government agencies, there is more than sufficient evidence tying senior Venezuelan army commanders and senior members of the Maduro government to drug trafficking. But not everyone agrees. Even the former Venezuelan presidential candidate Enrique Capriles, who is certainly no friend of the Maduro government, has said in an interview with CNN (see below) that the US government needs to back up its claims with evidence. We, Venezuelans, don’t know who is part of the Cartel de los Soles. I don’t have any information on that. I can’t provide it and I think the United States needs to present the evidence. Such a serious accusation requires putting the proof on the table. Who are the members of the Cartel de los Soles? Who runs it, where does it operate? But not just in rhetoric, show the evidence. La extrema derecha venezolana desplegó una campaña de acoso y derribo contra Henrique Capriles porque pide algo de sentido común: mostrar las pruebas de ese supuesto Cartel de los Soles, quiénes operan y dónde. "De una acusación tan grave, hay que poner las pruebas sobre la mesa" https://t.co/NzSUUezGiA — Karen Méndez (@Karenmendezl) August 29, 2025 If the Cartel de los Soles does indeed exist, one thing is clear: it is not nearly as big a player in the global drugs trade as the Trump administration is making out — and certainly not as big a player as the US government itself. As we noted in our previous post, the US is arguably the largest enabler of drug trafficking organisations on the planet: [This it does] while waging a Global War on Drugs, just as it has been arguably the largest supporter of Islamist terrorist organisations while waging a Global War on Terror. Both types of organisations have proven to be useful allies in the pursuance of US imperial ambitions (e.g. the Colombian and Mexican cartels during Nicaragua’s Contra insurgency in the 1980s, or the Al Qaeda offshoots in Syria) while also serving as handy pretexts for military intervention. It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, doing something the US military never could, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. pic.twitter.com/LcAFqA317a — MintPress News (@MintPressNews) August 7, 2023 According to the official narrative, shaped over the past decade by US government agencies and Western media, the Cartel de los Soles is a loose-knit network of Venezuelan generals and politicians that are involved in drug trafficking, in alliance with Colombian and Mexican cartels. The organisation came into existence some time in the ’90s when army officials began taking kickbacks from Colombian cartels. The name “Cartel of Suns” allegedly comes from the emblems that looked like suns on the generals’ uniforms. To date, the US has prosecuted two Venezuelan generals on charges related to drug trafficking. In the most recent case, Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former head of military intelligence in Venezuela during Hugo Chávez’s government, last month pled guilty to trafficking cocaine to the US in a narcoterrorism conspiracy. As the journalist Antonio Maria Delgado reported in the Miami Herald, Carvajal also claims to have evidence about Venezuela’s involvement with Iran and Colombia’s FARC, espionage within the US, and Maduro’s ties with the Tren de Aragua gang, which serves as a “paramilitary arm of the state” and which has also been designated by the US as a terrorist organisation. However, Delgado notes, “Carvajal has a history of shifting loyalties and politically motivated statements”. Of course, the idea of army generals taking kickbacks from drug trafficking organisations is totally believable. It happens all over the world. Whether in Mexico, Afghanistan, Myanmar or Colombia, wherever large volumes of drugs are being cultivated, processed, or distributed, rest assured that some (often senior) army officers are getting a cut of the action for looking the other way, or even for helping with the distribution. A perfect case in point: “Tim told me about basically a gang … a drug-trafficking organization within the military,” made up of “an unspoken group of soldiers that policed themselves.” Inside Fort Bragg's Secret Cartel and Unsolved Murders: https://t.co/ZSgmHIFaZN https://t.co/Fqfqg9RZbq pic.twitter.com/HsspVifLCv — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) July 28, 2025 As Venezuela Analysis notes, reports from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) itself state that less than 10% of US-bound cocaine flowed through Venezuela and the Eastern Caribbean corridor: A 2020 document from the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) by Venezuelan government critics Geoff Ramsey and David Smilde concluded that the country “is not a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine” and that the bulk of drug shipments reach US territory via Washington-allied countries in Central America. In more recent years, Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine, with some reports suggesting that as much as 70% of the global cocaine supply passes through the country. Curiously, the Cartel de los Soles does not merit a single mention in the DEA’s National Drug Threat Assessment from last year. Nor is it mentioned in previous editions I’ve checked. Even in the 2025 edition, which was written under the Trump administration, “Cartel de los Soles” does not appear once. If the organisation is such a threat, why doesn’t it feature once in the DEA’s threat assessment? The European Drug Report 2025, based on real data and not on geopolitical interests, does not mention Venezuela once as an international drug trafficking route. Even more damning is an article by Pino Arlacci, the former Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime. Here is a brief excerpt, though the article is well worth reading in its entirety (if you don’t speak Spanish, use a machine translator): During my tenure as Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime, I was in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, but I never visited Venezuela. There was simply no need. The Venezuelan government’s cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking was one of the best in South America; it can be compared only to Cuba’s impeccable record. This fact, in Trump’s delusional narrative of “Venezuela as a narco-state,” sounds like a geopolitically motivated slander. But the data, published in the 2025 World Drug Report of the organization I had the honor of leading, tell an opposite story to the one spread by the Trump administration. A story that dismantles piece by piece the geopolitical framework built around the “Cartel of the Suns”, an entity as legendary as the Loch Ness Monster, but apt to justify sanctions, embargoes and threats of military intervention against a country that, coincidentally, is located on one of the largest oil reserves on the planet… The “Cartel of the Suns” is a creation of Trump’s imagination. It is supposedly led by the president of Venezuela, but it is not mentioned in the report of the world’s main anti-drug agency, nor in the documents of any European agency or almost any other anti-crime agency in the world. Not even a footnote. A deafening silence, which should make anyone who even has a minimum of critical thinking reflect. How can such a powerful criminal organization, deserving of a $50 million bounty, be completely ignored by those working in the anti-drug field?… While Washington is stirring up the issue of Venezuela, the real centers of drug trafficking prosper almost undisturbed. In Ecuador, for example, 57% of the containers of bananas that leave Guayaquil arrive in Belgium loaded with cocaine. European authorities seized 13 tons of cocaine from a Spanish ship coming from Ecuadorian ports, controlled by companies protected by Ecuadorian government officials. The European Union produced a detailed report on the ports of Guayaquil, which describes how “Colombian, Mexican and Albanian mafias operate extensively in Ecuador.” The homicide rate in this country has skyrocketed from 7.8 per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2020 to 45.7 in 2023. But little is said about it. Perhaps because Ecuador produces only 0.5% of the world’s oil and because its government does not have a bad habit of challenging US dominance in Latin America? Lastly, something else that caught my eye during my research for this article was Wikipedia’s Spanish-language page on the Cartel de los Soles. On Google Search, the blurb below the title, which should match the first line or two of text on the corresponding Wikipedia page, reads as follows, or at least did so yesterday (translation and emphasis my own): The Cartel de los Soles is a supposed criminal and terrorist organisation led, according to the President of the United States, by senior military officers… In other words, even Wikipedia was still expressing doubts about its existence until a couple of days ago, and the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by Venezuelan senior military officers is sourced directly from the US government. However, if you click on the link, here’s what you now see: Translation (emphasis my own): The Cartel of the Suns is an illicit, criminal, and terrorist organization headed by high-ranking members of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces since the 1990s, according to some media outlets,[1] whose objective is primarily cocaine trafficking,[2] fuel smuggling,[3][4] control of illegal mining activity in several states of Venezuela, with direct participation in the extraction and smuggling of gold, coltan, precious stones and other minerals. [5] In other words, not only has the qualifier “supposed” been edited out of the text, expelling all doubt from readers’ minds, but also the reference to the president of the United States as the primary source for the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by senior military commanders of Venezuela’s armed forces. In its place as the new source for this information is “some media outlets”. And just like that, with a couple of minor tweaks to the text, all doubt is removed from the reader’s unsuspecting mind. And that, it seems, is one way that consent for US military operations is manufactured in today’s digital world. ‘The coalition of the willing’ is to normalize the militarism of the west (just as ‘weaponize’ is lazy semantics for propaganda). There is not ‘coalition of the willing’, there is only a groups of far right militarist western governments that seek global domination. There is no ‘willing’ population for these wars (if there were, then where are the lines for military recruitment?) . Do not join in the marketing jingoism of the imperialists do attack them, it is important to deconstruct their language, to show that not only their arguments but the foundations of its construct are erroneous You raise a fair point, haradan, and it is one that I will certainly keep in mind for the future. Unfortunately, because the expression in question is in the title of the post, it’s too late to change it. No, using the term, “coalition of the willing” is a fun euphemism that recalls the US government’s manufacture of consent in the run up to the Iraq war. For anyone older than 30 who remembers that episode, it was a real demonstration of just how many countries’ governments can be called upon to support a war that’s cooked up from scratch. The power of the internet allows us to catalog elite crimes and their methods to engineer conflict. We know how they did it decades ago, and they’re following the same template. There maybe is not a coalition of the willing population, but there sure is a coalition of the willing governments. They are willing, and eager, though maybe lacking on the ‘able’. Has the CIA been messing with Wikipedia again? Nostalgia fans will remember when Reagan claimed he supported the Contras to keep Nicaragua from attacking our southern border. Before that Adolf kicked off WW2 in response to Polish aggression. As Jean Renoir says in Rules of the Game, “everybody has their reasons.” Still if regime change in Venezuela is in the cards who will do the invading? Unlike Kissinger’s Chile coup the army there seems to be on Maduro’s side. Perhaps it’s all simply a plan to give General Laura and her minions something to do. In a recent Nima talk Richard Wolff suggests that ever since the Great Depression the US economy has run on military Keynsianism. Are Macron and the Euros out to do the same? Somebody hold him back. Perhaps the whole point of this operation was a sort of litmus test while Trump is trying to make himself appear tough in front of his base. It is to gauge how much support there would be for a future move on Venezuela. Thing is, by the time one is organized France may be under IMF restrictions so could not help out much. Some of those US allies/vassals in South America may want to help but Venezuela has a lot of people running around with guns and you would not want to be a foreign force stuck in that country. The US has the missiles to hit Venezuela but not the troops to occupy the country. So perhaps it was also a test of how many people in Venezuela would support a colour revolution. Not a lot by the look of it. If Trump was smart he could make a deal with Venezuela for good terms in buying their oil and boast of it but I do not think that the neocons like Rubio will let him. But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump. “But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump.” Thanks for that, Rev. Isn’t the US government sufficiently preoccupied with a very large war and a genocide already? (Not to mention the ever-dreamt about war against China). They also got the boot from the Red Sea by the Yemenis. Why should anyone expect more success against Venezuela? Real empire collapse times going on. If they do in fact try this outlandish idea, I wonder how the public will like seeing US troops returning in coffins, as during Vietnam times. Will the government double down and start a war with Mexico in order to distract from a Venezuelan debacle? At that rate, it’ll eventually have to be at war against the entire planet. The US will not be sending 4,000 troops into battle in Venezuela. It would be a massacre. As mentioned in my previous post, if this does kick off (still a reasonably large “IF”), the US will be waging hybrid warfare against Venezuela (cyberattacks, attacks on infrastructure, maybe even drone and missile attacks like in Iran) while hoping the locals do all the heavy lifting. The only ones occupying body bags and coffins, I imagine, will be Venezuelans and other South Americans. You’re probably right on that count (since time immemorial the ones to pay the price of the Monroe Doctrine have been the South and Central Americans, not US citizens); but given the tremendously self-destructive activity the US has been engaging on (the tariffs being the most egregious example), I’ve become quite unsure about US rationality. Maybe a waning power could be delusional enough to think a few thousand troops would somehow collapse the government. And yeah, if they do try it’s going to make the Bay of Pigs look good. Just spitballing here off of Nick’s comment above, but maybe the force that will fight the Venezuelans is meant to come from Colombia. It seems very odd to me that Colombia would amass military forces on the border with Venezuela and this would be described as a “show of support”. It also could be labeled as a possible invasion force. It’s also extremely odd that the president of Colombia would send a large number of troops to that border when it is currently being heavily attacked by FARC dissidents in the last couple of weeks. How would the military feel about having been attacked in country by their own drug cartels, that they are now being sent as defenders of Venezuela, which is accused of supporting drug cartels? (Not that I believe this propaganda at all, but of course some of the military in Colombia might.) How good is Petro’s relationship with his own military? The military was previously fighting the FARC, but under Petro the fight was dropped. The military must not be happy with this. Further spitballing, you say that Guyana used to be a British colony. British intelligence is famous for highly deceptive plots. That’s also throw in Israeli intelligence given their meddling in this affair, and we’ve also got the French on side. This plot could not only be seen as a way to attack Venezuela, but also as a way to destabilize Colombia and bring a military coup there. Now obviously these are just fever dreams I’m having, but I wanted to share them anyway, just in case others may contribute more info. As an aside, I am currently in Bogota again for the next week. Things seem peaceful and normal here from what I see in my very safe neighborhood. I will ask my host about this issue, he seems pretty well informed generally. saludos I was wondering if China’s investments in Venezuela have included some shore based anti-ship missiles? Wouldn’t surprise me. Russia’s definitely helping Venezuela to manufacture munitions. Iran has been helping them develop drones for over a decade. The Houthis showed that if you repeatedly launch missiles at US Navy vessels, their A/D rapidly depletes and they turn tail (I mean strategically retreat to reload) for the northern hemisphere. Not the big showy success Trump craves. And if Venezuela chooses (i.e., US missile damage to Venezuela is more than minor), a large drone (to deplete A/D) and missile wave will overwhelm the US (poorly performing) A/D, sinking thousands of sailors to Davy Jones’ Locker. My SWAG is that this possibility will underlie a TACO Tuesday. We might see a performative missile attack, ala Iran. Sending sailors to Davy Jones’ locker would be counterproductive, because it would be used as a discount 9/11 to manufacture consent for yet another war. Idiotic US population would fall far it, no doubt. I have already seen Alex Jones making a pro-war video. Since this is a family blog, I will restrain from commenting further on that, and leave this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77dDZOwt20E Venezuela just need to launch cheap drones in the general direction of US ships. No guidance or warheaed needed. US ships would have to shoot them, because they can’t gamble on which ones are potentially deadly, and which ones are not. After they shoot their wad, they will do Sir Robin maneuver, and bravely run away. Mauro Marcano, a journalist, was murdered for shedding light over the “Cartel de los soles” already back in 2004. Courts later sided with the drug lord who arranged his murder. https://rsf.org/en/victory-impunity-court-acquits-alleged-drug-baron-journalists-murder It is a shame that over 20 year later there still seem to be doubts about the Cartel’s existence. I think the point is that while there are certainly people in high places taking kickbacks from actual drug lords, this may not constitute a “cartel” by the normal definition of the word. I did check the link and I’m not all that familiar with Reporters Without Borders, but a glance at the home page indicates that they coincidentally have a lot of beefs with the very countries the US would like to regime change. Anybody else know more about this group? Another compromised NGO? Just because something existed 20 years ago does not mean it exists now. Given the US’ repeatedly proven propensity just to lie when it wants to and inability to provide evidence, my money is on it not existing; otherwise t would be splashed all over network news by now. FWIW, I’m currently reading Provoked by Scott Horton. While he clearly has an agenda, his references appear to be incredibly comprehensive. The book documents the absolutely vomit-inducing hypocrisy and mendacity of Washington over decades of war mongering, regime change, and war crimes. A distinctive element of the 2025 World Drug Report is its minimal mention of Venezuela, stating only a marginal fraction of Colombian drug production passes through the country to the Caribbean, US and Europe. The report from the highest global institution coordinating government drug policies makes no mention of the so-called Cartel of the Suns, which allegedly operates from Venezuela. For comparison, the European Drug Report 2025: Trends and Progress, published by the European Union, mentions no role for Venezuela as an international drug trafficking corridor. Though the European report states cocaine is the second most used drug in the EU’s 27 countries, Venezuela is unmentioned. Significant references appear for Colombia and Ecuador. https://orinocotribune.com/un-and-eu-confirm-venezuela-far-from-being-a-narco-country/ Well, the acquitted defendant, Garcia, was extradited from Trinidad to Venezuela and charged by the Venezuelan government. The murdered man had accused him of being the “head” of a cartel by that name, but I don’t see where he provided any evidence. In any case, Garcia seems to have had no government connections and the fact that he fled to Trinidad and was extradited suggests that he had no expectation of impunity. The cartel in this case, if it existed, would seem to have been a localised one, sharing nothing but maybe a name with the massive spectre supposedly headed by Maduro The global saber-rattling will ensure that more of all countries’ budgets go to military and surveillance spending rather than other needs for the people of various states. Everywhere one turns, there are military maneuvers. That is considered a win for those with infected with rabid neoliberal economic ideology. In addition to profits for the prison/detention industrial complex and redefining immigration statuses, the border lock-down frenzy is also happening in anticipation more conflict causing destabilization in all parts of the world. What’s more frightening than the usual strategy of “let’s find a country we can rape and steal its oil” is that the deep state and all the other nut-case neocons are thinking again in Zbigniew Brzezinski “Big Picture” terms, as “we may have to give up on the Eastern Hemishpere, so let’s really double down on controlling the other half of the planet.” Kind of like a new Monroe Doctrine. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. I don’t understand why these countries can’t simply exchange oil for equipment and goods. Wouldn’t that allow them to bypass USA sanctions? Am I missing something? This kind of trade has been common for centuries.” I think you are misreading that. Venezuela has been badly hurt by US sanctions. There is no suggestion that China is bothered by some need to trade in US dollars. It may well be that you are correct and Venezuela and China are doing an oil for equipment swap while the USA grinds its teeth in fury. @nick Corbishley this YouTube video by “#RichardWolff” discusses the reasons why Venezuela is so important do the United States and China in terms of geopolitics. At least I think it’s Wolff, based on the title, the image and the voice. But there are no details that confirm it’s actually him. I remember seeing that @Richard Wolff reads this blog and comments occasionally, hopefully he will confirm or deny the veracity of this being him. At any rate though the analysis is very interesting. Completely ridiculous considering the well documented US involvement in the drug trade. Perhaps they will look in the mirror and demand to arrest themselves. Uribe next door had a long history with the cartels, and he was a big US favorite. There are plenty of real targets if they are interested. They used to talk about the oil. At least that was more honest. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: TSMC Stock: Wall Street’s Most Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/tsmc-stock-wall-streets-most-overlooked-ai-play/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T10:00:51Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has emerged as a notable beneficiary of the AI revolution. While TSMC serves as the backbone of the globe’s most sophisticated chip manufacturing supply chain, its stock has only risen about 18% year-to-date – significantly lower than U.S.-based chip companies like AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD), which is up 38%, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) which has seen a 31% increase, and the struggling Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has achieved a gain of nearly 20%. This relative underperformance becomes even more pronounced when considering the company’s robust growth outlook, increasing profit margins, and a valuation that is more attractive than that of most competitors. TSMC’s facilities are not merely production plants; they rank among the most strategically vital assets on Earth, producing the processors that power iPhones, electric vehicles, AI data centers, and nearly every cutting-edge device, allowing investors to actually hold a share of them. At current multiples, this segment of global infrastructure doesn’t appear excessively priced, either. The investment rationale for TSMC is grounded in its prominent position in advanced chip manufacturing. As the largest semiconductor foundry globally, it produces a significant portion of the world's most advanced chips. In Q2 2025, revenues surged 44% year-over-year to $30.07 billion, with high-performance computing accounting for 60% of the sales composition and smartphone chips contributing another 27%. In total, TSMC produces about two-thirds of the world’s semiconductors – and an even larger share of AI-optimized chips. This dominance stems from the company's leadership in advanced process technology. TSMC already commands the 3nm and 5nm nodes and is advancing into the 2nm "gate-all-around" technology this year, solidifying its leadership position. Advanced nodes (3nm, 5nm, 7nm) represent nearly 74% of TSMC’s production. In the AI sector, its standing is even more formidable. TSMC’s 3nm and upcoming 2nm nodes, together with cutting-edge packaging technologies crucial for AI accelerators, provide a technological advantage that competitors cannot replicate. Its enormous scale and unparalleled reliability have established it as the go-to provider for all significant AI chip manufacturers – from Nvidia and AMD to hyperscalers that design custom silicon. While companies like Intel have made strides toward more advanced nodes like the 18A process, they are usually far behind TSMC regarding yield rates and efficiency. The 2nm Race: Intel’s 18A Faces Uphill Task Against TSMC The growth prospects appear even more appealing. TSMC anticipates overall revenue growth of 30% in 2025, while its AI-centric business alone is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 40% in the foreseeable future, starting from its 2024 base. Industry projections estimate AI infrastructure spending to reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. With TSMC supplying the advanced chips that drive AI systems, the company has a lengthy growth trajectory ahead. Additionally, there are favorable policies at play. TSMC has received a reprieve from President Trump’s 100% chip tariffs as it has been expanding its operations in the U.S. New fabrication plants in the U.S. and Japan are also intended to reduce the geopolitical concentration risks associated with Taiwan. The company’s balance sheet is equally robust, featuring $86 billion in cash and marketable securities against approximately $29 billion in long-term debt. The margins further highlight the strength of the company’s business model. Gross margins hover around 59%, while operating margins climbed to nearly 50% in the last quarter – reflecting a solid 700 basis points increase from a year prior. This illustrates pricing power, efficiency, and its ability to outperform competitors like Intel and Samsung, who continue to face challenges with transitioning to next-generation nodes. Nonetheless, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 24x, TSMC appears significantly less expensive than most U.S. chip design companies, especially given its unparalleled technology, scale, and structural exposure to AI. Given its strong growth, resilient margins, and a valuation that hasn’t yet aligned with its peers, TSMC could be one of the most overlooked opportunities to capitalize on the AI chip surge. It’s important to note, however, that no investment story is devoid of risks. The most apparent overhang is geopolitical: tensions between China and Taiwan cast a substantial shadow over TSMC’s global dominance. While overseas fabs alleviate concentration concerns, they also tend to increase costs. Another potential risk is disappointment in growth outside of AI. Apple, which stands as one of TSMC's largest clients, has encountered sluggish demand in recent quarters, and broader consumer electronics spending might impact non-AI segments adversely. The rising requirements for capital expenditure could also put pressure on free cash flow, even if margins remain strong. While TSMC stock may seem risky, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they have provided a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Netflix Stock Worth The Risk At $1,200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/netflix-stock-worth-the-risk-at-1200/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T09:30:49Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ: NFLX) has experienced significant growth, increasing by approximately 35% this year and over 70% in the last twelve months. The stock is now priced at over $1,200. This substantial rise follows two strategic decisions made by Netflix after the pandemic: enforcing restrictions on password sharing and introducing a more affordable, ad-supported tier. Both strategies have proven effective, enhancing subscriber numbers and providing a considerable revenue boost, with Q2 sales increasing by 16% compared to the previous year. Clearly, things have been going well. However, here lies the issue – these strategies are now being utilized in most markets, content expenses are rising, competitors are active, and the stock is currently valued for absolute success. When performance is so strong, it can be tempting for investors to assume that this momentum will continue indefinitely. This is precisely when potential risks are often overlooked. In 2024 alone, Netflix added more than 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber total to nearly 302 million, marking the largest annual growth in its history. The crackdown on password-sharing has encouraged users to either pay additional fees for extra access or enroll independently. Moreover, the ad-supported tier, which offers a more budget-friendly entry option, has experienced robust uptake, with more than half of new subscribers in eligible markets opting for this plan in the latest quarter. These changes have opened up new revenue avenues and reignited growth after a plateau following the pandemic. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns regarding future developments. With both strategies already in place in significant markets, maintaining the same rate of subscriber growth could be challenging. Additionally, Netflix has declared that it will cease reporting subscriber figures starting in 2025, signaling expectations for slower growth going forward. The competition is intensifying once again. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+ are reinforcing their focus on content and bundling initiatives. While Netflix’s extensive content library and scale still provide it an advantage, competitors are capitalizing on unique strengths. For example, Disney packages Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together for as low as $17 per month, making the service more engaging and reducing subscriber turnover. Importantly, Disney can justify its substantial streaming investments because it profits from its intellectual property across parks, merchandise, and film releases. See How Disney Stock Can Surge To $230 Despite the surge in subscriber numbers, concerns regarding pricing, expenses, and broader economic conditions persist. Netflix has continuously raised subscription rates. Its premium plan now costs $25 per month, while the standard HD plan has increased by $2.50 to $18. While price increases may enhance margins in the short term, they also pose a risk of alienating cost-conscious users, particularly amid higher inflation and tariffs which could impact disposable income. Content costs represent another hurdle. Netflix has ventured into live sports broadcasting, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which come with higher production and licensing expenses. Although margins improved in Q2, management has warned that operating margins could decline in the latter half of 2025 due to increased amortization and marketing expenses linked to its new offerings. Netflix is projected to spend over $20 billion yearly on content by 2026, an increase from approximately $17 billion in 2024. At its current valuation, Netflix trades at roughly 47 times the consensus earnings for 2025, compared to about 20 times in mid-2022. This premium valuation presumes that the company can maintain double-digit growth and margin expansion in the long term. However, consensus forecasts indicate revenue growth of only 15% to 13% for 2025 and 2026, which falls short of its historical growth rate. With increasing costs, slowing subscriber additions, and rising competition, Netflix may struggle to substantiate its current valuation. In contrast, Disney stock trades at approximately 20 times forward earnings with a market cap of $200 billion, while its direct-to-consumer segments generated $24.15 billion in revenue over the past 12 months compared to Netflix’s $41 billion. This suggests that Disney’s valuation may be underestimated given its strengths in streaming and highlights why Netflix’s inflated stock price might face downward pressure if growth slows. Worried about Netflix stock’s high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a strong history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?In aggregate, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a more stable investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Crypto ETF market expands with 92 filings awaiting SEC decision
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-etf-market-expands-with-92-filings-awaiting-sec-decision/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T08:03:22Z

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now faces one of its heaviest backlogs in the digital asset space, with at least 92 cryptocurrency exchange-traded product applications awaiting review. According to an expert, Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) lead the wave of filings, each with multiple applications under consideration. The trend highlights growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure through regulated investment vehicles, even as the SEC continues to weigh its stance on crypto products. The pace of new filings has accelerated in recent months, suggesting the market is preparing for a broader expansion of crypto ETFs. Solana and XRP have emerged as the frontrunners among altcoins in ETF interest. Analyst James Seyffart reported that Solana currently has eight ETF applications pending, while XRP has seven. Both tokens rank among the most actively pursued crypto assets after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on April 21 that 72 crypto-related ETFs were already awaiting SEC review at that time. With the figure now at 92, a further 20 applications have been added in just four months, pointing to rising momentum across the industry. The filings include proposals offering exposure not only to Solana and XRP but also to other altcoins, alongside three ETFs linked to Bitcoin and Ether. Two of the largest players in the digital asset space, Grayscale and 21Shares, are also part of the current SEC queue. Both are seeking approval for Ether staking ETFs. Earlier this month, the SEC clarified that some liquid staking activities fall outside its regulatory scope, a development that may impact how such filings are assessed. Grayscale is also pursuing a major conversion of five of its existing trusts into ETFs. These include three publicly traded funds and two private trusts, covering exposure to Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. Such conversions would expand ETF access across a broader set of cryptocurrencies if approved. The potential impact of SEC decisions on altcoin markets remains a key focus for traders. Analysts at Bitfinex observed on Monday that a broader rally among altcoins is unlikely until more crypto ETFs gain approval. This view underscores the role regulatory clarity could play in shaping institutional and retail participation in the sector. Meanwhile, market commentators such as NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci have pointed to the sheer volume of filings as evidence of what they call “crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon”. While new applications continue to pile up, global asset manager BlackRock has already secured a commanding lead in the crypto ETF category. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has attracted net inflows of $58.28 billion since launch. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has accumulated $13.12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. A Wednesday report also indicated that ETHA may soon surpass Coinbase as the largest single holder of Ether. Notably, IBIT now generates more annual fee revenue for BlackRock than its flagship S&P fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). This is due to the fee structure, with IBIT carrying an expense ratio of 0.25%, compared to just 0.03% for IVV.

We're watching the systematic dismantling of human imagination, and we need to think about how to respond. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As a journalist, I've had a lot of press releases and other communications lately about how AI is "democratising creativity". And I won't lie, I can see the logic in that. Most of us have found that tools ranging from ChatGPT to Adobe Firefly Boards have helped us out in some way or other (see here how AI is impacting graphic design). But there's a very big flipside to all of this. Let's not forget that, right now, the creative industries are having their guts ripped out by artificial intelligence. And the worst part? We're all just standing around watching it happen. To take just one example, WPP – yes, that WPP, the advertising behemoth that once symbolised British creative dominance – recently axed 7,000 jobs. Seven thousand. That's not downsizing; that's a creative apocalypse. But is this wise? To my mind, the advertising industry has always been built on a fundamental truth: humans buy from humans. We respond to stories, emotions, and that indefinable spark of creativity that makes us stop scrolling. And that can't be faked (as Will Smith just found out). Remember one of the best ads ever, that Cadbury gorilla drumming to Phil Collins? Pure human madness that somehow worked perfectly. Try explaining that brief to an algorithm. Yet here we are, reading Meta's Mark Zuckerberg promise in July that businesses won't need "any creative, any targeting, any measurement" because the AI software Meta is developing will handle everything. This isn't just happening in the advertising world, either. The tech industry has shed over 22,000 jobs in 2025, with a shocking 16,084 layoffs in February alone. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta have all been slicing through workforces whilst simultaneously investing billions in the AI tech making jobs obsolete. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Meanwhile, the IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality. Anecdotally, most freelancers have seen demand drop due to AI, including myself. Which is not surprising when illustrators, copywriters, designers and others, who've spent years honing their craft, are being told their skills are now available in a software package for $20 a month. Already dealing with late payments and low fees, freelancers now face competing with algorithms that don't need sleep, don't demand payment, and definitely don't complain about unreasonable deadlines. Tech companies love to frame this carnage as "democratisation." I think a better word, though, might be "homogenisation". When everyone has access to the same AI tools, trained on the same datasets, we don't get diversity – we get a creative monoculture. Yes AI can churn out perfectly adequate content at lightning speed. But in the process, it's creating a tsunami of forgettable mediocrity. Indeed, every time I look at Facebook ads these days, I feel like I'm drowning in AI-generated imagery that looks like it was designed by committee in a parallel universe where humans have never experienced joy; glossy, idealised, and slightly plasticky looking. So what do we do? Well, perhaps we stop pretending this is inevitable. After all, every AI implementation is a choice, every job cut is a decision. We can choose differently. Should creatives start to get militant? The Hollywood writers' strike showed that organised resistance works; they secured protections against AI replacement. Maybe artists, illustrators, designers, photographers and others need to fight to similar safeguards... before there's nothing left to protect. Because make no mistake: 2025 will be remembered as the year creativity went to war with artificial intelligence – and lost the first battle. We're not just losing jobs. We're losing the messy, unpredictable, gloriously human process of creation itself. Unless we act now, we'll be living in a world where creativity is just another task for machines to optimise.

The second-largest crypto is up more than 17% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin’s negative return of 5.5%, CoinGecko data shows. It follows a record setting run earlier this week, where Ethereum climbed to $4,945, its highest ever price, on Sunday. “Ethereum offers a dynamic growth story,” Xu Han, director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, told Decrypt. He pointed to deflationary tokenomics post-Merge, scalability via Layer-2 adoption, and a yield-bearing staking model. On the last point, the amount of Ethereum that has been deployed for staking activity has continued to rise this year, reaching a record 35,750 ETH, or roughly $169 million, on August 2, according to data analytics platform Beaconchain. While that figure has effectively plateaued in recent weeks, structural advantages, combined with its role as the foundational layer for DeFi and tokenization, continue to attract institutional inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds, Han said. As of August, no U.S. Ethereum staking ETFs have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though some, including digital asset manager BlackRock, are hopeful that could soon change. Still, the attention remains fixed on the spot-based products, where Ethereum ETFs have staged a comeback after weathering outflows totaling $237.7 million from August 15 through to August 20. As of this week, Ethereum ETFs have garnered over $1.2 billion in inflows through Thursday, according to data from SoSoValue. Elsewhere in the market, Solana has begun to outpace its peers with a 7% gain noted since mid-August, coinciding with a 31% surge in Solana’s DEX volume to $5.10 billion over the past week, per DeFiLlama. Though it faces its own troubles with retail traders on Solana-based decentralized exchanges having pivoted away from speculative meme coin trading, leading to a crunch in the daily DEX trader count.

Even if his dream of reunification was never fully realised, Éamon de Valera’s tireless aspirations made him a hero in so many Irish people’s eyes Éamon de Valera in 1932 when he was minister for external affairs. Photo: Getty In the Ireland into which I was born in the early 1940s, nobody loomed larger than our taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, who died on this day 50 years ago. He was widely revered as a national saviour, but also distrusted – even hated – by many others. His merits, or lack thereof, were endlessly debated. My mother admired him, my father did not. Most mornings Dev made his way to his office in town from his home in Cross Avenue, which was situated at the back of his beloved Blackrock College.

Title: Letters: Why divided Labour Party should pull a Rabbitte out of the hat in race for Áras

Former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte could be just the solution for party members to resolve differences concerning presidential election nomination One might think a small party like Labour could pull together. However, former leader Alan Kelly has caused quite a stir by saying he is opposed to its endorsement of Independent TD Catherine Connolly as a presidential election candidate. Mr Kelly has proved himself by surviving in the cockpit of North Tipperary in the last few elections. He is still well thought of in political circles, so his opposition is a blow to the party and leader Ivana Bacik. I may have a solution for Labour. Why not pull “a Rabbitte” out of the hat? The Labour Party should go cap in hand to Pat, another former leader, and beg him to be its candidate. I have always said he is the only credible Labour candidate for this election. He comes from the west of Ireland and has represented Dublin for many years and still has a profile. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo An Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, mostly journal­ists and medics (‘Israel claims ‘double-tap’ strike on hospital that killed 20, including five journalists, targeted Hamas camera’, Irish Independent, August 26), has been justified by Israel because of a “surveillance camera”. Really? A camera? People who are starving, with little drinking water, no medicine and no hope of any shipments due to the Israeli control of aid and access are able to get high-tech equipment somehow and then decide to install it in their hospitals? Israel is so used to getting away with excuses that lack truth that it will tell the media just about anything. We could ask why it had to bomb the camera when there were journal­ists and medics responding to the first bomb. Why not take out the camera at 3am to minimise civilian casualties? Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Israel continues its massacres in Gaza; Russia continues the slaughter in Ukraine. The international comm­unity and the UN have failed. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize. Solution: President Trump stops all US support for Israel and maximises US support for Ukraine. The wars end. President Trump wins the Nobel Prize. The global economy improves. US businesses thrive. This makes America great again. Chris Fitzpatrick, Dublin 6 The recent meeting of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders seems to have left us with more questions than answers. Trump indicated broadly that America would support the security of Ukraine. However, no specifics were given, as is the case with many of Trump’s statements. Apparently, land exchanges were part of the private discussions between the leaders. At this crucial juncture, it would be more beneficial for Ukraine to exchange land with the US as a pay-off for security now and into the future. After all, Trump is a transactional president, and it would also be in ­Europe’s interest in the longer term. Talks of bilateral and trilateral meetings, and the protracted nature of these, could well expose us to the volatile side of Trump and leave Ukraine totally exposed. Denis O Keeffe, Lisnagry, Co Limerick At a demonstration outside the Irish Central Bank this week, Dr Bridget Kiely called on Irish people to seek options to drugs made by Israeli firms (‘Hundreds rally against Central Bank role in Israeli “war bonds”’, Irish independent, August 27). The most famous of the Israeli drug firms is Teva. It has two facilities in Ireland that employ 650 highly skilled people. Its output is supplied to the HSE and also exported to 30 countries. Why should Irish jobs be put in jeopardy when, to end the war in Gaza, Hamas has only to release its Israeli hostages, disarm and disband? Karl Martin, Dublin 13 The Pope should go to Gaza. Until now, his approach has been entirely vocal and diplomatic – his actions have been limited to public statements, telegrams and high-level phone calls. The world’s collective conscience has finally awoken and public opinion has undergone a seismic shift, with people publicly demonstrating their horror and revulsion at the genocide in Gaza. A population is being annihilated, and this is why Pope Leo should go to Gaza. The Pope is in a unique position, invested with a universally recognised moral authority. Now is the time to eschew diplomacy for moral leadership. Action, not rhetoric, will honour Christ’s example. Eileen Seery, Gorey, Co Wexford It was heartbreaking to learn that on Wednesday, two children aged eight and 10 were killed and 17 other people were injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. I get so angry when I hear how easy it is to obtain a gun in the US. In America, gun ownership is a widespread and complex issue, with a diverse range of perspectives. About 77 million adults own guns there, with self-protection being the main reason for having them. However, views on gun control and the role of firearms in society vary widely, even within different groups of gun owners. It’s when one hears of a tragedy, such as the one in Minneapolis, that one would hope the powers that be in the US might consider banning ownership of guns. If the American authorities ignore such a call, we will be hearing about more of these awful tragedies. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary With regard to the Leaving Cert, I read somewhere that 70pc of pupils negotiate maths very well. Alas, I am with the remaining 40pc.

Reliance AGM 2025: Reliance Industries’ AGMs have disappointed investors for four straight years, with shares slipping each time.

Ahead of today’s AGM, expectations are muted, with brokerages suggesting this could finally leave room for a positive surprise if Mukesh Ambani delivers on growth cues across Jio, Retail, and New Energy.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia

Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday. The results were driven by “strength in migrations,” according to Citi analysts, suggesting “large enterprises' increasing budget allocation towards database modernization as part of AI projects.” UBS analysts pointed to several other reasons, aside from AI hype, to be optimistic about the prospects for technology stocks this year. "Second-quarter earnings for big tech have been robust and broad-based, with most companies beating both sales and EPS estimates," the analysts wrote. They expect tech earnings to grow 15% this year, and hold in the low teens next year. Earnings should be boosted in the near term by U.S. dollar weakness. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 10% since the start of the year, a decline that, by UBS estimates, should translate to a roughly 2.5% increase in the S&P 500's earnings. "We see more room for the US dollar to decline from current levels, with the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle set to kick off next month." High stock valuations have been a recurring source of anxiety for tech investors throughout the AI rally. "Valuations are currently at the upper end of historical ranges," the analysts note, but recent surveys of individual investors and assessments of institutional portfolios suggest there's room for the market to become even more bullish on mega-cap tech stocks.

August 28, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Novo To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Novo between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Index Tops 6500 After Nvidia Earnings; Hormel Drops

Major U.S. equities indexes rose as investors digested quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA), the world's highest valued company, and a report showing a positive revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% on Thursday, securing a second straight all-time closing high and finishing a day above 6500 for the first time. The Dow gained 0.2%, joining the broader benchmark index in record closing territory, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%, closing just below its record level. Nvidia, for its part, fell less than 1%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Datadog (DDOG) shares logged the S&P 500's top daily performance, jumping 7%. Thursday's surge for Datadog stock added to gains posted in the previous session following a strong earnings report from fellow database software specialist MongoDB (MDB). Datadog has launched several new products this year that leverage artificial intelligence technology to enhance its platform's database-monitoring capabilities, helping revenue growth. Shares of Fair Isaac (FICO), the data analytics company known for its consumer credit scores, advanced 6.1%. The stock has come under pressure in recent months following criticism of its pricing scheme by William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who announced in July that mortgage lenders would be able to use FICO competitor VantageScore to evaluate the credit of potential borrowers. Some analysts have lately grown more positive on the shares, citing among other reasons its pricing strength for credit evaluations. Agilent Technologies (A) surpassed sales and profit expectations for its fiscal third quarter, and shares of the health sciences company gained 5.3%. The company also issued stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, highlighting strong demand in its pharmaceutical end markets and its chemicals and advanced materials segment. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares plummeted 13%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. The maker of deli meats and parent company of brands including Spam and Skippy reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter, topping revenue estimates but falling short of adjusted profit expectations. The company attributed its lackluster performance to increases in commodity input costs. Hormel expects this trend to continue in the current quarter and said it plans pricing action to address the inflationary pressure. Cooper Companies (COO) lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025, citing soft demand for contact lenses, and shares of the medical device maker dropped nearly 13%. Cooper's revenue for the third quarter also missed analysts' forecasts, although adjusted profit came in slightly ahead of estimates. Citi analysts downgraded Cooper stock to "neutral" from "buy." Shares of Brown-Forman (BF.B) sank 4.9% after the alcoholic beverage maker reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal first quarter. Although the Jack Daniel's parent slightly surpassed estimates with its top-line results for the period, boosted by demand for its ready-to-drink beverages, sales were down from a year ago. The company discussed consumer uncertainty amid the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, noting that the absence of U.S.-made spirits in most Canadian markets added to pressure on its international business.

Title: The AI bubble may be about to pop — here’s what MIT’s 95% failure stat means

Full Content:
The AI bubble might be closer to bursting than anyone wants to admit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI market is undeniably booming. The six companies at the top of the world's valuation index, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are all deeply invested in AI in some form, and it seems like US stock markets are largely being held afloat by the unbelievable profits raked in by the firms. NVIDIA, the company supplying the world with an estimated 90% of the specialized GPUs required in AI data centers, recently became the first company to hit (and surpass) a $4 trillion market valuation. Microsoft also passed the $4 trillion valuation milestone roughly a week later, and it has invested a massive sum in OpenAI, its ChatGPT LLM, and Windows 11's Copilot AI assistant. Despite all of the promises and hypotheses from major AI players as to what their technology will unleash on the world, for good or for bad, tech trends and major studies have increasingly pointed to the AI boom being one massive bubble that will rival (or surpass) the dot-com era. A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative — a program designed to help develop a "true internet of AI agents" — suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage (via Fortune). A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage. MIT's research involves surveys and interviews with hundreds of employees and heads of firms, as well as outside analysis of hundreds of AI pilot programs that may or may not have found success before completely stalling out. What are those other 95% of AI pilot programs doing to fail? MIT's report suggests that it's the enterprise sector and its inability to easily adapt to AI tools that's the issue, rather than a lack of quality in the offered AI models. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. As Fortune points out, resource misallocation is also a cause, with "more than half of generative AI budgets" being spent on marketing tools rather than what makes the most money — using AI to automate and streamline. MIT's paper arrives about a month after a report from Gartner predicted that "at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025." When nearly every AI pilot winds up a cautionary tale, the most exceptional successes now stand out, not because they cracked some secret algorithm, but because they treated AI like any other high-stakes investment. The 5% that succeed start with a problem worth solving. Successful companies are not after generative AI because it's trendy, but because they are chasing inefficiencies or opportunities with measurable upside. That means setting KPIs (key performance indicators) before a line of code is written and attaching those metrics directly to revenue, cost savings, or reduced risk. They also build for adoption, not just proof-of-concept glory. Good pilots are built to fit in with what already exists with as little friction as possible, and the step from "pilot" to "production" should feel effortless. Finally, they have champions at every level—from engineers who can iterate rapidly to executives who appreciate their strategic value and are willing to protect the project from short‑term budget cutbacks. That cross-functional alignment maintains momentum when early results are messy and is usually the difference between a pilot that scales and one that stalls. In short, the successful 5% aren't just lucky. They are disciplined, purposeful, and relentlessly focused on business outcomes. Following the release of the MIT NANDA paper, tech stocks in the US shed about $1 trillion worth of value over the course of four days. The main culprit? Overevaluation of AI companies that have no problem sucking up billions of dollars in investments, with meager results to show. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — creator of the most popular AI model, ChatGPT — didn't help the situation. Five days earlier, The Verge interviewed Altman and quoted him as saying that AI is in a bubble. When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Altman's comments arrived following the disastrous rollout of OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5. GPT-5, which Altman hyped to incredible heights, was so bad that it forced OpenAI to resurrect older models, including GPT-4o. The catch? GPT-4o is no longer free, forcing users to pay a monthly subscription to return to what they viewed as the superior AI model. OpenAI's failure to live up to its GPT-5 promises didn't come out of nowhere. A report from 2024 suggested that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic had hit a wall in terms of developing advanced AI models. Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, predicted in 2023 that this type of plateau seen with GPT-5 would play out at some point. Consumer perception is not only a PR problem; it's a measure of survival. Now, AI is caught up in a hype wave that's half excitement, half suspicion. Each over‑promised rollout (hello there, GPT‑5) erodes public trust. When users feel like they're beta-testing half-baked technology, they're less likely to stick around — and less likely to rave about it within their companies or networks. Gary Marcus, a psychologist, cognitive scientist, and AI researcher who publishes the "Marcus on AI" Substack and newsletter — of which I've been an avid reader for the past 16 months — has also been sounding the AI bubble alarm for several years. A recent entry published August 20 from Marcus highlights the MIT NANDA study, stock market concerns, and the changing temperature surrounding AI firms and their promises. Marcus originally broached the AI bubble subject when OpenAI was still working with GPT-2, positing that the economics of AI simply don't make sense. As Marcus says, "But until recently enthusiasm kept rising and rising, no matter what I said." But then we all saw what happened with GPT-5; Altman spent years promising the moon, and in the end, long overdue, didn’t even come close to delivering. A lot of people took note. Leading figures in the AI world haven't been shy about laying out the destruction that AI will bring to white collar job sectors and even to humanity itself. And there's certainly the potential for this sort of dystopian future to arrive. But as I (and many others) have begun to suspect, these prosthelytizations could be more for the sake of bolstering hype and investments than accurate warnings of the future. AI has the potential to do great things, and I don't imagine it's going anywhere in the near future. But is there an inflating bubble that's threatening now more than ever to pop? Absolutely. What are your thoughts on the recent MIT study and the implications it has on the AI market? Is AI overhyped and in a massive bubble? Let me know in the comments section below!

August 28, 2025 13:17 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Highlights Dollar General posted net sales of $10.7 billion and net income of $411 million, beating expectations as value-driven shoppers turned to its stores amid inflationary pressures. The company plans nearly 4,900 real estate projects in fiscal 2025, including 575 new stores, 15 in Mexico, and over 4,200 remodels across its Elevate and Renovate initiatives. Dollar General paused expansion of its high-margin pOpshelf concept but continues investing in digital convenience, including expanded delivery and same-day service.

Δ Dollar General said during its Thursday (Aug. 28) second-quarter 2025 earnings call that its business model is finely tuned to these shifting consumer dynamics. “We are pleased with our strong second-quarter results, including earnings growth that significantly exceeded our expectations,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a Thursday press release. “Our improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives, is resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition.” For the 13 weeks ended Aug. 1, Dollar General reported net sales of $10.7 billion, a 5.1% increase from $10.2 billion in Q2 2024. Net income reached $411 million, up 10% from $374 million in Q2 2024. While traditionally serving lower-income households, Dollar General increasingly attracts middle- and high-income shoppers trading down amid rising costs and seeking bargain alternatives for routine needs. Read also: As Households Stretch Paychecks, Off-Price Retail Stretches Profits For fiscal 2025, the company expects approximately 4,885 real estate projects, including 575 new stores in the United States and up to 15 in Mexico, the release said. Nearly 4,250 remodels will be completed across the two major initiatives. This level of construction and remodeling is unmatched in the U.S. discount sector and reflects Dollar General’s conviction that small-box convenience remains a durable retail format even in an age of eCommerce and big-box consolidation. In the three-month period representing Q2, the company opened 204 new stores, remodeled 729 locations under “Project Elevate,” remodeled 592 more under “Project Renovate,” and relocated 15 stores, the release said. Projects Elevate and Renovate are not merely cosmetic. Elevate is designed as a partial remodel that refreshes merchandising, reduces maintenance costs and enhances customer experience. Renovate involves full remodels that upgrade layouts, product selections and equipment. Both are intended to improve the balance between the company’s low-margin, high-traffic consumable goods and its high-margin, non-consumable goods. See also: Discounts Lure High-Income Customers to Dollar Stores Dollar General’s management commentary on Thursday’s earnings call illustrated the precarious environment its shoppers face. The company’s core customers are disproportionately affected by inflation, higher rent and energy costs, and resumed student loan repayments. While food and household goods sales have held up, discretionary spending in seasonal, home and apparel categories remains pressured. The sales mix underscores this tension. Consumables accounted for more than 82% of sales in Q2, rising 5% year over year to $8.82 billion, per the press release. Seasonal and home products grew more modestly, while apparel posted only slight gains. The heavy weighting toward consumables secures traffic but dampens gross margin expansion. PYMNTS Intelligence’s July Paycheck-to-Paycheck research showed that 78% of low-income households, defined as those earning less than $50,000 a year, and 66% of middle-income households, defined as those earning between roughly $50,000 and $100,000 a year, said they were living paycheck to paycheck in June. Perhaps the most telling shift in strategy involves Popshelf, Dollar General’s relatively new retail concept aimed at high-margin categories like home décor, beauty and seasonal goods. Originally envisioned as a growth vector, pOpshelf has faced headwinds in the current environment. In Q2, the company operated 180 standalone locations, but it has paused new openings in 2025, Business Back reported Sunday (Aug. 24). Some Popshelf sites are being converted back to Dollar General stores. Despite its brick-and-mortar foundation, Dollar General continues to invest in digital channels. The company partnered with Uber Eats this month to deliver household essentials. In September 2024, it launched same-day home delivery via its own app and website in select markets. That service is rolling out more broadly in 2025, positioning Dollar General to compete for convenience with grocery delivery providers and Walmart’s expansive online network. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has tracked the impact of tariffs on consumers throughout the spring and summer. For example, the June report, “Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability,” showed 47% of U.S. shoppers said they could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs led to supply chain disruptions or higher price tags.

Title: Capcom Has Reportedly Tried And Failed To Remake Dino Crisis A Few Times

Black Myth WukongDino CrisisMorning Checkpoint Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku’s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how Black Myth: Wukong runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake Dino Crisis a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough that it’s not changing its logo after all. Fans have been begging Capcom for a new Dino Crisis for many, many years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes a game with dinosaurs, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of Dino Crisis isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise. The leaker claims that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the Dead Rising sequels, was working on a remake of Dino Crisis before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more Dino Crisis. Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got Resident Evil back on track with RE7, the publisher can get Dino Crisis going again. Here’s something odd: Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, Wukong on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes. This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with Black Myth: Wukong. On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next Tomb Raider game for Amazon, announced another round of layoffs. The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of Tomb Raider” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March. âToday we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted. There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC. âMany studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin earlyâbefore full content build-out. Weâre doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so âoptimize earlyâ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.” Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s Black Panther game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes Shadow of Mordor and Rome: Total War.Â “We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there â and many of them at Monolith â to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new â and that part I can’t tell you yet.” If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&M lore.

What am I humming? Bubble Pop by HyunA, for no particular reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia has been on a tear. Just in case you've been living under a nice mossy rock the past few years, the advent of generative AI has ushered in a golden era for the company. Let's talk some truly eye-watering facts and figures: during Nvidia's Q2 2025 earnings call, the company reported a total revenue of $46.7 billion. Okay, so it's more like a diamond-encrusted-with-foie-gras-on-the-side era, but it's been far from smooth sailing. As such, with the next-gen Rubin architecture just off the horizon and data centre demand continuing to grow, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the aforementioned earnings call, "We advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves." It's bizarre to hear the head of a company making bank say anything to the effect of 'actually, hold your horses,' but Huang advises that Nvidia's AI customers build "data centers on an annual rhythm." Why? There are more than a few potential reasons, ranging from the ever-changing tariff situation in the US, to potential strain on what may well be an AI bubble. But, specifically referring to Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters often used in AI data centres, Huang had this to say: "Right now, the buzz is — I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out." We've also seen stock supply issues on the gaming side. Early supplies of RTX 50-series GPU stock left much to be desired, making it an absolute mission to find a card at MSRP only a few months ago. Still, gaming alone raked in $4.3 billion for Nvidia, according to the Q2 2025 earnings call. Thankfully, it's a little easier to find a 50-series card at a reasonable price now, as our best graphics cards deals guide can attest. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's AI revenue vastly overshadows even the billions made by its gaming division. As such, Huang kept these priorities in sight as he reassured investors that Nvidia was taking steps to avoid similar scarcity with Rubin later this year. In his closing remarks, Huang said, "Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They have all ticked up at TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Given the constantly shifting US tariff situation and its far-reaching effects on the wider geopolitical stage, it's hard to comment on the projected success of even the best laid plans. And then there's the fact that major player Meta is actually looking to downsize its own AI division—could this herald the shape of things to come for AI's place within big tech? If Huang suspects as much, he didn't let on, instead saying, "Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade." 👉Check out our full guide👈 1.

Title: Layoffs are about to hit Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital advertising group
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/martin-sorrell-s4-capital-ad-group-monks-layoffs-imminent-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:33:20Z

Changes are afoot at advertising mogul Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital. On Thursday, Monks, S4 Capital's operating brand, informed staffers of a restructuring that includes layoffs, according to a screenshot of an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider. The slide detailed how employees whose roles could be affected would be informed this week. In the UK, if more than 20 employees are affected by a layoff in a 90-day period, the company is required to enter a collective consultation process with representatives for the employees. S4 is headquartered in the UK. The presentation said that the "reshaping of teams," including reporting lines, redeployment, and changes to roles or departments, would commence on September 5. "Managing our cost base effectively is a key priority in this environment and we have continued to work to streamline and integrate our businesses," an S4 spokesperson said in a statement. The company declined to comment on how many roles would be affected by the restructure. The layoffs come as advertising agencies face multiple challenges, with tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions making marketers cautious about their spending. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has so far proven to be a double-edged sword — helping make agencies more productive and provide consulting services on how to use the technology, while also threatening to automate many of the services that were once outsourced to them. S4 launched in 2018 with a bang, just weeks after Sorrell's bitter exit from WPP, the firm he built over 33 years from a shell company that made shopping baskets to a $20 billion advertising juggernaut. Sorrell set out a vision for S4 to be everything WPP, in his view, was not. Smaller and more nimble, S4 would only focus on digital marketing and would be "faster, better, cheaper" than the incumbents, he said at the time. Sorrell repeated his WPP playbook of building the company through acquisitions — this time at warp speed. S4's fortunes took a turn in 2022. The group was a casualty of the "years of efficiency" undertaken by many Big Tech giants around that time. Tech companies make up a sizable chunk of S4's client portfolio. It also faced internal challenges, including underperformance at some of its agencies and an auditing issue that forced it to delay the release of its annual report that year. S4's market value plunged and has remained depressed, encouraging takeover sharks to circle in recent years. Earlier this month, S4 issued a statement to confirm a press report that it had entered early discussions with the private-equity-backed ad agency MSQ Partners about a possible merger between the two companies. MSQ Partners later issued a statement denying its involvement in those talks. The statement said that while there may have been informal discussions between its majority shareholder, One Equity Partners, and S4, it didn't plan to pursue further talks about a possible transaction. During S4's annual general meeting in June of this year, Sorrell said the agency's 2024 performance had been affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions, high interest rates, and technology clients prioritizing capital expenditure over operating expenditure, such as marketing, amid the AI race. Sorrell said S4 was anticipating better performance in the second half of 2025, having recently picked up new business from the likes of General Motors, Amazon, and T-Mobile. Still, S4 said it expected full-year net revenue to be down this year versus last. "The strategy of S4 Capital remains the same. Our four principles around digital only, data-driven 'faster, better, cheaper and more' or 'speed, quality, value and more' and a unitary structure all appeal strongly, even more so in challenging economic times," the S4 spokesperson's statement said. S4 has been working to improve its operating margins and reduce its net debt, in part by reducing staff through multiple layoffs in recent years. According to the company's latest regulatory statement, its head count has dropped to roughly 6,800 as of August 22, from around 9,000 at its largest. The company is due to release its interim financial results on September 15. Jump to

Title: Concerns Grow As Strategy Issues More Stocks To Buy Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:30:33Z

Strategy’s latest stock sale to buy more Bitcoin has put investor nerves on edge, as numbers and timing raise fresh doubts about shareholder dilution and the company’s funding choices. Based on reports, Strategy changed its public guidance on August 18 and then, within days, moved to issue a large amount of new stock. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn traced the pattern: no fresh issuance on Aug. 3, roughly $18 million on Aug. 10, about $51 million on Aug. 17 — then close to $360 million raised in a single week after the guidance change. That sharp jump in new capital has drawn scrutiny from market watchers who worry the company is leaning on share issuance to keep buying Bitcoin. The new rules link stock sales to something called market net asset value, or mNAV, which compares the company’s share price to the value of its Bitcoin. Strategy running out of steam? 🚂💨 Before Aug 18, almost no new money came into $MSTR: 🔹 Aug 3: $0 🔹 Aug 10: ~$18M 🔹 Aug 17: ~$51M But after they dropped the “no dilution below 2.5x mNAV” promise, $359M was raised by issuing new shares (see tweet below). Policy changed.… https://t.co/nenuT1soI3 pic.twitter.com/pORoidxPhf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 26, 2025 If the stock trades at more than four times its mNAV, the company will sell lots of shares to buy more Bitcoin. If it trades between 2.5 and four times, it will sell some shares, but more carefully. And if the stock drops below 2.5 times, share sales would mostly go toward paying debt or covering dividends instead of buying Bitcoin. Reports add that if Strategy shares trade under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow to repurchase stock. That framework reversed an earlier pledge not to sell shares for Bitcoin purchases when mNAV was below 2.5x — a reversal that critics point to as the key change. According to the company’s SEC filing, nearly $310 million came from at-the-market common stock sales at an average share price of $354, plus roughly $47 million from preferred share classes. In total, the firm raised a little more than $357 million and used the proceeds to buy 3,081 Bitcoin. The purchase pushed its holdings to 632,457 BTC. That stack of 632,457 coins equals roughly 3% of circulating supply, based on market counts cited in filings and market reports. The company’s public target remains at 1 million coins — a goal that, by the reported figures, is now about 60% complete. Investors focused on dilution have reason to be worried. Each new share increases the number of claims on the same Bitcoin pool, and when issuance happens while the stock trades at low multiples to mNAV, existing holders see their per-share Bitcoin backing decline. Reports say Strategy’s debt sits at about 20% of Bitcoin NAV with headroom up to 30%, giving it borrowing room — but choosing to issue equity at low mNAVs still weakens per-share economics.

Title: Tomb Raider Dev Crystal Dynamics Cuts Staff For Second Time This Year

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The latest round of layoffs comes almost two months after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot. By Evan Campbell on August 28, 2025 at 7:04AM PDT Developer Crystal Dynamics is laying off more members from the team, though not detailing the total number of people impacted. This is the second round of cuts at the Tomb Raider studio within the last six months--and the first since the Perfect Dark reboot was canned. On LinkedIn, the official Crystal Dynamics account announced the layoffs. "This decision was not made lightly," the post reads. "It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The language is pretty similar to what Crystal Dynamics stated after 17 people were laid off in March: "We did not make this decision lightly." The biggest known project at Crystal Dynamics currently is the next Tomb Raider. The game starring Lara Croft will be published by Amazon Games, and Crystal Dynamics noted that "the future of Tomb Raider" is "unaffected by this decision." Earlier this year, the developer stated that the next Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark reboot wouldn't be affected by downsizing, either. However, Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark--a game that Crystal Dynamics was co-developing--last month. The other main studio working on the game, The Initiative, was shuttered. Amazon was also previously working on a Tomb Raider show, but that's reportedly dead now. Along with Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is known for the Gex and Legacy of Kain video game franchises.

Title: Plant-Based Savings: Cut Grocery Bills 19% in 15 Minutes

Time Published: 2025-08-28T13:39:49Z

Got 15 minutes and a wallet that's feeling a little light? Here's how to slash your grocery bills while eating amazing plant-based meals. Research shows that switching to a whole-food vegan diet can cut food costs by 19 percentâthat's about $650 in savings per year. The secret isn't complicated: plant-based staples like brown rice, potatoes, and beans are some of the cheapest and healthiest ingredients in the supermarket. Plus, inflation has hit meat at nearly twice the rate of vegetables, making this the perfect time to master these money-saving plant-based hacks. The foundation of budget vegan cooking lies in stocking up on versatile, shelf-stable ingredients that work in dozens of recipes. Dried beans and rice are ridiculously cheap and often overlookedâa 5-pound bag of brown rice plus 2 pounds of frozen broccoli costs about $6 and lasts for weeks. Buying staples in bulk is huge, since these ingredients can transform into burgers, taco fillings, hummus, and much more. Plant proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are economical choices that pack serious nutrition without the premium price tag. Here's where smart pantry building gets interesting: focus on ingredients that multitask across cuisines. That same cup of brown rice gives you 5 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fiber, and when you combine that with half a cup of broccoli, you're up to 7 grams of protein and 5.5 grams of fiber. But the real magic happens when you learn to season these basics differentlyâcumin and lime for Mexican bowls, ginger and soy for Asian stir-fries, or herbs and lemon for Mediterranean grain salads. Pro tip: Hit up Asian or Latin grocery stores for bulk rice, grains, and spices at unbeatable prices. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetablesâthey're flash-frozen at peak ripeness to retain nutrients and cost a fraction of fresh out-of-season produce. Planning isn't just about organizationâit's your secret weapon against impulse buys and food waste. Taking a few minutes before your store trip to map out meals and compile a shopping list saves both time and money. Plan meals around affordable staples like rice, beans, lentils, and seasonal vegetables, then build variety around those base ingredients. Budget-friendly couples have managed to eat for just $15 Canadian per dayâthat's less than $2.50 per meal by focusing on smart planning. The brilliant thing about strategic planning is how it actually unlocks creativity rather than limiting it. When you know you've got rice, black beans, and frozen corn as your weekly foundation, you can transform them with different spice blends: Monday gets Mexican flair with cumin and lime, Wednesday goes Asian with ginger and soy sauce, Friday turns Mediterranean with herbs and lemon. This rotation strategy means you're buying the same affordable base ingredients but never eating boring meals. Build your weekly menu around one-pot meals, grain bowls, and soups that stretch ingredients into multiple servings. Batch cooking is perfect for bulk ingredientsâcook once and you're set for days, saving time you could use for side gigs or just relaxing. Your shopping strategy can make or break your budget. Choose store brands over name brandsâthey're often identical products for a fraction of the cost. Shop the perimeter where whole foods like fresh produce, grains, and legumes live, avoiding the expensive processed foods in center aisles. Embrace "ugly" vegetablesâthat imperfect carrot is just as nutritious as the pristine one but costs way less. Timing your shopping trips strategically can unlock serious savings most people miss entirely. Shop early weekday mornings when stores are fully stocked and crowds are minimal. Focus on seasonal produce when it's abundant and naturally cheaperâsummer squash in July, root vegetables in fall, citrus in winter. Use apps like "Our Groceries" that allow multiple users to update the same listâperfect for couples, roommates, or families who want to coordinate their shopping without duplicate purchases. Shopping rotation hack: Get to know different stores' strengths. Hit budget stores for dried beans, pasta, and canned goods. Save the fancy grocery trips for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty items. Frozen organic vegetables are often much less expensive at warehouse stores like Costco. The magic happens when you learn to make expensive alternatives at home using whole foods. Making seitan costs as little as 50p for a bag of flour versus several dollars for store-bought versions. Aquafaba (that liquid from chickpea cans) whips into mayo in 10 seconds flat. Dehydrated soya chunks can be much cheaper than frozen proteins and rehydrate into satisfying, meaty textures. The learning curve here is gentler than you'd expect, and the payoff is huge. Take that basic tahini dressing: blend tahini, lemon juice, water, and a pinch of salt, and you've got something that costs pennies but rivals expensive store-bought dressings. Store it in the fridge for up to a week, or make flavor variations by adding garlic for punch, herbs for freshness, or maple syrup for subtle sweetness. This one simple sauce elevates everything from grain bowls to roasted vegetables to raw salads. A pack of dried beans yields roughly double its weight when cooked, so 500g gives you the equivalent of four drained tins at a fraction of the cost. Zero-waste cooking means using every part of your ingredients to reduce food waste and get more from what you already have. Save vegetable scraps in the freezer to make broth at homeâthose onion skins, carrot tops, and herb stems create rich, flavorful stock for free. Use all parts of your produce, including dual-use vegetables like carrots with their leafy tops. This isn't about being a perfectionistâit's about being practical with preservation techniques that actually save money. That bunch of cilantro you bought for tacos? Chop the stems into your freezer scrap bag for broth, blend any wilting leaves into ice cube trays with olive oil for instant flavor bombs, or quickly blanch and freeze whole sprigs in bags for later use. These simple preservation methods mean you're getting multiple uses from single purchases. Repurpose leftovers creatively to minimize waste and stretch your grocery dollars. That leftover rice becomes fried rice, grain salads, or soup base. Wilting greens get a second life in smoothies, soups, or pesto. Freeze unused produce before it spoilsâthose browning bananas are perfect for smoothies and baking. The bottom line? Plant-based eating can cost less than $2 per serving with the right approach. Studies consistently show that people eating plant-based spend less on food than any other group, with savings jumping to $900 annually compared to Mediterranean diets. The core of a vegan dietâwhole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruitsâis among the most affordable foods available. You don't need to go full vegan overnight to see these benefits. Start with Meatless Monday and gradually build your confidence with one new plant-based recipe each week. Focus on mastering a few simple, satisfying base recipes firstâlike a versatile grain bowl template or a basic bean and vegetable soupâthen expand your skills as you discover which flavors and techniques you enjoy most. The beauty of this approach is that you're not just saving money now, you're building sustainable cooking skills that compound over time. Your grocery budgetâand your healthâwill reward you for making the switch to these smart, sustainable eating habits.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote.

Title: 150 job applications, rescinded offers: Computer science grads are struggling to find work | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Abraham Rubio has wanted to be a software engineer since childhood. On the gaming platform Minecraft, he loved tinkering with “mods,” or alterations to video games created by fans that change elements like a character’s appearance. Eventually, he wasn’t content with just discovering new mods — he wanted to build his own. That early passion led him to study coding at Bloomfield College of Montclair State University in New Jersey, graduating with a degree in computer science and game programming in May. But finding a software development job has proven challenging. Rubio has applied for 20 roles since graduation. He’s yet to receive an offer. “I go on LinkedIn almost every day, just scrolling, trying to see what opportunities are out there,” he said, adding that he hasn’t “really heard anything back from most companies.” For years — as Silicon Valley boomed and all kinds of companies invested in new tech capabilities — computer science degrees, or even certificates from coding bootcamps, seemed like a golden ticket to a sustainable, well-paying job in a fast-paced industry. But in recent years, job openings have become more competitive and harder to come by. Employment for recent graduates in computer science and math jobs has declined by 8% since 2022, Oxford Economics found in a May report. Postings for software development roles on the job site Indeed fell 71% between February 2022 to August 2025, according to Indeed data shared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. With the tech world racing to make artificial intelligence advancements, some new grads say it feels like an especially exciting time to enter the industry. However, AI is also enabling companies to automate some parts of the coding and software development process, reducing the need for human workers, especially in entry-level roles. While tech giants’ valuations continue to soar, many have undergone multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years as they push to accomplish more work with fewer people, a trend that has only been accelerated by AI. Microsoft, for example, became the second company to reach a $4 trillion valuation last month. That was only weeks after saying it would lay off 9,000 employees in its third round of cuts in recent months. CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of Microsoft’s code was being written by AI. “Tech jobs are good, but I will say, the job market right now makes it seem that it’s almost impossible to get one,” said Julio Rodriguez, who graduated last year from Elms College in Massachusetts. He said it took him more than 150 applications before he got a data engineer job earlier this summer. “And then when you get one, you’re also scared of the many layoffs that many companies are having,” he added. CNN spoke with half a dozen job seekers about how they’re navigating the job market, educators training the industry’s next generation of engineers as well as current coders and tech leaders about whether computer science degrees could become obsolete. Nick Vinokour had a dream job lined up after he graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a computer science degree — he had been hired as a strategic projects lead at data labeling startup Scale AI. He was set to start in August. “I was super excited, it was a great opportunity,” Vinokour said. But after Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI in June, acquiring its CEO, Vinokour got an email saying his offer was being rescinded amid a corporate restructuring. Now, he’s still on the hunt for a job. While Vinokour largely believes the state of the economy and stiff competition among recent computer science graduates are to blame for the tough job market, the role of AI has certainly crossed his mind. AI coding tools such as Microsoft’s Copilot and Anysphere’s Cursor are like “a big tidal wave that’s looming to change what the role of a junior engineer is,” he said. (A Scale spokesperson acknowledged that some employees were laid off or had offers rescinded in July, but said Scale is now aggressively hiring for positions across the company.) Some recent computer science grads have turned to TikTok to share frustrations around the current tech job market. A TikTok user named Lili, who goes by @queenofslack on the app, posted a video last month discouraging other students from studying computer science due to her own difficult job hunt. “I think the investment, the difficulty of (computer science) is not worth the instability of the job,” she said. “If you’re really just being motivated by a paycheck and by a cushy job, I can’t say that I would recommend.” Of the more than 250 comments on the video, dozens were from fellow computer science graduates or students expressing similar concerns about their career path. College graduates, broadly, are struggling. A May report from Oxford Economics found that the unemployment rate for recent grads is now greater than the national average. But for job seekers in tech, the data is especially troubling. The New York Fed now pegs the unemployment rate for recent computer science and computer engineering graduates (6.1% and 7.5%, respectively) higher than that for people who studied art history (3%), English (4.9%) and performing arts (2.7%). Recent grads told CNN that they don’t think AI will do away with software engineering jobs entirely. As Brianne Ford, who graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in May, put it: “Code always needs maintaining.” But there are fears that the technology will usurp opportunities for people looking to break into the field. For entry-level jobs, “they want us to have tons of internships or tons of projects and when you’re in school, you don’t really get as much of a chance,” Ford said. “Me, personally, I worked as a resident advisor to help pay for school.” Vinokour said job seekers his age are in a “pickle” — wanting to take part in the AI boom, but competing against more experienced developers for jobs, especially as some companies slow down or change their hiring plans. “It’s this very weird middle ground that’s exciting because (the industry is) on the precipice of this insane technology. But … it’s harder for a junior engineer to be hired,” Vinokour said. Or as Rubio puts it: “It feels like I’m competing with AI to just try to get my foot in the door.” Some are now reconsidering whether software engineering is truly a viable career path. “I’m pretty pessimistic right now,” said Danny Stalmakov, a Germany-based software developer who graduated with his master’s degree in computer science in 2022. Stalmakov, who said he’s submitted hundreds of applications over six months, has been told by recruiters that there are simply too many applicants for each role. But he also sees the benefit of AI, which now handles 80% of his development work. “While the productivity boost is incredible, it’s also concerning — companies that used to need five developers might only need three now,” he said. “The AI impact on coding made me genuinely unsure about my future in software development, and I really don’t know what my next move will be if the market stays like this,” Stalmakov added. Educators teaching coding and computer science are having to pivot their curriculum to prepare students for a rapidly evolving job market. Magdalena Balazinska, director of the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, said the hiring slowdown is not just because AI is taking coding work. Tech companies are also right-sizing after a Covid-era hiring spree and need to spend wisely amid multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure investments. Balazinska said it’s not all doom and gloom — more than half of the school’s approximately 675 graduates from the 2024-25 school year have already found full-time jobs at companies including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Nonetheless, the school is evolving for the AI era, she said. It’s rolling out a new “AI-assisted software development” course this fall, where students will learn about modern software engineering practices and the role of AI as a tool for that work. Some advanced classes will also allow students to use generative AI, “which is enabling faculty members to raise the level of difficulty and complexity of the projects,” Balazinska said. But introductory courses will still prohibit using AI for classwork — so students learn the basics without relying too much on the technology. “Our philosophy has always been that computer science is a field that advances faster than any other field, so preparing students to advance with the field is the most important thing we can do,” Balazinska said. “There will be jobs for those who learn the latest advances in computing and those with excellent skills and knowledge,” she said. It’s not just universities that are changing their approach. Coding bootcamps — specialized schools often catering to career switchers or students looking to pursue careers in tech without a four-year degree — have adapted, too. The idea of landing a lucrative six-figure salary without a traditional degree, combined with an increased hiring demand from the tech industry, led to a boom in enrollment at these bootcamps throughout the 2010s. But Daniele Grassi, CEO of tech bootcamp General Assembly, said he’s noticed a shift over the past couple of years in the types of customers coming to his school. While General Assembly primarily attracted aspiring software engineers for much of its 14-year existence, the school is now also garnering interest from C-level executives, human resource managers and sales professionals interested in developing their AI skills. As a result, General Assembly has begun creating programs specifically designed to help workers across all tiers of a company —from entry level to the board of directors, whether the roles are technical or not — gain new AI skills, according to Grassi. “Six months ago, or nine months ago … we realized that every role is disrupted,” Grassi told CNN. General Assembly has incorporated AI skills teachings into its programming across disciplines, said Jeffrey Bergin, the school’s chief learning officer, so that everything it offers “now has an AI element.” The school offers courses in data analytics, user experience design, data science and information technology in addition to software engineering. Bergin said the school wants “to make sure folks have what they need, both in being able to apply those skills and to take those skills into job interviews and into employers, and have those really resonate.” Tech leaders say they’ll still need young people with computer science degrees, even if there are fewer jobs to go around. “The thing people study is computer science, which is a lot more than code. It’s understanding how these systems work,” Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon Web Services, told CNN. “The critical thinking part doesn’t change. You still need to be able to think, you need to be creative. I actually think it becomes more important because you have more time” to be creative with AI doing the grunt work. Still, that may be cold comfort to new grads, given Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s recent warning that the company will need fewer human workers in the future as AI takes on more tasks. Beyond big tech, many AI startups are also focused on growing with the smallest teams possible. “The AI boom isn’t following the patterns of past tech cycles,” Kyle Holm, vice president of the compensation advisory group at consulting firm Sequoia, wrote in a blog post last month. “The traditional model of high-growth companies expanding headcount, investing in people teams, and broadly distributing equity isn’t playing out the same way this time.” David Barajas, who has been working as a full-time software engineer for more than a decade, said he would feel “intimidated” by the rise of AI tools in coding if he were a junior engineer. But overall, he’s of the mindset that AI will change the job rather than wipe it out completely — as long as aspiring engineers embrace it, that is. “AI won’t replace you as an engineer,” Barajas said. “An engineer with AI will replace you as an engineer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Following Perfect Dark reboot's cancellation Tomb Raider developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their second round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods. The news comes not too long after the Perfect Dark reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling. Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via LinkedIn post, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition." Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's set to be published by Amazon. Among the former Crystal Dynamics staff who've shared that they're among those laid off are senior animator Jaron Gittleman and senior designer Matthew Angus. "Well it finally happened," Gittleman wrote on LinkedIn. "After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth. I learned so much and worked with some of the best. I'll miss them dearly." Best of luck to all affected.

Tomb Raider remains unaffected. Crystal Dynamics has announced the "difficult decision" to lay off more staff, citing "evolving business conditions". It added the decision was not made lightly, but was necessary to "ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market". In a post shared on LinkedIn, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition". It went on to additionally thank the rest of its team, as well as its community and partners for the "continued support" as the studio builds a "creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together". The next entry in the Tomb Raider series - which is being developed in collaboration with Amazon - is not affected by these most recent layoffs at Crystal Dynamics. This week's layoffs follow the cancellation of Perfect Dark earlier this year by Microsoft. While the reboot was being helmed by The Initiative, Crystal Dynamics was supporting the project. Well this is it. I was let go from Crystal Dynamics as Perfect Dark was cancelled. I am now out of a job. I genuinely dont know what to do at this moment but to frantically apply for as many jobs that are applicable. If anyone needs a Senior Environment Artist of 10+ years, please let me know. The studio previously laid off 17 staff members in March of this year. At this time, Crystal Dynamics said this was "necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success", and was "not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected".

Title: Media & Marketing Financials – August 2025

by Mathew Broughton on 28th Aug 2025 in News With Autumn and ATS London on the horizon, ExchangeWire research lead Mat Broughton takes stock (if you'll pardon the pun) of company financials across the media and marketing ecosystem. A solid quarter overall for our monitored advertising technology companies, however subsequent volatility suggests headwinds for the remainder of the year. As we track to the start of the calendar month, the chart above does not account for the post-results hit to The Trade Desk, which took a near 40% thumping in terms of its share price off of a deceleration in growth. Despite reaping recent rewards with its continued championing of the open web, investors panicked over competition from the likes of Amazon. As summarised by Madison & Wall, “Long-term optimism around the opportunity from the open web for The Trade Desk continues to seem unfounded to us[...] As well uncertainties abound around the mix of revenue trends for the company from data vs. technology fees.” Ouch. This had a knock-on effect on the rest of the sector, with Zeta, MNTN, Magnite, PubMatic and Viant, all seeing share price dips despite solid earnings. Simultaneously, we saw AppLovin continue its meteoric rise, despite ongoing scrutiny as to its practices. If The Trade Desk gets thumped for calling Amazon a potential partner, why does AppLovin avoid the hammer for wholly partnering with Meta whilst simultaneously acting as a parasite? This is all not to forget the latest flop in the flip-flop-flip-flop saga of Google deprecating third-party cookies across its Chrome browser, now deciding that users will no longer be offered the choice to use, or not use, the cookie. Where one door of uncertainty closes, another opens… The big tech and social platforms recorded astounding revenue growth across the board, particularly considering the age of some of these firms. Notably, Meta, Reddit, and Apple all exceeded earnings expectations despite Trump's tariffs and economic slowdown. Twas much of the same for Google parent Alphabet, as its third-party network business continues to stagnate, whilst YouTube goes gangbusters, achieving double-digit growth to reach USD$9.8bn (£7.2bn). Search revenue also continues to climb, bouldering 12% upwards to over USD$54bn (£39.9bn). Google claims that its AI search results monetise at the same rate as traditional search ads, despite these decimating publisher traffic, indicating these generate far fewer clicks, and comparatively showing far fewer ads within its AI Mode. I asked Google AI Mode to clarify:Righto. A highly tumultuous time across the agency landscape, with the public-listed holding groups exposed to the joint gales of AI and upstart independents. In recent months, we’ve seen a frankly aggressive period of client switching, with massive brand accounts switching hands nigh-on every week. Through this turbulence, Omnicom and IPG had a stable quarter ahead of the closure of their blockbuster merger. Further consolidation was seemingly on the cards, with Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4Capital mulling over a merger approach from private equity-backed MSQ Partners, only for the mooted acquirer to come out and say that they had not made an approach, nor would ever do so ever again. Savagery Publicis continues to fly, nabbing accounts aplenty at the expense of its rivals. I’ve used the phrase “mastering the narrative” a lot in recent months regarding Publicis, and they continue to do so, rightfully highlighting that scrutiny will shift onto Omnicom/IPG following the completion of their merger (much to the delight of beleaguered WPP). As industry expert Barry Dudley observed: "having an enemy, a Goliath to your David, is very commonly what drives people, drives businesses. This has been the environment that Publicis has been playing within." A mixed bag among the publisher set, with digital publishers and streaming providers seeing strong gains, whilst traditional linear TV publishers continue to face headwinds. Despite market challenges, UK publishers showed strong momentum, whilst audience targeting, first-party data strategies, and AI integration, all dominated earnings presentations. Consolidation has cooled in the segment, barring the merger between Nextar and Tegna, which seeks to solidify shaky foundations beneath the house of local TV across the US. Despite rampant speculation earlier in the year, gossip has quietened about a potential divestment of ITV Studios from the parent ITV business, however talks may still be ongoing on that front.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Announces Layoffs; New Tomb Raider Game Is Unaffected

A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected. Here's the whole message that was posted on LinkedIn: Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition. To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision. The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was canceled last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft. Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP. In April 2022, we learned that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio announced that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with vague goals to create an interconnected universe that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually air on Prime Video. As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last heard something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Investors are looking at bargains in China, says HSBC investment boss, pushed by AI discounts and fears over Trump 2.0

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. When President Trump returned to the White House his intention was clear: to make America great again. But the United States’ economic partners, and some of its rivals, are also benefiting from having the unorthodox showman back in the Oval Office. Investors are watching the U.S. stock market with both enthusiasm and trepidation: The S&P 500 is up 15% over the past year, Treasuries have remained relatively steady, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expected to begin a downward trajectory. But overlaying the strong fundamentals are questions: Is the soaring growth of Magnificent Seven stocks overvalued on the unfulfilled promises of AI? Will Trump’s unusual foreign policy materially damage the domestic economy? And where might the true winners of the artificial intelligence race emerge from? Increasingly, investors are answering those questions by diversifying into a key region, says Willem Sels, global chief investment officer for HSBC’s global private bank. That region is China. America continues to prove its economic resilience and earnings deliverables, Sels told Fortune in an exclusive interview, but geopolitical uncertainty is pushing investors toward balancing risk with other regions. Traditionally, the question of political influence over portfolios has centered on emerging markets, said Sels, but over the past few years that has moved into developed markets as well. As such, diversification has become more of a focus—particularly for business owners looking to spread risk between the economy they operate in and the assets used to protect their wealth. “When a client comes in the door … the first discussion is, ‘Please build a global portfolio. Maybe try to have as little as possible in your home country if you already have your business here, because that’s diversification,’” Sels said. “Clearly the debate over the last few months was about, Will there be diversification away from the U.S.? And there are a number of elements to that.” Part of the question is how dominant U.S. Big Tech has become in equity markets, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) providing most of the growth. As such, if these stocks hiccup it can have major ramifications for portfolios. “Clearly you potentially need to do something around that … to diversify,” Sels said. “We highlight things like, make sure that you don’t only have the growth stocks but have some value stocks, do some sector diversification, do some geographical diversification, and so on. “The other thing that triggered that diversification discussion obviously was the rapid policy changes in the U.S., and the growth of the debt pile, which led people to ask the question, ‘Is there a de-dollarization story? And what does that mean in terms of my portfolio and other people’s portfolio?’ What we’ve seen in the data is that there have been two months or so where there were some outflows out of bonds and equity markets, but that has not lasted—to a large extent because policy has become a little bit clearer.” “People are adding a little bit to other regions, adding a little bit to other sectors to be less concentrated in the U.S. market, but they are not fleeing away from it,” Sels continued. “There was enthusiasm for European stocks, but it was very short-lived. The Asian investors, over the last 15 [to] 20 years that I’ve been going there, find it very hard to get excited about Europe.” Part of the problem is that these investors don’t see as many new or emerging companies that could materially change the European economy, and there’s also the issue of brand recognition beyond companies like LVMH and BMW, Sels said. “This is the first time that we’re again seeing flows from Europe into China,” Sels added. “That is to a large extent because of the AI trade that people want to play, and then secondly this concept of anti-involution … with the supply-side reforms which would address the issue of overcapacity, therefore the deflation issue and therefore the earnings growth, because what you have in China is a lot of very competitive companies … therefore they have no pressing power, and therefore earnings growth has been reasonably weak.” China has signaled a shift in priorities to address involution, with the country’s Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission telling President Xi Jinping in a meeting last month that Beijing must “focus on key and difficult issues, regulate enterprises’ disorderly and low-price competition,” and “guide enterprises to improve product quality and promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity.” Beijing is no stranger to the issue. In 2015 the government launched similar actions to address overcapacity, particularly in key regions like steel and coal, in order to boost corporate profitability. Flash-forward to 2025 and “they’re now addressing that,” Sels said. “Therefore we think that earnings expectations will go up … One of the main obstacles for our clients had been the belief that [Chinese companies are] over-competing, and therefore your earnings are not there, the economic growth is potentially there, but your earnings are not there. “That’s now changing. So we’re seeing flows back and obviously also encouraged by ‘How can I diversify my big U.S. trunk of assets?’” With discussions about diversification out of the U.S. remaining active, China seems to have emerged as the region to balance that risk, Sels said. And Beijing’s typically lower share prices also offer the category of the moment, AI, at a bargain. In a note published last week, HSBC said that within the AI ecosystem, infrastructure stocks are outperforming enablers and adopters—at 22.2% versus 11.3% and 13.5% since July. Indeed, this week Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies briefly became the country’s most expensive stock, surging 10% on Wednesday to 1,465 yuan ($204.62). At the time of writing, the share price has dropped back but is up 112% for the year to date. And while Cambricon exemplifies the more expensive end of the scale, Sels highlights that other equivalents to U.S. stocks can be found at a “30% to 40% discount.” “We’re basically saying, ‘Listen, don’t just look at the chips makers but also look at the guys that build out the infrastructure around it. The guys that build out the energy, the electricity supply around it, the robotics and automation, where it is not just a matter of, we move the data a little bit—this is real, big innovation.’ And so by diversifying throughout the AI ecosystem, I think you address a little bit of the question about valuations.” China’s stock market is soaring: The SSE Composite Index is up 33.4% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is up 14.9%. While the growth in China is marked, HSBC’s research points out U.S. AI-related capital expenditure (driven by the “Big Four” of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, along with Stargate and other private companies) is surpassing that of China’s “Big Four” (Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, as well as telecom services companies) by eight- to 10-fold. Moreover, HSBC’s research adds: “U.S. firms achieve higher returns on AI capex, with cloud platforms generating significantly more revenue than their Chinese counterparts—close to USD $400 billion in the U.S. vs. USD $60 billion in China in 2024, according to Statista.” So while clients may be balancing against overreliance on American companies, Sels said, the upside fundamentals of the U.S. remain strong—enough to take recession off the table. Indeed, while blips in tech stocks recently led to questions over an AI bubble, the HSBC boss remained bullish: “We certainly think that that AI liftoff is structural in nature.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.

The S&P 500 achieved a record high close ahead of Nvidia's quarterly results, a key event testing the AI rally's valuation. While Nvidia's stock dipped slightly, its significant S&P 500 weighting makes its financial performance crucial. Investors are also monitoring potential interest rate cuts and political developments, including Trump's attempt to replace a Federal Reserve Governor. The S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 127 new highs and 35 new lows.
