Title: Pentagon to become largest shareholder in Rinehart-backed rare earth miner MP Materials

The Defense Department will become the largest shareholder in Gina Rinehart-backed rare earths miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $US400 million ($606m) of its preferred stock. MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the US at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas. Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP’s rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said. Shares of New York-listed MP Materials soared about 50 per cent to close at $US45.23 ($68.59). Its market capitalisation grew to $US7.4 billion ($11.2b), an increase of about $US2.5b ($3.8b) from the previous trading session. Mrs Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, saw her 8.5 per cent holding in MP via Hancock Prospecting add approximately $US211m ($320m) to her net worth overnight. Rare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department. The US was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70 per cent of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the US and China. Ryan Browne Kevin Breuninger Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break US dependence on China. MP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the US. “I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalisation,” Litinsky told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Thursday. “We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We’re shareholder driven.” US miners are facing a unique threat from “Chinese mercantilism,” he said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other US companies, the CEO said. “It’s a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so,” Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $US30.03 ($45.55) a share for 10 years that allows the US to buy additional common stock. Exercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15 per cent stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61 per cent held by Litinsky and the 8.27 per cent held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data. MP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the US to serve defence and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn’t disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tonnes annually. This manufacturing capacity is enough to “meaningfully support US defense and commercial needs,” Mr Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning. Arjun Kharpal The Pentagon has agreed to buy 100 per cent of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1b ($1.5b) to help finance the manufacturing facility. The Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $US110 ($166.86) per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets. If the market price is below $US110 per kilogram, the US will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30 per cent of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials’ second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said. The Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. “The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money,” the CEO said. MP Materials also expects to receive a $US150m ($227m) loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Title: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale Dominate Crypto ETF Assets Amidst Institutional Interest

The firms’ offerings made up 85% of all crypto AUM, while separate research found 75% of investors expect cryptocurrency to soon become part of institutional allocations. Institutional investors expect cryptocurrency to become more prevalent in institutional portfolios and expect traditional financial institutions to dramatically increase their launches of digital asset funds in the near future. According to London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management Ltd., which partnered with research firm Pureprofile to interview 200 institutional investors and wealth managers for the project, 75% of respondents said they expect cryptocurrencies to become a part of institutional portfolio asset allocation within the next five years. Cryptocurrency ETFs are often used by institutional asset owners that seek exposure to the digital asset class. These offerings are dominated by three firms, according to research from ISS Market Intelligence, which, like CIO, is owned by ISS STOXX. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Grayscale Investments manage more than 85% of all crypto ETF assets under management, totaling approximately $123 billion, ISS MI reported. Fidelity offers exposure to bitcoin and ether through its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and its Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Grayscale offers exposure through four different funds.

The Nickel Digital survey also found that 66% of respondents said they see cryptocurrency as the asset class with the biggest opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next five years, followed by private equity and emerging market equities at 64% and 61%, respectively. These investors expect more “traditional financial institutions” to launch crypto funds over the next two years, with 43% saying there will be a dramatic increase and 53% anticipating a slight increase. “Traditional finance firms are already making significant strides into the digital assets space and that is only predicted to increase over the next two years,” said Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founding partner in Nickel Digital, in a statement. “The views of institutional investors and wealth managers on the ability of crypto to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns helps to explain why that is the case, and why professional investors increasingly expect crypto to be part of institutional investors portfolio allocation.” The Trump administration includes a slate of regulators who are proponents of digital assets, including Jonathan Gould, an attorney who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. After serving the first Trump administration, he was chief legal officer at Bitfury Group, a provider of crypto mining equipment and related services. Additional belief that interest in digital assets also follows the Senate’s passage of the landmark GENIUS Act, setting the stage for the enactment of the first federal framework for stablecoins. The House is scheduled to vote on the measure next week.

Jensen Huang’s wealth could soon overtake famed investor Warren Buffett’s, after Nvidia's rising stock earlier this week made the AI chipmaker the most valuable company in history. Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday became the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion when its stock briefly climbed above $163.93. The shares added another 0.8% Thursday to close just above $164, a record, leaving them 21% higher for 2025 and up roughly 1,400% over the past 5 years. Huang, Nvidia's CEO, owns about 3.5% of the AI boom's poster child. He's seen his net worth climb to an estimated $142 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, rising $2.47 billion yesterday alone, and swelling over $27 billion since the start of the year. This week’s gains have made Huang the 10th richest person in the world in Bloomberg’s ranking, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) CEO and "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett at an estimated $144 billion. At that level, it wouldn't take much for Huang's wealth to overtake Buffett's. Wall Street's analysts are largely bullish on Nvidia's potential for more gains, with a mean target near $175 compiled by Visible Alpha. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the stock's gains and Huang's net worth.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Three Big Things This Week: Jason’s Directness: “It will be the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI is just the inability to recruit talent… If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things like just shut the startup down.” The AI talent war will separate winners from losers more brutally than any previous technology cycle. Rory’s Reality: “The truth is there’s a small number of things that are working really well, and everything else looks dull in comparison… So if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it’s very hard to catch up.” Market dynamics now favor extreme concentration of success, making early leads nearly insurmountable. Harry’s Honesty: “If you don’t want to embrace [AI], you are going to make this ship sink… If you need a week for rediscovery week, I promise you, you’re not going to work.” The AI adoption window has closed – adapt immediately or become irrelevant. The venture capital and SaaS landscape is experiencing seismic shifts that will fundamentally reshape how companies compete, hire, and operate. In the latest episode of the 20VC podcast, three industry leaders dissected the most critical developments defining 2025’s market dynamics. The business world was stunned when Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman, two of Silicon Valley’s most respected figures, abandoned their $1.1 billion venture fund NFDG to join Meta. The mathematics behind this decision reveal the extraordinary economics reshaping the industry. According to the podcast analysis, NFDG had deployed roughly $500 million of their fund and achieved a 4x return in just two years – generating approximately $1.5 billion in gains and $300 million in carried interest for the partners. Despite this stellar performance, Meta’s offer was compelling enough to walk away from an additional $1.5 billion in investable capital. NFDG: The $1.1B VC Fund That 4X’d in Two Years—Then Got Acquired by Meta The Strategic Implications This wasn’t just an acqui-hire; it represents Meta’s systematic approach to building an “AI talent magnet.” As Jason Lemkin noted, “The best want to work for the best… and the tough thing is they want to work for the prominent best in many cases.” Meta’s strategy mirrors what worked at X (formerly Twitter) under Elon Musk – creating a “mega mecca for talent” that attracts top performers who refuse to settle for anything less than excellence. This approach is becoming essential because, as the speakers emphasized, struggling companies can’t attract great talent regardless of their growth metrics. Perhaps the most sobering discussion centered on the emerging talent crisis in B2B AI. The numbers are staggering: companies are now offering $800,000+ annual packages plus RSUs and guarantees to secure top AI engineering talent. One founder shared that he’s giving away 0.5-1% equity stakes to each AI engineer – unsustainable math at scale. The success of companies like Cursor is creating ripple effects throughout the industry. As one multi-billion dollar company founder told Lemkin, “My single biggest challenge today is cursor… they’re just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” This creates an existential question for SaaS companies: How do you compete when you can’t afford the talent war? The speakers identified several harsh realities: One of the most fascinating discussions revealed how dramatically investor expectations have shifted. The traditional SaaS growth trajectory of “triple, triple, double, double” (tripling revenue for two years, then doubling for two years) is no longer exciting in today’s market. Why Traditional SaaS Metrics Are Losing Their Luster Rory O’Driscoll explained the new mathematics: “If there’s two games and one of them has that embedded 10% chance of amazing, like 20 billion, a cursor outcome, and one of them just doesn’t… there’s no price at which you’ll do it.” This creates a painful reality for solid, profitable SaaS companies growing at 20-25% annually. They’re caught in a valley between: The Toma Bravo acquisition of Olo (a profitable, $320M ARR company) for $2 billion at 6.5x revenue exemplifies this dynamic. It’s a “meat and potatoes deal” that provides decent returns but doesn’t generate life-changing wealth for investors. OpenAI’s revelation that stock-based compensation exceeded 119% of revenue last year highlights a critical issue facing high-growth companies. While the accounting can be misleading (based on 409A valuations rather than actual dilution), the trend signals dangerous territory for many startups. The Churchill Principle As Jason Lemkin eloquently put it: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” This philosophy is driving companies to prioritize market dominance over financial efficiency, leading to unsustainable compensation inflation that will impact venture returns for years. CoreWeave’s $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific demonstrates sophisticated use of inflated stock prices. By converting rental expenses into equity dilution, they’ve reduced fixed costs while maintaining upside exposure to data center demand. This move shows how companies with high-multiple stocks can strategically de-risk their business models. Canva’s “AI Discovery Week” – requiring all 5,000 employees to pause regular work and learn AI – represents a gentler approach to what many see as an inevitable reckoning. The speakers were divided on this approach: The underlying message is clear: companies can’t afford to carry employees who resist AI adoption. The podcast’s analysis of recession probabilities and market dynamics revealed sophisticated thinking about current risks: The discussion reveals several critical strategic imperatives: Perhaps most sobering was the discussion of venture capital’s current challenges. Deal volume has hit an eight-year low while spectacular successes capture all attention and capital. This creates a “flight to consensus” where: The speakers agreed that most VCs are spending their time managing disappointing portfolio companies from 2020-2021 that are growing at 10-30% rather than the explosive rates initially projected. The conversation painted a picture of an industry in transition, where traditional rules no longer apply: The overarching theme is clear: we’re witnessing the emergence of a two-tier market where AI-enabled companies with top talent operate in a different league from traditional businesses. For SaaS leaders, the choice is stark – transform or risk irrelevance in an increasingly AI-driven world. Jason on talent reality: “I was with the founder this morning of a multi-billion dollar company… they said my single biggest challenge today is cursor… cursor’s just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” Harry on employee expectations: “If you need a discovery week for AI, you have people who aren’t curious enough to want to progress and running their job… I said you fire them.” Rory on the Churchill principle: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” Rory on recession probability: “Booms don’t die of old age… just because it’s been great for six or seven years doesn’t mean that it has to die in the eight.” Companies that act decisively on talent, AI adoption, and strategic positioning will thrive, while those clinging to old playbooks risk being left behind in what promises to be the most transformative period in business software history.

That distinction could become more important, as firms’ experimentation with security-based tokens potentially leaves investors confused—a concern raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. A stock that’s natively tokenized on Ethereum, for example, would carry the same set entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, like voting or dividend rights, Domingo said. Natively tokenized assets also have no counterparty risk, while avoiding any fragmentation issues, he added. BlackRock’s $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which Securitize helped introduce last year, is natively tokenized because, as the asset manager’s transfer agent, the firm manages and records the fund’s shares directly on-chain, Domingo explained. Transfer agents usually use proprietary databases instead of a blockchain. “The token represents 100% of the security,” Domingo said, pointing to crypto software platform Exodus’ stock as another example. “One token represents one share.” Exodus shares began trading as tokens on Securitize’s platform in 2022, but this year, interest in tokenization has renewed, with Robinhood unveiling tokenized stock trading on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum last month, and Kraken pushing xStocks on Solana and other networks like BNB Chain. In a statement on Tuesday, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce recommended that firms structuring tokenized offerings, given their obligation to adhere to federal securities laws, should consider meeting with the regulator. Tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations, she underscored. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she wrote. “Tokenized securities are still securities.” Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at Seward and Kissel LLP who leads the firm’s blockchain and digital assets practice, told Decrypt that the conversation around tokenization pertains to crypto, but at the end of the day, it’s about policing securities under existing securities laws. “People sometimes feel that, because of the nature of the blockchain, crypto should be less regulated,” he said. “That’s not what we’re talking about here.” In some ways, Peirce’s statement represented a warning to investors, not long after ChatGPT maker OpenAI denounced Robinhood’s move to offer so-called stock tokens in Europe that are tied to equity in the tech darling. In response, Robinhood said its tokens give "indirect exposure to private markets” as “tokenized contracts that follow their price.” Indeed, Pierce said in her recent statement that a tokenized security, depending on the circumstances, could resemble “security entitlements” or a “security-based swap,” as opposed to equity in any private or public company. Robinhood’s stock tokens possess some features that appear aimed at creating a controlled environment for the product. U.S. customers are barred from buying stock tokens, they can’t be sent to other wallets or platforms, and users must be KYC-verified via identifying information. Kraken doesn’t allow U.S. customers to purchase xStocks either, but the tokens, which are issued by a firm called Backed, are permissionless, meaning that they can be freely traded on a decentralized exchange or independently adopted by any platform. As the SEC urges market participants to consider federal securities, the regulator is trying to stick to a collaborative approach to crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, as reflected by a roundtable discussion on tokenization hosted by the SEC in May. “In recent history, we seem to have forgotten a very fundamental concept: that investors and issuers have valuable observations and experiences,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and now-defunct crypto exchange FTX once dabbled in tokenized stock trading—but those products were ultimately shelved. Crypto lending platform Abra began offering contracts as tokens to customers in 2019 that allowed them to gain exposure to price moments of certain U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. The company “voluntarily ceased offering” the tokens after cooperating with an SEC investigation, according to a CFTC filing. In 2020, the SEC and CFTC ordered Abra to pay each agency a $150,000 penalty for allegedly offering unregistered securities and engaging in unlawful off-exchange swaps trading. Abra agreed, “without admitting or denying the findings.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Share this article Aptos Labs, the development team behind the Aptos layer 1 blockchain, has appointed Solomon Tesfaye as its new Chief Business Officer, strengthening its executive team at a time of rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional blockchain adoption. Tesfaye previously served as Head of Capital Markets at Aptos, where he led efforts to connect the blockchain to traditional financial players. His leadership enabled Aptos to build partnerships with institutions including BlackRock, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, helping to position the network for deployment in crypto ETPs and ETFs in both the US and Europe. “Solomon has been critical in shaping our Global Trading Engine vision and forging the partnerships that will help make it a reality,” said Avery Ching, Co-Founder and CEO at Aptos Labs. “As CBO, he’ll be key to scaling that work, bringing more institutions, markets, and real-world use cases onto Aptos as global web3 adoption continues to accelerate.” With more than a decade’s experience in investment banking, venture capital, and digital asset strategy, Tesfaye is expected to lead Aptos Labs’ push into financial services infrastructure, institutional onboarding, and scalable tokenization. His focus will include driving global enterprise partnerships in fintech, payments, and asset management, advancing strategic initiatives and business development, opening new markets and use cases for on-chain finance. Aptos is expected to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, which promise improved regulatory clarity and enhanced support for crypto businesses. “With the US nearing the completion of frameworks for next-generation financial services, Aptos Labs is well-positioned to lead the shift to on-chain assets and help shape the infrastructure of tomorrow’s global markets,” said Tesfaye in a statement. “I’m excited to forge the partnerships and integrations that institutions and other market participants need to fully harness Aptos’ tokenization capabilities at scale.” The leadership change comes amid accelerating adoption, as Aptos surpasses $540 million in tokenized real-world assets, with institutional integrations having doubled since the start of 2025.

Title: AMD's Latest AI Chips Are on Par With Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, HSBC Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amd-s-latest-ai-chips-are-on-par-with-nvidia-s-blackwell-gpus-hsbc-says-11769625

The performance of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) latest AI chips is on par with those from Silicon Valley rival Nvidia's (NVDA), HSBC analysts said. In a note Thursday, HSBC analysts upgraded their rating on AMD to a “buy” from a “hold” and doubled their price target to $200, noting that AMD's latest series of chips can compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. AMD launched its Instinct MI350 Series GPUs last month, claiming the chips offered four times more computing power than its previous generation. “With the recent launch of the MI350 series, we were pleasantly surprised with the performance upgrades which imply that the MI350 series can compete with Nvidia latest-gen HGX B200 AI GPU,” HSBC analysts wrote. "Owing to the performance enhancements, the pricing premium is much higher than expected earlier which could help drive upside to earnings in 2025 and 2026." The analysts, led by Frank Lee, also wrote that there was further upside possible for AMD shares when the chipmaker launches its MI400 series next year, which could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform—scheduled for the second half of 2026. AMD unveiled the MI400 last month in an event hosted by CEO Lisa Su and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which has signed on as a customer for the next-gen chips. AMD shares are rising more than 4% to $144 in early Thursday trading, having gained around a fifth of their value this year. Shares in Nvidia, which briefly became the world’s most valuable company with an over $4 trillion market cap Wednesday, are little changed.

Title: EFF's Guide to Getting Records About Axon's Draft One AI-Generated Police Reports
URL: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/effs-guide-getting-records-about-axons-ai-generated-police-reports
Time Published: 2025-07-10T16:00:24Z
Full Content:
The moment Axon Enterprise announced a new product, Draft One, that would allow law enforcement officers to use artificial intelligence to automatically generate incident report narratives based on body-worn camera audio, everyone in the police accountability community immediately started asking the same questions. What do AI-generated police reports look like? What kind of paper trail does this system leave? How do we get a hold of documentation using public records laws? Unfortunately, obtaining these records isn't easy. In many cases, it's straight-up impossible. Read our full report on how Axon's Draft One defies transparency expectations by design here. In some jurisdictions, the documents are walled off behind government-created barriers. For example, California fully exempts police narrative reports from public disclosure, while other states charge fees to access individual reports that become astronomical if you want to analyze the output in bulk. Then there are technical barriers: Axon's product itself does not allow agencies to isolate reports that contain an AI-generated narrative, although an agency can voluntarily institute measures to make them searchable by a keyword. This spring, EFF tested out different public records request templates and sent them to dozens of law enforcement agencies we believed are using Draft One. We asked each agency for the Draft One-generated police reports themselves, knowing that in most cases this would be a long shot. We also dug into Axon's user manuals to figure out what kind of logs are generated and how to carefully phrase our public records request to get them. We asked for the current system settings for Draft One, since there are a lot of levers police administrators can pull that drastically change how and when officers can use the software. We also requested the standard records that we usually ask for when researching new technologies: procurement documents, agreements, training manuals, policies, and emails with vendors. Like all mass public records campaigns, the results were… mixed. Some agencies were refreshingly open with their records. Others assessed us records fees well outside the usual range for a non-profit organization. What we learned about the process is worth sharing. Axon has thousands of clients nationwide that use its Tasers, body-worn cameras and bundles of surveillance equipment, and the company is using those existing relationships to heavily promote Draft One. We expect many more cities to deploy the technology over the next few years. Watchdogging police use of AI will require a nationwide effort by journalists, advocacy organizations and community volunteers. Below we’re sharing some sample language you can use in your own public records requests about Draft One — but be warned. It’s likely that the more you include, the longer it might take and the higher the fees will get. The template language and our suggestions for filing public records requests are not legal advice. If you have specific questions about a public records request you filed, consult a lawyer. Language to try in your public records request: Or If you are curious about a particular officer's Draft One usage, you can also ask for their reports specifically. However it may be helpful to obtain their usage log first (see section 2). We suggest using weeks, not months, because the sheer number of reports can get costly very quickly. As an add-on to Axon's evidence and records management platforms, Draft One uses ChatGPT to convert audio taken from Axon body-worn cameras into the so-called first draft of the narrative portion of a police report. When Politico surveyed seven agencies in September 2024, reporter Alfred Ng found that police administrators did not have the technical ability to identify which reports contained AI-generated language. As Ng reported. “There is no way for us to search for these on our end,” a Lafayette, IN police captain told Ng. Six months later, EFF received the same no-can-do response from the Lafayette Police Department. Although Lafayette Police could not create a list on their own, it turns out that Axon's engineers can generate these reports for police if asked. When the Frederick Police Department in Colorado received a similar request from Ng, the agency contacted Axon for help. The company does internally track reports written with Draft One and was able to provide a spreadsheet of Draft One reports (.csv) and even provided Frederick Police with computer code to allow the agency to create similar lists in the future. Axon told them they would look at making this a feature in the future, but that appears not to have happened yet. But we also struck gold with two agencies: the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBCSO) in Florida and the Lake Havasu City Police Department in Arizona. In both cases, the agencies require officers to include a disclosure that they used Draft One at the end of the police narrative. Here's a slide from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Draft One training: And here's the boilerplate disclosure: I acknowledge this report was generated from a digital recording using Draft One by Axon. I further acknowledge that I have I reviewed the report, made any necessary edits, and believe it to be an accurate representation of my recollection of the reported events. I am willing to testify to the accuracy of this report. As small a gesture as it may seem, that disclosure makes all the difference when it comes to responding to a public records request. Lafayette Police could not isolate the reports because its policy does not require the disclosure. A Frederick Police Department sergeant noted in an email to Axon that they could isolate reports when the auto-disclosure was turned on, but not after they decided to turn it off. This year, Utah legislators introduced a bill to require this kind of disclosure on AI-generated reports. As the PBCSO records manager told us: "We are able to do a keyword and a timeframe search. I used the words ‘Draft One’ and the system generated all the Draft One reports for that timeframe." In fact, in Palm Beach County and Lake Havasu, records administrators dug up huge numbers of records. But, once we saw the estimated price tag, we ultimately narrowed our request to just 10 reports. Here is an example of a report from PBCSO, which only allows Draft One to be used in incidents that don't involve a criminal charge. As a result, many of the reports were related to mental health or domestic dispute responses. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. And here is an example from the Lake Havasu City Police Department, whose clerk was kind enough to provide us with a diverse sample of requests. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. EFF redacted some of these records to protect the identity of members of the public who were captured on body-worn cameras. Black-bar redactions were made by the agencies, while bars with X's were made by us. You can view all the examples we received below: We also received police reports (perhaps unintentionally) from two other agencies that were contained as email attachments in response to another part of our request (see section 7). Language to try in your public records request: Note: You can save time by determining in advance whether the agency uses Axon Evidence or Axon Records and Standards, then choose the applicable option below. If you don't know, you can always request both. Audit logs from Axon Evidence Or Audit logs from Axon Records and Axon Standards You could also tell the agency you are only interested in Draft One related items, which may save the agency time in reviewing and redacting the documents. Generally, many of the basic actions a police officer takes using Axon technology — whether it's signing in, changing a password, accessing evidence or uploading BWC footage — is logged in the system. This also includes some actions when an officer uses Draft One. However, the system only logs three types of activities: requesting that Draft One generate a report, signing a Draft One liability disclosure, or changing Draft One's settings. And these reports are one of the only ways to identify which reports were written with AI and how widely the technology is used. Unfortunately, Axon appears to have designed its system so that administrators cannot create a list of all Draft One activities taken by the entire police force. Instead, all they can do is view an individual officer's audit log to see when they used Draft One or look at the log for a particular piece of evidence to see if Draft One was used. These can be exported as a spreadsheet or a PDF. (When the Frederick Police Department asked Axon how to create a list of Draft One reports, the Axon rep told them that feature wasn't available and they would have to follow the above method. "To set expectations, it’s not going to be graceful, but this wasn’t a scenario we anticipated needing to make easy," Axon wrote in August 2024, then suggested it might come up with a long-term solution. We emailed Axon back in March to see if this was still the case, but they did not provide a response.) Here's an excerpt from a PDF version from the Bishop Police Department in California: Here are some additional audit log examples: If you know the name of an individual officer, you can try to request their audit logs to see if they used Draft One. Since we didn't have a particular officer in mind, we had to get creative. An agency may manage their documents with one of a few different Axon offerings: Axon Evidence, Axon Records, or Axon Standards. The process for requesting records is slightly different depending on which one is used. We dug through the user manuals and came up with a few ways to export a random(ish) example. We also linked the manuals and gave clear instructions for the records officers. With Axon Evidence, an administrator can simply sort the system to show the 10 most recent users then export their usage logs. With Axon Records/Standard, the administrator has to start typing in a name and then it auto-populates with suggestions. So, we ask them to export the audit logs for the first few users who came up when they typed the letters M, J, and S into the search (since those letters are common at the beginning of names). Unfortunately, this method is a little bit of a gamble. Many officers still aren't using Draft One, so you may end up with hundreds of pages of logs that don't mention Draft One at all (as was the case with the records we received from Monroe County, NY). Language to try in your public records request: We knew the Draft One system offers department managers the option to customize how it can be used, including the categories of crime for which reports can be generated and whether or not there is a disclaimer automatically added to the bottom of the report disclosing the use of AI in its generation. So we asked for a copy of these settings and configurations. In some cases, agencies claimed this was exempted from their public records laws, while other agencies did provide the information. Here is an example from the Campbell Police Department in California: (It's worth noting that while Campbell does require each police report to contain a disclosure that Draft One was used, the California Public Records Act exempts police reports from being released.) Examples of settings: Language to try in your public records request: It can be helpful to know how much Draft One costs, how many user licenses the agency paid for, and what the terms of the agreement are. That information is often contained in records related to the contracting process. Agencies will often provide these records with minimal pushback or redactions. Many of these records may already be online, so a requester can save time and effort by looking around first. These are often found in city council agenda packets. Also, law enforcement agencies often will bump these requests to the city or county clerk instead. Here's an excerpt from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office in New York: These kinds of procurement records describe the nature and cost of the relationship between the police department and the company. They can be very helpful for understanding how much a continuing service subscription will cost and what else was bundled in as part of the purchase. Draft One, so far, is often accessed as an additional feature along with other Axon products. We received too many documents to list them all, but here is a representative example of some of the other documents you might receive, courtesy of the Dacono Police Department in Colorado. All training materials relevant to Draft One or Axon Narrative Assistant generated by this agency, including but not limited to: In addition to seeing when Draft One was used and how it was acquired, it can be helpful to know what rules officers must follow, what directions they're given for using it, and what features are available to users. That's where manuals, policies and training materials come in handy. User manuals are typically going to come from Axon itself. In general, if you can get your hands on one, this will help you to better understand the mechanisms of the system, and it will help you align the way you craft your request with the way the system actually works. Luckily, Axon has published many of the materials online and we've already obtained the user manual from multiple agencies. However, Axon does update the manual from time to time, so it can be helpful to know which version the agency is working from. Here's one from December 2024: Dacono Police Department - Axon Draft One User Guide Policies are internal police department guidance for using Draft One. Not all agencies have developed a policy, but the ones they do have may reveal useful information, such as other records you might be able to request. Here are some examples: Training and user manuals also might reveal crucial information about how the technology is used. In some cases these documents are provided by Axon to the customer. These records may illuminate the specific direction that departments are emphasizing about using the product. Here are a few examples of training presentations: Language to try in your public records request: Many departments are getting access to Draft One as part of a trial or pilot program. The outcome of those experiments with the product can be eye-opening or eyebrow-raising. There might also be additional data or a formal report that reviews what the department was hoping to get from the experience, how they structured any evaluation of its time-saving value for the department, and other details about how officers did or did not use Draft One. Here are some examples we received: Language to try in your public records request: • All communications sent or received by any representative of this agency with individuals representing Axon referencing the following term, including emails and attachments: • All communications sent to or received by any representative of this agency with each of the following email addresses, including attachments: Note: We are not including the specific email addresses here that we used, since they are subject to change when employees are hired, promoted, or find new gigs. However, you can find the emails we used in our requests on MuckRock. The communications we wanted were primarily the emails between Axon and the law enforcement agency. As you can imagine, these emails could reveal the back-and-forth between the company and its potential customers, and these conversations could include the marketing pitch made to the department, the questions and problems police may have had with it, and more. In some cases, these emails reveal cozy relationships between salespeople and law enforcement officials. Take, for example, this email exchange between the Dickinson Police Department and an Axon rep: Or this email between a Frederick Police Department sergeant and an Axon representative, in which a sergeant describes himself as "doing sales" for Axon by providing demos to other agencies. A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Emails like this also show what other agencies are considering using Draft One in the future. For example, in this email we received from the Campbell Police Department shows that the San Francisco Police Department was testing Draft One as early as October 2024 (the usage was confirmed in June 2025 by the San Francisco Standard). A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Your mileage will certainly vary for these email requests, in part because the ability for agencies to search their communications can vary. Some agencies can search by a keyword like "Draft One” or "Axon" and while other agencies can only search by the specific email address. Communications can be one of the more expensive parts of the request. We've found that adding a date range and key terms or email addresses has helped limit these costs and made our requests a bit clearer for the agency. Axon sends a lot of automated emails to its subscribers, so the agency may quote a large fee for hundreds or thousands of emails that aren't particularly interesting. Many agencies respond positively if a requester reaches out to say they're open to narrowing or focusing their request. One of the big questions is how do the Draft One-generated reports compare to the BWC audio the narrative is based on? Are the reports accurate? Are they twisting people's words? Does Draft One hallucinate? Finding these answers requires both obtaining the police report and the footage of the incident that was fed into the system. The laws and process for obtaining BWC footage vary dramatically state to state, and even department to department. Depending on where you live, it can also get expensive very quickly, since some states allow agencies to charge you not only for the footage but the time it takes to redact the footage. So before requesting footage, read up on your state’s public access laws or consult a lawyer. However, once you have a copy of a Draft One report, you should have enough information to file a follow-up request for the BWC footage. So far, EFF has not requested BWC footage. In addition to the aforementioned financial and legal hurdles, the footage can implicate both individual privacy and transparency regarding police activity. As an organization that advocates for both, we want to make sure we get this balance right. Afterall, BWCs are a surveillance technology that collects intelligence on suspects, victims, witnesses, and random passersby. When the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office gave us an AI-generated account of a teenager being hospitalized for suicidal ideations, we of course felt that the minor's privacy outweighed our interest in evaluating the AI. But do we feel the same way about a Draft One-generated narrative about a spring break brawl in Lake Havasu? Ultimately, we may try to obtain a limited amount of BWC footage, but we also recognize that we shouldn't make the public wait while we work it out for ourselves. Accountability requires different methods, different expertise, and different interests, and with this guide we hope to not only shine light on Draft One, but to provide the schematics for others–including academics, journalists, and local advocates–to build their own spotlights to expose police use of this problematic technology. Despite the variation in how agencies responded, we did have some requests that proved fruitful. You can find these requests and the documents we got via the linked police department names below. Please note that we filed two different types of requests, so not all the elements above may be represented in each link.

Title: Wall Street’s advice after Nvidia hits historic $4 trillion market cap: BUY

Paolo Confino is a reporter on Fortune’s global news desk where he covers each day’s most important stories. Wall Street is betting Nvidia can make stock market history again. After the chipmaker powered its way to a $4 trillion valuation, the first company to ever reach the milestone, analysts still see room for the stock to grow. The upside for Nvidia, according to its biggest bulls, remains incomplete. There are more returns to be had, they argue. Nvidia is one of the most beloved stocks by investors. It seems to have ridden the stock market exuberance of AI more than any other company. Investors continue to reiterate its strength as the purveyor of the best AI chips that hyperscalers like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon use. Of the 79 analysts who currently follow Nvidia, 69 rate it a buy, according to Bloomberg. That’s good for an 87% buy rating among analysts. Only 11 rate it a hold. And just one lone holdout lists it as a sell. On Thursday, after Nvidia hit the $4 trillion mark, some analysts were unfazed at the prospect that perhaps the chipmaker had reached its stock market peak. At least three analysts published new reports rating the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, Keybanc Capital Markets, and Bocom International, the subsidiary of Hong Kong’s Bank of Communications, all listed Nvidia as either a buy or an overweight. Their price targets ranged from $175 to $190, implying growth of between 8.1% and 17.4% for Nvidia stock from the $161.84 per share at the time of publication. Despite Nvidia’s valuation, its fundamentals don’t point to an expensive or overpriced stock, according to Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at 17 Asset Management. “The stock has come far, but sales, earnings, and cash flows have come farther,” he told Fortune. Indeed, Nvidia has delivered outstanding financial performance. Its latest quarterly earnings saw it bringing $44 billion in revenue, a 69% increase from the prior year, according to company filings. Its margins remain plump, coming in at 60% over the same quarter. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $111 billion in total assets compared to $32 billion in total liabilities in its 2025 fiscal year. Goldman was undeterred by Nvidia’s recent record valuation. It called worries about Nvidia’s sky-high price “peak concerns” in an analyst note published on Thursday. “We believe Nvidia will remain the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout,” Goldman semiconductor analyst James Schneider wrote. Analysts built their bull case for Nvidia around the fact that it remains the market leader in all the components used to develop AI systems and that the market for all of those products will only grow over the next few years. Nvidia has also spent the last couple years diversifying its offerings. “Nvidia’s well beyond the chips,” Meeks said. The company also has a suite of software and networking gear used for things like gaming and developing robotics. Nvidia’s believers also often point to early signs that AI companies are finally starting to monetize the technology. Once that happens, demand for Nvidia’s products will only grow. AI firms have already started to push further into the consumer tech market. Perplexity released an AI-powered web browser and OpenAI is slated to launch one soon. Major cloud service providers like Amazon and Alphabet will also start to incorporate more AI tech into their services which will only further boost Nvidia’s sales, according to longtime tech bull Dan Ives. “The impact of the AI cycle on consumer Internet will be massive and it will start with the cloud service divisions,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “[Amazon and Alphabet] acquire AI-capable chips, build AI-capable service offerings, and sell those services into their respective installed bases.” But Nvidia’s fate is ultimately linked to that of its biggest customers. As they continue to spend, the stock will continue to soar. The day that they pull back their billions in AI investments is the day Nvidia’s gets “crushed,” Meeks said. “Only thing that would cause a bloodletting here is if we got a sense that major AI spenders pull back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Airbnb Host Refuses To Let Renters Stay In The Unit They Reserved, So They Complain To Airbnb Who Kicks The Host Off The App

by Jayne Elliott Shutterstock/Reddit It used to be that if you wanted to travel somewhere and needed a place to stay, you had to stay in a hotel, but websites like Airbnb have changed that. Now, there are a lot more options! The problem with sites like Airbnb is that not all rentals and not all rental hosts are created equal. I’ve used Airbnb multiple times and had great experiences, but there have been a couple times I thought, “I’ll never stay there again!” Thankfully, I’ve never had an experience as bad as the guy who wrote this story. His experience is so bad that he had to complain to Airbnb about it multiple times to gets the problem resolved, but in the end, it did get resolved in everyone’s favor except the Airbnb host! Let’s see what happens. In around 2019 I had a friend coming to visit for Paddy’s Day. Now I’m Irish, but he’s actually from Hong Kong. Given that I’m local, I said I’d take care of booking accommodation etc. I went on and of course as usual everything was like half a grand (welcome to Dublin…). Obviously things were maxed out due to it being Paddy’s Weekend. But I found one spot in Blackrock, which isn’t in the city centre but is only a few stops away on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit), that was going for €68 per night! I booked it right then and there. Then something weird happened. The following morning I got a notification from AirBNB saying the host wanted to up the price by €288.28, and if I would accept that. I clicked no and figured hey, he’s already accepted our booking, I don’t have to say yes to this! I waited the few weeks until the weekend in question, and then it came. My friend landed at Dublin Airport, we made our way to Blackrock, got to the door, rang the doorbell, and… nothing. This is even weirder. There was no car in the driveway, nobody was home. We hung around for forty minutes until the host arrived, and he wouldn’t. Even. Look us in the eye. I said hi, we’ve a booking to stay here this weekend? And he mumbled something about how no one was staying there sorry and he went inside. Airbnb tried to make it right. Well I got straight onto AirBNB. They offered us our money back, and I said no, that’s not good enough, everywhere else is half a grand what are we going to do with €68? So they offered us double, and I still said no, we need a place to stay! So they booked us into a lovely house elsewhere that was closer to the city centre. It gets even better! But that’s not all. I made an official complaint about the host and how he screwed us over, and they booted him off the app! For trying to fleece a couple of twenty-something lads, he had to stop renting his place out entirely! I’m a petty guy, so every couple of months I randomly think about this and check to see if he’s back online yet. As of May 2025, he’s still not. So I’ve cost him over six years of AirBNB rent (and counting). You love to see it. That Airbnb host really should’ve just let the guys rent the place for the agreed upon price. Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story. Here’s the perspective of someone who hasn’t used Airbnb. A former Airbnb host shares hatred for the service. This person finds the request to pay more pretty unusual. It’s possible the host listed the unit somewhere else. Or maybe the host sold the rental. At least Airbnb made it right for the renter. That’s something. If you liked that post, check out this post about a woman who tracked down a contractor who tried to vanish without a trace.

Title: Meta is trying to win the AI race with money — but not everyone can be bought

﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. ﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. Month after month, message after message, the AI engineer was hearing from Meta recruiters. The recruiters were pestering him to leave his employer and switch over to support the company’s AI efforts, and they were offering a sizable salary package to do so. But he wasn’t so sure. The engineer, who works for a startup that was acquired by a leading AI company and requested anonymity from The Verge, said he had heard from friends that the company expected a lot of personal sacrifices in exchange for its high salaries, whether on employees’ value systems when it comes to Al or work-life balance. Engineers there, he heard, were working around the clock to catch up with rival companies like OpenAl, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft. With so many firms desperately scrambling for AI talent, Meta was offering between $1–1.4 million in total annual compensation (which is typically measured as a combination of salary, annual bonus, and amortized stock value) for many AI roles. But, he suspected, its offers might be less generous than they sounded — tied heavily to subjective performance metrics that could be weaponized against employees. And just as importantly, he wasn’t willing to give up a semblance of work-life balance and a healthy work environment to make a few hundred thousand dollars more. He didn’t pursue the opportunity. In recent months, Meta has launched on an AI hiring spree after making its largest-ever external investment: a $14.3 billion acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Scale AI, an industry giant that provides training data to fuel the technology of companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. As part of the deal, Meta spun up a brand-new superintelligence lab led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang — and to staff the lab, it started poaching. Meta has reportedly poached as many as 10 of OpenAI’s top researchers and model developers, with some pay packages reportedly adding up to $300 million over four years, including equity. (Meta disputes this figure.) It’s also approached a slew of other top AI talent across the industry. Ruoming Pang, who heads up Apple’s foundation AI models team, reportedly departed for Meta, and at least two Anthropic employees and two DeepMind employees have reportedly joined the team as well. The goal is to secure Meta’s spot in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI: a hypothetical AI system that equals or surpasses human cognitive abilities, and the moving target that almost every AI company is currently chasing at breakneck speed. Meta’s primary weapon is vast amounts of money. But some sources across the AI industry question whether that will be enough. Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to make up for lost ground in the AI race, having spent years and significant resources over-indexing on the metaverse while competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested billions in AI startups and signed cloud contracts and other deals. The company’s Llama AI models often rank low on publicly maintained performance leaderboards; at time of writing, Meta’s first appearance on one such leaderboard, Chatbot Arena, was at No. 30. In May, it reportedly delayed the launch of its new flagship AI model as developers struggled to deliver performance upgrades, and executives have been public on earnings calls about the need to aggressively invest and shore up against competition. The Scale AI deal, and Meta’s subsequent sky-high budget for hiring AI talent, is Zuckerberg’s Hail Mary: paying a premium for some of the brightest minds in the AI world to safeguard Meta’s future. But although Meta is plying AI workers with staggering salaries, a mountain of money can’t buy everyone. Anthropic and DeepMind have reportedly had far fewer defections to Meta than OpenAI has, and that’s been an ongoing trend. The reason, to those inside the field, is obvious: the AI world is filled with true believers, and even the biggest companies need more than a cash offer to get many of them on their side. Industry insiders emphasized to The Verge that in a sector where almost any company will offer job security and a good salary, experienced AI engineers and researchers want to work somewhere that aligns with their values, whether their top priority is AI safety and the risks the tech poses for humanity’s future, the ethical considerations of AI’s impact on society today, or accelerating and advancing the tech quicker than anyone else. Some engineers, researchers, or scientists the company has approached have turned down Meta’s advances, industry sources tell The Verge. Competition for AI researchers is stiff, and building loyalty is vital. “At this point, at least a few hundred top researchers and engineers in the field are what’s sometimes called ‘post-money’ — they could retire, and you’re only going to attract or retain them if they believe in your vision, leadership style, etc.,” one AI industry source says. But especially at OpenAI, Meta seems to have found the dollar value of company loyalty — and exceeded it. OpenAI has been uniquely affected by Meta’s mission to poach leading AI talent. As many as 10 of its top researchers and model developers have reportedly joined Meta, with some receiving large signing bonuses and equity. While its size and talent make it an inevitable prime target, the company is also vulnerable due to a controversial restructuring from a nonprofit to for-profit venture and the departures of high-profile executives who went on to start competing AI companies. It underwent a huge upheaval during Sam Altman’s November 2023 ouster by OpenAI’s board and his subsequent Uno Reverse-style rehiring, which saw most of the board members who opposed him resign. Employees have also shared concerns about non-disparagement agreements and policies that raised questions about whether they would be able to access their equity, eroding some trust in leadership even when the policies were walked back. “A lot of the people working on this are genuinely convinced they’re building transformative technology that will reshape the world,” one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “For the people that were that mission-driven, there’s already been so much organizational turbulence” — he mentioned Altman’s firing and rehiring, OpenAI employees defecting to Anthropic, and governance changes — “that people are less anchored to the institution itself, so it’s easier to poach [from OpenAI] than the other labs.” In lieu of an official comment, OpenAI directed The Verge to a blog post from its global affairs team, which states, “Some eye-popping offers are being extended these days to a handful of terrifically talented researchers, including to folks at OpenAI. Some of these offers are coming with deadlines of just a few hours – literally ‘exploding offers’ – or with restrictions on whether or how they can be discussed.” The blog post goes on to say the company plans to cultivate talent across not just research, but also product, engineering, infrastructure, scaling, and safety. On Wednesday, the company announced it had hired four engineers away from companies like Tesla, xAI, and Meta. Now, OpenAI’s best defense against the losses is its own financial leverage. People that joined OpenAI early on, or even before the end of 2023, have had significant stock appreciation — the unit price jumped from $67 in a May 2023 tender offer to $210 at the end of 2024, according to a source familiar with the situation. And during the end of 2023, around the time of the OpenAI board roller coaster, there was a window in which OpenAI rushed to make hires from other companies who would sign on at the $67-per-unit figure, since there was a near-immediate 2.5x multiplier expected, the source says. With so many companies competing to hire AI talent, there have been high-level departures at many different companies. But even before this most recent hiring frenzy, OpenAI’s employees were being lured elsewhere at a higher-than-average rate. A 2025 SignalFire report analyzed retention patterns in AI and found that Anthropic was best at keeping people around, with 80 percent of employees hired at least two years ago at Anthropic remaining at the company at the conclusion of their second year. DeepMind came next at 78 percent, while OpenAI’s retention rate was markedly lower, at 67 percent — comparable to Meta’s 64 percent. The report, which came out in May before Meta’s Scale deal occurred, also found that engineers were “8 times more likely to leave OpenAI for Anthropic than the reverse,” and 11 times more likely to defect from DeepMind to Anthropic than the reverse. Anthropic was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives with the goal of carefully developing AI technology, describing itself as an “AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.” The company’s “mission-driven safety focus” is a convincing recruitment pitch and a key reason for its low turnover, one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “The priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with” “I’ve seen, amongst people who are a little bit more seasoned in industry … they have watched tech as an industry change, and they’ve watched the people in the industry become very different, and the priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with,” says Rumman Chowdhury, a longtime leader in the field of responsible AI at companies like Accenture and Twitter, who now heads up the AI nonprofit Humane Intelligence. When she’s hiring AI engineers, she says, they often say that salary hikes are less important to them than to “not be contributing to a worse world.” AI engineers and researchers can afford that idealism, and concerns about safety and the rush to commercialize the technology have dogged most leading AI companies. At OpenAI, for instance, months of controversy and public pressure about its upcoming transition into a for-profit entity led to the company changing its plans, ceding some control to its nonprofit arm even after the restructuring. The decision followed a public letter written by ex-employees and civic leaders to the California and Delaware attorneys general, with one former employee writing, “OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed.” There are questions, too, about the pace at which Meta is moving and its research priorities. Meta’s Scale AI investment came on the heels of Joelle Pineau’s departure as Meta VP and head of its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) division, a unit Meta folded into its larger AI efforts after previously describing it as “one of the only groups in the world with all the prerequisites for delivering true breakthroughs with some of the brightest minds in the industry.” Some saw FAIR’s restructuring as a sign that Meta was prioritizing products over research, an industry-wide concern for some AI safety experts. For Meta, however, there are also pragmatic questions about its future in AI. In conversations with The Verge, industry insiders questioned whether Wang is the right choice to head the new lab, since Scale AI does not build frontier models and Wang himself doesn’t have an AI research background. And even Meta executives admit that catching up will be a challenge. During its most recent earnings call in April, Zuckerberg — who called one of Meta’s focuses for 2025 “making Meta AI the leading personal AI” — touched on the competition he was up against. “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we’re working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams we need to achieve our goals,” he said. Just two months later, that team became Meta’s superintelligence lab. But the AI engineer who steered clear doesn’t regret his decision. “You’re expected to give pretty much your whole self to Meta AI,” he says. The money simply wasn’t good enough for that.

US Stock Market Today saw the Dow rise while the Nasdaq dipped as investors balanced Nvidia’s $4 trillion milestone with new Trump tariff threats. Nvidia (NVDA) led recent tech gains, but President Trump’s warning of 50% tariffs on Brazil and threats to other countries stirred fresh concerns. Delta Airlines (DAL) jumped 12% after strong Q2 earnings. Meanwhile, jobless claims dropped to 227,000, keeping hopes alive for a possible Fed rate cut. As AI momentum grows and global trade faces uncertainty, Wall Street is watching both Nvidia’s rise and Trump’s aggressive trade push very closely.

Learn more and register today. – Sarah Morton Two years ago, I took on the role of editor for Crypto for Advisors at a pivotal moment. It was mid-2023, and the cryptocurrency industry was in the midst of a deep winter. The collapse of major lending platforms and the implosion of FTX had sent shockwaves through the markets. The U.S. regulatory climate was hostile, marked by enforcement-first tactics, and confidence was shaken. But even then, the undercurrents of something bigger were impossible to ignore. Fast forward to today, and we’re standing on the edge of what Bank of America calls a “once-in-a-millennium transformation.” They’re not talking about memes or speculation. They’re talking about the reshaping of global financial infrastructure, economic models, and digital ownership — and it’s being driven by crypto. An Ode to Bitcoin: The Genesis “Bitcoin belongs in the same breath as the printing press and artificial intelligence.” — Bank of America: Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, created something revolutionary: a decentralized, fixed-supply digital currency. It belonged to no government, no corporation, and no central authority. From there, a movement began. Early adoption saw students tinkering with GPUs, developers building wallets, entrepreneurs launching exchanges, and miners chasing cheap power around the globe. A technological and economic revolution took shape. Today, we’re seeing bitcoin ETFs from the world’s largest asset managers — BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale being the top three by AUM — and even nation-state adoption as countries like the U.S. and UAE race to become global crypto hubs. It’s an unparalleled acceleration of financial innovation. The Rise of Ethereum and Smart Contracts Bitcoin sparked the fire, but Ethereum — and the smart contract innovation it introduced — brought utility, programmability, and the ability to tokenize everything: real estate, carbon credits, fine art, identity, equities, and even yield-generating protocols. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, tens of thousands of digital assets exist. And while investing grabs the spotlight, blockchain is quietly transforming supply chains, intellectual property, finance, and more. Public companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Over 140 public firms have announced bitcoin reserves. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken will offer tokenized equities, while retail platforms like Robinhood expand their crypto products. Access points are multiplying: direct-to-consumer platforms, ETFs (now in the hundreds), tokenized funds, and direct ownership. And the list keeps growing. The Landscape Has Changed — Are You Adopting? Only a handful of advisors were very early adopters but that’s slowly evolving. There’s broadening recognition of the opportunity — to support clients, protect relationships, and win new business. It's becoming increasingly common to hear from advisors that they are winning clients simply because they’re willing to talk about bitcoin. On the other hand, the lack of regulation, prohibitive firm policies, digital assets volatility behavior and overall uncertainty with a new asset class has caused hesitancy. Moreover, advisors have a lot to pay attention to —- and now learning a new — and always changing — asset class is added to the list! Despite all of this, clients want to access digital assets. Recent Coinshares survey data highlights that clients want the help of their advisors and expect them to be knowledgeable in digital assets. More than 80% of the respondents answered that they would be more likely to work with an advisor that offers digital asset guidance, and 78% of non-crypto investors say they’d turn to an advisor if crypto support were available. Notably, almost 90% said they planned to increase their crypto exposure in 2025. A Call to Action Blockchain is an infrastructure, crypto is more than an asset class and the technology extends well beyond investing. The industry is maturing,regulation is advancing andthe world’s largest institutions are developing on blockchain. As U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently, “Crypto is the most important phenomenon happening in the world today.” You don’t need to be a crypto trader or blockchain developer. But if you’re a fiduciary — a guide, a planner — you owe it to your clients to understand what’s happening. Education is key. In two years of curating this newsletter, I’ve watched sentiment shift from skepticism to curiosity to strategic integration. And we’re just getting started. I’m thrilled to be here with you on your crypto journey. Connect with me for ideas on future topics you’d like to see addressed. - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc. Q. Why is the same digital asset priced differently on each exchange? A. Equities “plug in” to an exchange, allowing for one, centralized price. Crypto, on the contrary, is “decentralized.” This means there’s not one “plug” to price a digital asset. While crypto prices are based on supply and demand (as well as other factors), each exchange operates independently and therefore prices can vary between different exchanges. Q. How can I find reliable pricing data for digital assets? A. There are many digital asset index and data providers. Look for pricing that (1) comes from a reputable and trusted provider with a proven track record in digital assets, (2) has a transparent and rules-based approach to construction, and (3) lays out thoughtfully constructed criteria for how the pricing is captured. The index methodology is incredibly important. For example, if selection criteria of an index included “trading on more than one eligible exchange” with eligibility thoughtfully designed, then in the case of the FTX collapse, FTT (the exchange token of FTX) wouldn’t have made it into the index. Thoughtful construction can rule out bad actors. Q. Why are people using bitcoin to measure the entire digital asset landscape? A. While bitcoin now accounts for 65% of the total digital asset market, there were times bitcoin was less than 40% of the market. One asset should not be a benchmark for the entire asset class. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Effective benchmarking must serve multiple constituencies—enabling performance evaluation, supporting investment strategies, and setting industry standards for everyone. Indices such as CoinDesk 5 (CD5), CoinDesk 20 (CD20), CoinDesk 80 (CD80), CoinDesk 100 (CD100) and CoinDesk Memecoin (CDMEME) were constructed to meet the needs of those looking to benchmark, trade and/or invest in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. - Kim Klemballa, CoinDesk Indices Keep Reading Kim Greenberg Klemballa contributed reporting.

Title: ‘The Math Just Doesn’t Work’ – Analyst Hits JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs With Downgrade, Says Downside Risk Not Factored In

HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview, HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin. And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com. With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures, and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER. It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. The America Party Token ($AP) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER, $BEST, and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.

UK price: was £149.99 now £119.89 at Amazon I loved Assassin's Creed Shadows when it came out and have platinumed it since. This is a bargain considering the open-world-hours value it offers too.

Superb quality, and superb value for money.

It's perfect for cloud gaming via Amazon's Luna service, and even comes bundled with a free month of Luna+ if you're a new subscriber. Indeed, if you are looking to embrace streaming as your main form of gaming, then this bundle which gets you everything you need to be an Xbox console gamer without the console is a great offering. The PlayStation-focused variant of the Nova 5 is a brilliant headset for PS5 users, and with more than a third off its price this Prime Day, it is excellent value for money. UK price: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon In our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, we called this RPG "incredibly immersive" with "a staggering level of freedom" within its "beautiful and authentic environments". The combat is excellent too, and we said it was "challenging but well-balanced". Best UK price: was £49.99 now £36.99 at Currys This is a lowest-ever price for the Sony Inzone H3, and honestly, an incredible deal for a headset from the maker of the PS5 itself. This model is wired, but it offers fantastic audio quality and a capable microphone. UK price: was £89 now £45 at Amazon Not only does the 2TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD come with a fantastic $60 discount, but it also offers all of the same awesome strengths as the rest of the range. Coupled with the aforementioned heat sink, the drives all offer blisteringly fast read / write speeds of 7450MB/s / 6900MB/s. Not at all bad for less than $150. UK price: £173.85 at ebuyer Just a few bucks shy of half price, this is an essential PS5 accessory if you've grown tired of that DualSense low battery warning. It can be hooked up to your console or PC via USB-C, and you simply place your controller in the slot on top of the unit to begin charging. Simple. UK price: was £24.99 now £19.99 at Amazon My favorite gaming headset ever made, this is a great price for the Nova Pro Wireless, and in its chic white colorway. UK price : was £329.99 now £232.99 at Amazon Sign up for an invitation to buyWhile not on sale at this very moment, this is a noteworthy move by Amazon which up until now has seen very little in the way of stock or Switch 2 movement. UK: Bundles available at Very Even though it'll arrive a little after the Switch 2's launch, the next 3D Donkey Kong game is going to be a brilliant one to play as one of the first bona fide Switch 2 games. UK price: £64.95 at Amazon The mClassic is one of the best upscalers for Switch and retro consoles. It's able to take lower resolution images and bump them up to 1080p or 1440p, allowing for a much cleaner and sharper image overall. If you have a HDMI adapter for older consoles, the device has a dedicated 4:3 retro mode, too. UK price: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon Whether you're into Fortnite or not, I still recommend checking out the Nitro Deck. This superb Switch accessory is a handheld player's best friend, offering improved controls and a handy shell for keeping the display safe from harm while you're out and about. UK price: was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon This special edition Genshin Impact power bank by Ugreen features a 20,000 mAh battery and 100W fast charging, quickly charging everything from phones to portable consoles and laptops. It even has a built-in screen, with special themed animations. UK price: £74.99 at Amazon This is a new lowest-ever price for the Scuf Valor Pro, a wired Xbox controller that boasts Hall effect thumbsticks, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is probably my favorite Xbox controller, personally. Its modular design is brilliant and enables me to use it in a symmetrical layout, while the overall quality here is superb. An updated version of the eswap X Pro, this isn't a record low but still a tidy saving on a premium wired gaming controller for Xbox and PC. UK price: £169.39 at Amazon (Elden Ring edition) Maybe the best Xbox-specific gaming headset deal going right now, this the deal to go for if you're after some audio givers for team green's console. UK price: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon If the 2TB card that I've highlighted above is a bit much, then the 1TB alternative might be a better fit - and it's also on offer this Prime Day. UK price: £126.99 at Argos This complete recreation of the original Xbox controller - lovingly nicknamed the Duke for its chunky profile - is compatible with Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and PC. It's a fantastic way to revisit OG Xbox games on console via backwards compatibility. UK price: £99.99 at Tesco (yes, really) Another near-peerless Xbox audio deal, these earbuds are designed for Microsoft's console - that will work with everything else are at an all-time record-low price for Prime Day. UK price: was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon All the deals at the top of this page are still worth investigating, too, by the way, so definitely get involved with those links to see if you can find your Prime Day gaming deal that will boost your summer. Starting off with a bang for our UK readers, Amazon has come in clutch and is offering a bona fide 10% discount on the excellent PlayStation Portal handheld device. Deals and discounts have been incredibly hard to come by on the remote play PS5 streaming device, so this is absolutely worth shouting about. I love the Portal too, and it really has given me an extra way to tackle my backlog from the comfort of the sofa, or while away. UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon Good morning and welcome to the last day of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals of 2025. Today marks the last chance to grab something extra for your setup, add a cool game to your backlog on the cheap, or go for that big upgrade you've been considering. We're still seeing some belting discounts across all platforms and devices so use all those links above and we'll continue posting some awesome deals in our live coverage. I'm about to head off for the day, but not before I draw your attention to one of the very, very best deals that I've seen so far. The Sony Inzone H3 is a great headset from the PlayStation maker, offering easy plug-and-play compatibility and support for spatial sound. It performs well too, with fantastic audio quality and a flip-to-mute microphone that's ideal for chatting with friends. It's a decent deal at its regular $99.99 price, but this limited time offer knocks over 52% off! That takes it down to under $50, where it absolutely decimates the competition. If you're planning to buy a headset over Prime Day and don't want to spend a lot, then make sure that it's this one. US - Sony Inzone H3: was $99.99 now $48 at Amazon It just hit midnight here in the UK, which means that we are now officially on our final day of the latest Prime Day sale. If you need a quick recap, the event is running from July 8 to the end of July 11. This means that now is a good time to start pressing the purchase button if you've been stocking your basket, as there's no word on how long any deals could stick around once Prime Day comes to an end. We're also coming up to the final stretch of savings in the US, with less than 34 hours to go. Interested in a handheld PC? Then you should take a look at this ASUS Rog Ally bargain. The powerful system is currently hovering just 99p above its lowest-ever price at Amazon in the UK, which is an absolutely mega saving. Thanks to AMD's powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, you'll be able to enjoy a wide range of triple-A games at a 1920x1080 resolution on the crisp 7-inch 120Hz refresh rate screen. In our testing, it achieved an impressive 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 after some graphical tweaking, with even better performance for those willing to make use of frame generation. UK - ASUS ROG Ally: was £518.42 now £399.99 at Amazon The well-received Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has crashed down to a record low price for Prime Day. Right now the Xbox version can be yours for a whopping $36.59 off - beating the previous record low by a considerable margin. This post-apocalyptic survival adventure won't be for everyone, but fans of atmospheric and haunting experiences will absolutely love it. It features intense, realistic survival mechanics and a grounded world that's brought to life by modern high-end graphics. US - Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl: was $59.99 now $23.40 at Amazon Don't sleep on this incredible Razer Kishi Ultra discount. In my book it's by far the best mobile controller on the market, as long as you don't mind splashing out a bit. It offers an unbeatable level of comfort thanks to its full-size controller grips and offers no shortage of premium features. You get USB-C passthrough charging, full-size thumbsticks, Hall effect triggers, mechanical buttons and a clicky D-pad, and even some customizable RGB lighting strips. Where this mobile controller really leaves the competition in the dust though is its software, which is packed with useful additions including the ability to mimic on-screen commands with buttons to enable compatibility in titles that don't natively support a controller. It's an absolute game-changer for things like League of Legends Wild Rift. US - Razer Kishi Ultra: was $149.99 now $99.99 at Amazon Now this is a bit of a shocker: the PlayStation Portal has received a 10% discount in the UK. That might not sound like much, but it takes it down to a new lowest-ever price and is by far the best PS Portal deal that I've seen yet. The streaming handheld is a popular choice for PS5 owners, letting you play games straight from your console via the internet. It's not quite a PSP replacement, but it can come in clutch when you need to free up the TV for someone else. Its design is excellent too, effectively offering two sides of a DualSense Wireless Controller sandwiched around a screen with all the expected features like rumble, adaptive triggers, and more. Best of all, you don't even need to be a Prime member for this offer! UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon This is a US deal that I'm really jealous of. The Special Edition version of the superb Horizon Forbidden West has dropped to its lowest-ever price and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in trying the popular PlayStation series. Set in a futuristic open-world in which you have to survive against vicious, animal-like machines, it's ideal if you're craving a big, meaty experience that will keep you occupied for weeks. Although this is a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, no knowledge of that prior game is required to enjoy it. The Special Edition also nets you a SteelBook, mini art book, and a digital soundtrack to enjoy. US - Horizon Forbidden West Special Edition: was $79.99 now $39.99 at Amazon I've spotted another budget-friendly headset in the Prime Day sales, this time the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 - which is down to a new lowest-ever price! Compatible with PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, it offers plenty of adjustability and a retractable noise-cancelling microphone. Although nothing special the sound is decent for the price. Where this headset really wins, however, is in its comfortable ski-band head strap design and plush ear cushions. UK - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1: was £59.99 now £31.34 at Amazon Getting into the world doesn't have to be expensive - just look at this affordable microphone from HyperX. The HyperX SoloCast is currently on sale for a lowest-ever price in the UK, with a whopping 30% off. It's rare to see items from trusted brands like this at such low prices. The main reasons to pick the SoloCast is its ease-of-use: this is a simple, plug-and-play microphone that delivers impressive sound right out of the box. The tap-to-mute sensor and adjustable stand are also great inclusions at the price range and make recording or even just chatting with friends a breeze. UK - HyperX SoloCast: was £36.89 now £25.64 at Amazon We consider the Meta Quest 3S to be one of the very best VR headsets on the market, scoring five stars in our review, where we called it "the only VR headset you need" whether you're completely new to VR or an experienced headset owner. It strikes the perfect balance between performance, practicality, and price. Over Amazon Prime Day, that price tag has got even more tempting, however, with a record discount available right now. In you've been waiting for the chance to dive into the world of VR gaming, you shouldn't pass on this. US - Meta Quest 3S: was $299.99 now $249 at Amazon UK - Meta Quest 3S: was £289 now £237.99 at Amazon If you're still using your Nintendo Switch and want to get a little bit Peely with it, then accessory maker PowerA has you covered. This neon yellow carrying case is based on the iconic Fortnite character and even comes with a code for an in-game item. It fits the original Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, and Nintendo Switch Lite, with built-in storage space for games, small accessories, and even a little padded stand. The current offer is also the lowest price that this model has ever been, though only a few cents. US - PowerA Protection Case for Nintendo Switch (Fortnite Peely): was $22.99 now $12.29 at Amazon Right now you can grab the Atari 7800+ at an absolutely incredible 54% off - taking it down to just under $60 at Amazon. For that price you get a fully-featured retro-style games console, plus a controller and an original game cartridge for Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest. On top of this, the console supports original Atari 2600 or 7800 game cartridges, so it could be perfect if you want to grow your own retro collection or have some old games lying around. US - Atari 7800+: was $129.99 now $59.99 at Amazon Hey everyone! Dash again, back to take over. I'm currently scanning the web for the latest gaming deals, so bear with me for a few moments as I hand-pick the very best ones to share... If, like me, you were an early Nintendo Switch adopter, you might find your console is getting a little long in the tooth. But if you''re not ready to upgrade to the Switch 2 just yet, you're in luck: one of the best accessories released for the Switch Gen 1 is now available at its lowest ever price. The Nitro Deck is the perfect way to give your handheld a bit of an update. Slot your screen inside it and it'll give you more ergonomic grip and protect your Switch from knocks. But its biggest benefit is it will banish that annoying stick drift with its Hall effect thumbsticks – something I've experienced more times than I'd like the recall. As a gamer of a certain age, I have very fond memories of my GameCube so I particularly love the purple Nitro Deck on offer here, although both the gray and mint colorways are also on offer. US - CRKD Nitro Deck: was $79.99 now $47.99 at Amazon UK - CRKD Nitro Deck: was £59.99 now £47.49 at Amazon Another bargain PS5 game now and one that's at its lowest price ever in the UK – and not far off in the US. A spiritual successor to the Zoo Tycoon series, Planet Zoo puts you in charge of your own menagerie, allowing you to handcraft your own exquisite animal exhibits filled with everything from Aldabra giant tortoises to western lowland gorillas. Confession time. I'm an enormous PlanZoo addict: I've racked up a truly disgusting 1,200 hours in the game and have no intention of stopping any time soon. Part of what makes the game worth investing your money – and an enormous amount of time – in its the creative freedom it gives you. If you love being able to obsess over details to create your dream zoo, it's a really rewarding experience. It's already offers a huge amount of playtime for a pretty modest spend. And with this deal, that value gets even harder to ignore. US - Planet Zoo (PS5): was $49.99 now $34.99 at Amazon UK - Planet Zoo (PS5): was £39.99 now £19.94 at Amazon Hi there! Josh here, now taking over the live blogging to give Dash a quick break. I've been working behind the scenes all Prime Day writing up deals so I'll be bringing you some of my favorite options from across the sales over the coming hour. So without any further ado... Okay, this is a bit of a weird one but might be worth checking out if you're using Prime Day as a chance to stock on gifts. Gaming brand HyperX makes a mini headset designed specifically for kids, and it's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price. I had the chance to try it out at Gamescom last year and, while it absolutely didn't fit on my massive gamer head I can attest to its durability. The headset is seriously flexible and didn't so much as creak when I tried my hardest to snap it into pieces in front of the horrified PR representative. Its hard-wearing materials aside, the headset is compatible with all major platforms thanks to the 3.5mm headphone jack and comes in a range of attractive colorways. US - HyperX Cloud Mini Kids: was $29.99 now $19.99 at Amazon The critically acclaimed Split Fiction has received a massive lowest-ever Prime Day discount and should be in your basket! The co-op action-adventure game came out back in March, so a deal this generous is a real surprise. It received the full five out of five stars from us here at TechRadar Gaming, which is very rare indeed. We loved its innovative mechanics and the seemingly endless variety of different playstyles crammed into the game. It's also visually stunning, pulling off both sci-fi and fantasy settings with impressive fidelity. Just bear in mind that this is a co-op only game before you buy - you can't play it solo in any capacity. Luckily, each copy comes with a handy 'Friend's Pass', which allows you to play with a buddy who doesn't own it at no additional cost US - Split Fiction (PS5): was $49.99 now $35 at Amazon UK - Split Fiction (PS5): was £44.99 now £30.99 at Amazon Time for one of my personal Prime Day favorites! Every year we see massive discounts on the fantastic Backbone One mobile controller and the ongoing sale is no exception. If you're after a versatile mobile gamepad, then I would highly recommend it. It's a fantastic all-rounder and the perfect companion if you're planning some travel and need something to keep you entertained in a pinch. Right now the best price is on the PlayStation Edition, which comes in an attractive white colorway and has DualSense Wireless Controller themed buttons. US - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was $99.99 now $69.99 at Amazon UK - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was £60 now £40 at Amazon Another wired Xbox controller deal here with the Thrustmaster Heart. This unique-looking controller is named after its H.E.A.R.T. anti-drift thumbsticks, which incorporates Hall effect technology for enhanced durability and precision. On top of this, it features two remappable rear buttons, mechanical face buttons, and even a customizable RGB lighting strip right down the middle of the pad. It's currently the lowest-ever price it's been in the UK with a £28.25 discount for Prime Day! UK - Thrustmaster Heart Controller: was £89.99 now £61.74 at Amazon The Razer Blackshark V2 X is a fantastic gaming headset that comes personally recommended by our Hardware Editor Rhys Wood. It's the headset that he uses every day, as it offers the perfect balance of audio quality, microphone performance, attractive design, and affordability. Right now it's just a few bucks off its lowest-ever price and is a fantastic pick if you're looking for a capable gaming audio device that isn't going to completely empty your wallet - leaving you with some left over cash to spend on even more Prime Day gaming deals! US - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was $59.99 now $36.08 at Amazon UK - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was £41.99 now £32.99 at Amazon The Scuf Valor Pro is an excellent controller from a seriously well-regarded brand. It boasts a number of features that make it a perfect fit for Call of Duty games, including adjustable triggers, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is a wired-only model, which might be a shame for some, but comes in at a more affordable price than other Scuf products. At the moment, it's even been discounted down to lowest-ever rate for Prime Day. US - Scuf Valor Pro: was $109.99 now $85.49 at Amazon Hello gamers! Dash here to take things over on the live coverage front. I've been trawling the sale for the last few days, so have plenty of bargains to share with you. Sit back, relax, and get ready for some deals. I'm going to start off strong with a personal pick... Right, I'm actually stepping away from our live coverage for a bit now leaving you in the capable hands of my gamer colleague Dash. I will be here again tomorrow though, so until then, happy deal hunting! There's never a bad time to get another controller into your setup as a spare or just to grow or fill out your collection stylishly. As a result, the discounts this Prime Day on Xbox Wireless Controllers are both easy to recommend and worth investing in if you're on the hunt for a new pad. US – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was $64.99 now $47.49 at Amazon UK – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon Speaking of adding things to existing setups that make things better, this is something I've recently added to my PS5 Pro setup and have been seriously impressed by: the Creative Sound BlasterX G6 USB sound card. Traditionally, I've always been a wireless-only kind of guy for my setup, but since testing this out and going back to a wired headset for a bit with it, I'm not sure if I can game any other way now. The sound difference and quality the G6 has given me on PS5 is exquisite and has made the audio of Death Stranding something almost otherworldly. What's more, it's now down to a record low price in the UK and a heavily discounted price in the US. Nice. US – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was $179.99 now $139.99 at Amazon UK – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was £129.99 now £81.59 at Amazon To take a small diversion from my own personal gaming picks, this one is an absolute belter if you're on Nintendo Switch - especially in the face of Switch 2 stock being hard to find. If you've ever wanted your OG Switch to perform and look a bit better on the big screen, then this is the device you should invest in: the mClassic upscaler. It'll take your low resolution images and bump them up while simultaneously polishing them right up. Simple but very effective. US – Marseille mClassic: was $99.99 now $74.99 at Amazon UK – Marseille mClassic: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon However, if you prefer a headset, then let me direct you to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X which is currently enjoying brillianlty low prices on both sides of the Atlantic. This is one of the best value, and best overall packages of a headset that I can remember testing, and given the superb audio quiality and limitless compatibiltiy of the Nova 5X, this is a no brainer for anyone looking for a headset this Prime Day.US - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was $149.99 now $99.74 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon The first deal I want to highlight is on one of my most favorite bits of gaming gear of the past couple of years. Simply put, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are the best gaming earbuds money can buy in my view, and now that they've reached historic low prices as part of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals, there's literally never been a better time to pick them up. No matter your platform, if you're after some buds, these are the ones to go for. US – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was $199.99 now £147.99 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon I'm going to get the ball rolling with some of my absolute top picks for the best Prime Day gaming deals I've spotted. These are going to be on some of my favorite games that I've played and bits of gear that I've tested - a theme of our overall approach here as my colleagues will be doing the same. We will absolutely still be highlighting discounts and deals more broadly though - there's so much good stuff out there, after all! Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the very best Prime Day gaming deals that you can spend your money on right now. We're just over the halfway point of the four-day Prime Day extravaganza, but there's plenty to shout about and dig into so let's do exactly that!

Title: The Persecution of Francesca Albanese. Chris Hedges
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/persecution-francesca-albanese-chris-hedges/5894678
Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:06:33Z
Full Content:
When the history of the genocide in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning. Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable. She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world” that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “Genocide as colonial erasure,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “A Genocide Foretold.” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true, as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue. The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted. She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here or watch below. Her latest report lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur. Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S. and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression, the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter, the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?” Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers, checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations, brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance, are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. The S&P 500 has been setting record highs in recent days, a dramatic turn from the market selloff back in April. But analysts are warning fortunes could change if overall market participation in the rally holds at the current rate. The new heights the S&P is reaching are being undermined by narrow company participation in those highs, according to a July 5 report from Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at wealth and investment management firm Oppenheimer & Co., and first reported by Bloomberg. Referred to as market breadth, analysts often try to see how many companies in a specific index or sector are participating in a rally to gauge how healthy it really is. That is important to track, says Wald, because narrow participation can mask underlying weakness in the market: Since 1972, the S&P 500 has posted below-average returns over the next one-, three-, six-, and 12-month periods when its all-time high coincides with fewer than 100 companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also hitting new highs, the analysis finds. At the last market high, 88 companies on the NYSE also hit a high. Indeed, big tech companies have been the drivers behind the recent market heights: Just five stocks—Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA)—are contributing over half of the S&P 500’s total return, according to an analysis from Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. It’s always a concern when just a few companies are responsible for most of the gains—because that means those gains could easily turn into losses depending on the strength of just a handful of companies. That’s what happened in mid-2023, when a Magnificent Seven–driven rally faded. And while the S&P 500 was less than 1% away from a new high at Wednesday’s close, the median S&P 500 stock was trading about 12% below a 52-week high, Turnquist finds. “Breadth is a little underwhelming,” he writes. “For context, over the last decade, the gap between the index and the median stock’s 52-week highs has averaged around 5%.” The good news, according to analysts, is that market breadth has been improving in recent weeks. The share of stocks in the S&P 500 above their 200-day moving average is 61%, just below the 10-year average of 62%, says Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII). Another positive sign for the market: All S&P 500 sectors have participated in the rally. Haverland says he expects to see more improvement in broader participation as investors get greater clarity on fiscal and trade policies. “Given the strong rally, however, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some consolidation in the coming months as the economy and earnings begin to digest the evolving trade policy,” Haverland says. “So, it may be a good time to rebalance portfolios.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: If I ran X
URL: https://werd.io/if-i-ran-x/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:54:17Z
Full Content:
How to transform the internet's most toxic platform into essential infrastructure. “After two incredible years,” Linda Yaccarino tweeted, “I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏.” It was the day after the company’s AI chatbot, Grok, began calling itself MechaHitler and started spewing antisemitic slurs and advocating for Adolf Hitler in public until the company eventually had to remove them. Many of the users still posting to X greeted the antisemitism warmly; some tweeted, “finally”. No new CEO has been named. I’ve previously written about what I’d do if I ran Bluesky product, Mastodon, my own platform, and a fund supporting the open social web. I’d intended to stop the series there. But as there’s an opening: let’s imagine I was handed the reins to the most toxic mainstream social network. What would I do if I was the new CEO of X? I have some history with the people behind Twitter, the site that eventually became X. I consider multiple people who were there at the site’s inception, as well as many people who worked there in its later years, to be friends; Biz Stone sat on my first startup’s advisory board; I worked for Ev Williams at Medium for a little while. I’ve heard various pieces of founding stories from each of them. And I really loved using Twitter. Long before Elon Musk bought it, I was an addicted user who posted many times a day. It opened up communities for me: I attended Twestivals (and hosted one), saw Ben Walker play his Twitter Song live, took part in countless hashtag games and still own a tote bag I won from the literary magazine Granta for writing a tweet-length horror story. Every time I went to an industry event or a conference, I’d be in the Twitter backchannel, making and reading observations, and building new connections. And then, one day, Elon Musk walked into the building carrying a kitchen sink and began to refashion it around his need to amass power and influence to bring about his edgelord, pronatalist, Hitler-saluting view of the world. The name changed to X, Musk’s original name for PayPal, a company whose board voted to fire him as CEO due to mismanagement. Musk fired 80% of the staff, cratered the morale of the people who remained, reinstated Nazi accounts, hate speech surged — and the rest is history. I’ve been given the reins. I’m CEO now. Can it be saved? Throughout this tumult, X’s active user numbers have remained remarkably steady. 2024’s 335.7M monthly active users represented a 9% drop from 2022, the year Musk acquired Twitter. TechCrunch recently reported that its web views remain vastly higher than new competitors like Threads and Bluesky. Famously, many brands and journalists have been reticent to leave the site, despite its near-constant onslaught of white supremacy and hate speech. In other words: the traffic is there. These users may be a mix of bots, literal Nazis, and people who don’t mind posting on a site that is heavily used by literal Nazis, but there are hundreds of millions of them. So that’s something. On the other hand, its revenue tanked following the acquisition, with some reports showing a drop as big as 66%. More recently, it saw 17.5% growth between 2024 and 2025, but it needs to claw back a lot of ground if it wants to return to its 2021 revenue peak — and even then, it posted a loss for most of the decade that preceded it. In short: its online culture is toxic, its finances are decimated, and morale at the company is through the floor. But there is a great deal of remaining traffic, and many stalwarts have refused to give up followings they spent over a decade building. If we want to turn it around, the only place it’s possible to start is the culture of the company itself. Everything else flows from there. First, let’s address the ketamine in the room: there is no possible cultural turnaround at X while Elon Musk owns the site or has a significant stake. It must be acquired from him. That may seem far-fetched, but much of his wealth is stored in Tesla stock; in a world where his political machinations tank the price of his cash cow, he may need liquidity through other means. X’s valuation had already declined by 80%; his own xAI acquired it at a relative discount. As X’s culture continues to degrade, it may prove to be a drag on the valuation of his AI startup. The benefits of offloading it, in other words, may begin to outweigh the benefits to keeping it. A coalition of hands-on investors would be needed to perform this acquisition, but consider the upside: a de-Nazified Twitter would be worth considerably more than its current incarnation. Musk had previously taken it private; the revived company could once again be floated on the stock market. The potential gains would be significant. A newly-independent X would then be ripe for change. Executives and managers who were loyal to Musk would need to be removed. It’s not a given that other employees were fully on board with his “extremely hardcore”, hard-right ideology: some may have needed to remain to maintain their visas or to ensure a paycheck in a tough hiring environment. Internally, diversity policies and mandatory inclusion training would return. Protections for work-life balance would return, and remote work would once again be allowed, with a staged roll-out. Work would be undertaken to establish an internal culture of empathy, which is a hard requirement for building non-toxic communities; experts like Carole Robin and Vernā Myers would be heavily drawn on for ongoing manager training and culture guidance, and experts like Dr Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru would be drawn on to help the company be mindful the implications of ongoing work. This is the work of years, but the process would begin immediately. To be clear, it’s not that employees would need to be left-wing. This isn’t an inquisition, and a company culture that only allows one political alignment is more harmful than good. But basic human decency would once again be a value: hate speech and bigotry would be explicitly disallowed, and it would be made obvious that the aim of Twitter’s platform is to create a community where voices from a diversity of communities should feel safe to post, which starts with internal cultural expectations. Nazi accounts would need to be banned again, swiftly, with their posts preserved internally in a vault in a de facto legal hold. The messages would be made available as a dataset to organizations that research and investigate hate groups, although users would have the ability to have their content removed in accordance with relevant privacy legislation for their jurisdiction. Significant investments would be made into non-profits and on-the-ground organizations that support the vulnerable communities harmed by the hate speech, doxxing, and other activities previously enabled on X. A commitment would be made for ongoing support: it couldn’t be a one-and-done gesture. A permanent, inclusive trust and safety council would be established, modeled after the Supreme Court, with real, encoded power to affect company policies around content and moderation. This council and its permanence would be defined in the articles of association of the new company; it would be almost impossible to remove them. Its members would be guaranteed a salary (but could not own stock) and required to both adjudicate on content moderation issues and intervene during strategic lapses. The number of members of the council would increase based on active users but could never decrease. Employees who objected to these measures would be free to take a buyout. Some would likely just quit. Meanwhile, the company would begin to aggressively hire across the board, including but not limited to engineering, product, research, design, partnerships, communications, and trust and safety. Public statements and heavy PR would signal the internal cultural changes in order to attract new applicants. The name and brand would be symbolically restored to Twitter, indicating a clean break from the Musk years. It’s a trustworthy brand, and the change back would likely turn heads. But it would be a mistake to simply return the company to its old self. The new Twitter needs to be something else entirely. It’s now clear that Musk’s acquisition was about amassing power, not providing value. As Dan Primack wrote in Axios last year: While this might seem like a selling point to a would-be autocrat, it serves as a weakness to Twitter as a business. Not only does this property make it vulnerable to takeovers from terrible people, but it elevates the company’s business decisions to a level where a mistake could significantly impact democracy or even public safety around the world. (This is also the lesson Meta failed to learn in Myanmar.) In turn, this could subject the company to greater regulatory scrutiny and oversight. It may seem like value at first sight, but it’s actually a business risk. So how can the new Twitter be incredibly valuable but also safer from regulatory oversight? The core value of Twitter is not its social network as such. That’s always been a means to an end. The vast majority of content on the site has historically been created by just 10% of users, but people don’t log in to post: they want to see what other people are saying. The point of Twitter is to find out what’s going on right now and get an insight into the conversation around it. My new Twitter would retain the social network but expand upon the idea that people want to know what’s happening right now. The feed would expand to not just include Twitter’s own conversations, but every public conversation across the social web. Search, trending topics, and live dashboards would represent the entire addressable real-time web, using open standards and protocols like AT Protocol, ActivityPub, and RSS. Twitter would become the way to find out what’s happening everywhere. Some social networks — like Facebook — would not be available via this feed. The addressable social web would consist of sites that embrace open protocols (best), or otherwise make a content deal directly with Twitter (less good). However, a Twitter that aims to provide the pulse of the internet and not necessarily a social network in itself is less of a competitor to closed networks; in fact, the tools may provide new engagement and users for them. The aim would be, over time, to make not being represented on the feed more of a business liability for closed social networking platforms than being included. Twitter would provide libraries, ecosystem support, and even funding for open social web protocols: its value increases as the the social web pie gets bigger. Monetization would be three-prong. Advertising would remain on public feeds, and a renewed focus on trust and safety would improve brand safety, bringing advertising prices back up. Twitter Blue premium profiles on the social network would remain. But most differently, enterprise tools for tracking public sentiment and yielding unique insights from the global conversation would be made available for corporations, media companies, and governments. These tools would also be made available to public research institutions, with some restrictions, for free. Using open protocols should help reduce regulatory risk. In this world, trust and safety is as much about de-listing external content as it is about policing the in-house social network. Aggregating across the entire social web is an enormous infrastructure task that requires real resources and expertise to carry out; the compliance demands across global jurisdictions are complex but fully within Twitter’s wheelhouse. The moat for the business is, in part, the combination of the difficulty of building the tools and their ease of use for end users. In-house expertise would create proprietary machine learning algorithms for sentiment and insight analysis, and integrations with third-party tools like CRMs and analytics platforms could embed the platform in existing enterprise ecosystems. It’s a very similar model to how Google originally became the dominant search engine: simplicity of use combined with the sophistication of its internal technology, all layered over the open web. It’s not even particularly unprecedented: Blaine Cook, then CTO of Twitter, was fired for demonstrating interoperability with Jaiku, another social network. For this new Twitter, interoperability would be core to its value. This transformation wouldn’t happen overnight. A still-aggressive but more realistic timeline might look like: Once established, the new Twitter would set the tone for the social web itself. By implication, it wouldn’t just be the way that conversations were discovered; people would find platforms this way, too. By not hyper-focusing on its own social network, it has the potential to become a much bigger and more valuable company: one that people use to unlock the entire online social conversation. By using open protocols, the company ensures the whole internet isn’t locked into its services, but by caring for trust and safety, design, and the quality of its feeds, it provides best-in-class options for people to choose. And it fosters a bigger, more interesting social web in the process. Does X or Twitter actually need to be saved? Absolutely not. There are plenty of new social networks that are more interesting, more fun to use, and show more promise. But there’s interesting potential here, both to remove a major source of toxicity on the internet, to diffuse a centralized source of power that can be abused by autocrats and oligarchs, and to create a way to elevate the entire social web. So that’s what I would do if I was CEO. "I do not have the time or emotional energy to screen out regular attacks by Large Language Models, with the knowledge that making the wrong decision costs a real human being their connection to a niche community." It's wild to me how many people are still engaging with X. As more people look to AI to learn about the world, the people who control how it's trained and how it responds will control our prevailing narratives. That's wildly dangerous. Forget San Francisco - I wish every single US city would do this. We're too car-dependent, too isolated, too unhealthy. (Honestly, European mixed-use development should be the model.)

Title: $21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone

Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:51:16Z

On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT). Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide: spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection. By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year, protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges, as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94. Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains. This is not financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR) and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, as the markets can be volatile and unpredictable.

Title: The SEC Is Crashing the Digital Stocks Party
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-sec-is-crashing-the-digital-stocks-party-2000627381
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:20:28Z
Full Content:
For years, the promise of blockchain technology has captivated the financial world, hinting at a future where traditional assets are transformed into nimble, digital “tokens.” This vision, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce puts it, is “enchanting, but not magical.” SheÂ just sent a clear message to anyone hoping blockchain would free them from financial regulation: not so fast. Commissioner Peirce acknowledged the promise of tokenization, the process of turning real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based digital tokens. But she warned that, no matter how futuristic it sounds, the same old rules still apply. âTokenized securities are still securities,â Peirce said in a statement. âThe same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.â Her statement comes amid a frenzy of experimentation in tokenized finance. Firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Robinhood Markets are exploring how to tokenize everything from stocks and treasuries to real estate and private credit. The hype is real: blockchain-based markets promise 24/7 trading, faster settlement, better transparency, and a radically cheaper financial system. But the SEC is reminding everyone that innovation doesnât mean exemption. If youâre creating or selling tokenized securities, even if you’re just wrapping real assets in a digital shell, youâre still subject to decades-old laws governing how financial instruments are issued, traded, and disclosed. The goal of federal securities laws is to protect investors and ensure fair, orderly markets. The End of the Stock Market As We Know It Tokenization refers to the creation of digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets. These can be as simple as company shares or as complex as bundles of loans. Think of it as taking something traditionalâlike a Tesla stockâand putting it into a blockchain wallet so it can be traded like cryptocurrency. But not all tokens are created equal. Some are issued directly by the company (like a tokenized share of a public company), while others are created by third parties who hold the real assets and issue their own tokenized version. According to Peirce, those third-party tokens carry âunique risks,â especially for retail investors who may not actually own the underlying asset. âA token could be a âreceipt for a security,â which is itself a security but is distinct from the underlying security,â Peirce explained. Or worse, it could qualify as a âsecurity-based swap,â whichÂ are typically used by sophisticated investors and are heavily regulated, often restricted from being traded by everyday people (“retail persons”) off of regulated exchanges. If a token falls into this category, it could face severe trading restrictions. Tokenization could reshape how regular people invest, borrow, and access wealth. But it also raises serious questions: Who actually owns these tokenized assets? What happens when a crypto firm collapses or loses customer funds? And what protections do Main Street investors have? Tokenization could make markets faster and more accessible, even allowing people to own fractions of stocks and assets. But Peirceâs statement throws cold water on the idea that blockchain makes all that risk-free. The SECâs message is that innovation must come with compliance. Peirce, one of the more crypto-friendly voices at the agency, still made it clear: âThe process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not new.â Whether it lives on-chain or off-chain, itâs still under the SECâs jurisdiction. Peirce encouraged firms to engage with the SEC early and often if they want to build tokenized products legally. She also hinted that the agency is open to modernizing outdated rules or creating exemptions, but only if firms play by the rules. For now, the crypto and finance industries have been put on notice. Tokenized finance isnât a legal gray zone. Itâs Wall Street on-chain. The message is clear: the future of finance will be built on innovation, but also on accountability.

Title: NVIDIA became the first $4 trillion company — here's how the tech giant beat Microsoft and Apple

The AI arms race drove NVIDIA to become a $4 trillion company. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA was briefly worth $4 trillion this week. The tech giant passed that milestone and became the first $4 trillion company following a 2.5% increase in stock value at one point on July 9, 2025. The valuation of NVIDIA has since dropped to around $3.97 trillion. NVIDIA began 2025 behind Microsoft and Apple, but steady growth has pushed NVIDIA past other tech giants. Growth is expected to continue for NVIDIA. The company provides computing power for several of the biggest AI tools, which has proven quite lucrative for the GPU maker. NVIDIA's surge to a $4 trillion valuation is due largely to the company's dominance in the AI space. As companies race to integrate AI into everything from computers to personal assistants, the demand for computing power increases. Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Google, and other companies release AI-powered products regularly and have integrated AI into existing services. Microsoft was reportedly NVIDIA's largest customer in 2024, outspending Meta, Google, and other tech giants. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. ChatGPT launched in 2022, sparking an AI arms race. NVIDIA's value has increased fifteenfold since OpenAI released its AI-powered tool. "Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate," said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang when discussing financial results in May 2025. It was more than an initial surge for NVIDIA. The tech giant reached a $2 trillion valuation in February 2024 and then passed the $3 trillion mark just four months later. NVIDIA's stock price now sits around $163, though that will fluctuate throughout the week. Shares are up about 22% on the year for NVIDIA. NVIDIA stock dipped slightly, dropping the company's value to just under $4 trillion. But given recent trends, it is likely NVIDIA will pass the milestone again. It's more than NVIDIA stock that's risen over the last few years. The company brought in $44.1 billion in revenue in the financial quarter ending in April 2025. That was a 69% year-over-year increase for the tech giant. Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

July 10, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: MP Materials Stock Surges 50% on Rare Earths Contract With Defense Department

Shares of MP Materials (MP) surged 50% in Thursday morning after the rare earths miner announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with the Department of Defense. The DoD is set to become MP Materials' largest shareholder at 15% following an initial $400 million purchase of a new class of "preferred stock convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, and a warrant permitting DoD to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock." MP Materials will use the government investment, along with a $1 billion funding line from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to fund the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility at a yet-to-be-decided location. The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

July 10, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

LAST UPDATE | 10 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney, who is facing up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland, has agreed to be extradited from the US to Dublin. Gibney, who was arrested in Florida last week, has withdrawn his application to contest his extradition ahead of a court appearance tomorrow, according to court documents seen by The Journal. The 77-year-old was living in the US for 30 years and was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. He was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction which prevented the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. Advertisement A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. The podcast series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by the accused. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. He was arrested in Florida last week, where he has been living for nearly three decades, on foot of an international warrant which was issued by Irish authorities. It is understood that Irish and US law enforcement had prepared for the arrest for over a week. Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes last week. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge tomorrow for a detention hearing. Court documents filed ahead of the hearing yesterday, which have been seen by The Journal, state that Gibney withdrew his application to contest the extradition and agreed to being extradited to Ireland after being advised of his rights earlier this week.

US stock market today opened slightly lower as Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures paused after a powerful tech rally led by Nvidia, which just hit a historic $4 trillion market value. Meanwhile, President Trump’s new tariff threats—including a proposed 50% import tax on Brazil and extra tariffs on BRICS nations—are now in focus. As Wall Street prepares for Q2 earnings with Delta Airlines reporting first, investors are balancing excitement around AI stocks with global trade uncertainty. The Nasdaq hit a record high, but attention now turns to jobless claims and the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.

Title: Forbes Daily: Nvidia Reaches A $4 Trillion Milestone

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI juggernaut Nvidia just crossed another milestone: a $4 trillion valuation, the largest in history. The firm, which was worth just over $10 billion a decade ago, now outranks household names like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in training advanced artificial intelligence programs. It’s hard to grasp just how much money $4 trillion is, but for some context: The company of less than 40,000 people is now worth more than 97% of the world’s economies, the entire New York area real estate market and the combined net worth of the 30 richest people in the world. Linda Yaccarino X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation Wednesday, just one day after Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok made a series of antisemitic comments on the social media platform—though a source told NBC News that the exit has been in the works for over a week. On X, Musk wrote: “Thank you for your contributions,” in response to the former advertising executive’s departure after a two-year stint leading the company. It’s unclear who will succeed her. MORE: Later Wednesday night, xAI launched the latest and most advanced version of its AI model: Grok 4. In a nearly hour-long livestream, Musk and xAI staffers demoed the new model, which Musk said was “smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously.” The billionaire did not address Grok’s recent controversial posts. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Good news for investors eagerly awaiting lower borrowing costs: Most Federal Reserve officials still expect interest rate cuts this year, according to minutes released from its recent meeting, but tariffs could complicate the Fed’s efforts to fight price increases. Still, many members of the central bank’s rate-setting panel noted that the inflationary impacts of tariffs could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon. As President Donald Trump suggested he’d implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, the price of the metal skyrocketed in its largest intraday surge since the 1980s, before paring back some of its gains Wednesday. The levies would likely increase prices for copper in the U.S., analysts predicted, as just over half of the total refined copper consumed in the U.S. is imported. MORE: Higher copper costs could also lead to an increase in crime, as the metal would become a valuable target for thieves. It’s the third-most consumed metal in the U.S., with uses ranging from electrical wiring in buildings to computers and cars, and is often stolen from construction sites. Critics of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” argue that it takes from the poor to benefit the wealthy, but not all billionaires are celebrating its passage. Some of the bill’s measures are more likely to help multi-millionaires than billionaires, and a number of the world’s richest people are concerned about the expected $3.4 trillion that will be added to the deficit by 2034 as a result of the legislation. One estate planning attorney told Forbes some of his billionaire clients are moving more of their wealth offshore to “more stable economies.” Adam Valkin, who helped grow General Catalyst into a global venture capital powerhouse, wants to help Israeli founders break into the U.S. market in his new role at Vine Ventures. Valkin will help the firm invest in the country known as “Startup Nation,” as—despite experiencing a drop in investments after the October 7 attack—Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion so far in 2025. After Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital received swift backlash for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a letter supporting the venture capital firm partner garnered hundreds of signatures. The letter defending Maguire claims his remarks, including accusing Mamdani of being an “Islamist,” did not constitute hate speech, even as nearly 1,000 tech founders demanded Sequoia take disciplinary action. Carlo Ancelotti Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been sentenced to one year in prison and will pay a hefty fine after being found guilty of tax fraud. He had been accused of failing to pay over $1.1 million in Spanish taxes related to image rights. Managing Real Madrid is a big deal in the world of professional sports—the team topped Forbes’ list of The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams in 2025, the fourth year in a row it ranked No. 1. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s wildcard entry into the Hall of Fame Open tennis tournament ended in swift defeat Wednesday, drawing criticism from fans and officials who questioned whether the hedge fund manager had earned his spot in the professional event. Participants in the tournament are typically selected based on ATP rankings, wildcard entries and qualifiers. Randy Walker, the director for the Vero Beach Futures tennis tournament, posted on X after the match: “I just watched the absolute worst professional tennis match I have ever seen.” Photo by Matt Roth for The Washington Post via Getty Images Even as child care remains a major hurdle for many working parents, few companies are taking advantage of a federal tax break given to firms that provide child care for their employees, according to IRS data. But the just-signed tax and budget bill includes a little-known provision that more than triples the Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit, and data shows that child care benefits are helping companies’ bottom lines. Les Wexner Five years ago, Ohio’s most revered entrepreneur Les Wexner stepped down as chairman of L Brands and soon began to sell off his stake in the Victoria’s Secret parent company amid controversy over his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Many believed that Wexner, then age 82, would quietly retire. Instead, the fashion mogul has more than doubled his fortune thanks in large part to some savvy bets in a different industry: technology. Over just the past three months, his net worth—which includes assets held in his children’s and wife Abigail’s names—has soared to $10.1 billion from $7.9 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates. The biggest driver of this increase: a 4% stake in CoreWeave, one of the buzziest artificial intelligence companies. On Monday, CoreWeave announced it is buying crypto miner Core Scientific in a roughly $9 billion all-stock deal. CoreWeave’s market capitalization has almost tripled since its March IPO to nearly $73 billion today, and Wexner’s stake is now worth $2.8 billion. The eight-year-old CoreWeave helps companies build data centers and loans out cloud access to much-sought-after graphics processing units, or GPUs, which firms like Microsoft, IBM and Meta pay to use to build AI models. With no shortage of customers, the company recorded $982 million in revenue during the first quarter of this year, a 420% increase versus the same quarter last year. However, it’s yet to turn a profit and reported a net loss of $315 million during the same period. WHY IT MATTERS “After originally making a fortune in fashion, Wexner has become one of the biggest (and most unlikely) winners of the AI gold rush,” says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. “In addition to becoming an early backer of the $73 billion (market cap) CoreWeave, one of the buzziest AI companies around, Wexner's real estate development firm has played a crucial role in bringing big tech players like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel to Central Ohio.” MORE How Victoria’s Secret Billionaire Owner Accidentally Scored A $800 Million Stake In An AI Unicorn Millions of borrowers will soon be on the hook for thousands of extra dollars as the Trump Administration is slated to start charging interest next month on student loans under the Biden-era SAVE plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have had their loans in forbearance since last summer while it’s been held up in court: About 7.84 million: The number of borrowers with loans under the SAVE plan that will be affected by the change $3,500: The amount in additional interest per year that the average borrower enrolled in the SAVE plan will be charged, which works out to about $300 per month 1.5 million: How many applicants for income-driven repayment plans were yet to be processed, the Education Department said in a June court filing Many employees have experienced “quiet firing,” where a manager makes a work environment so unpleasant that it pushes people to quit. Sometimes quiet firing occurs because a boss isn’t doing their job, or it could just be part of the company culture—it’s an easier way for firms to reduce headcount without very public layoffs. If you’ve been silently pushed out, try not to take it personally: You deserve a workplace that supports your growth.

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, climbing thanks to a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto and Wall Street piling into bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—with a “huge” BlackRock ETF bombshell suddenly appearing on the horizon. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that some think could be about to flow into bitcoin and crypto, a closely-watched Wall Street analyst has predicted the “floodgates” are about to open for crypto ETFs.

More predicting the bitcoin rally could be just getting started. The bitcoin and crypto ETF landscape is braced for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds and create a "framework" that would make the approval process for future crypto ETF applications much quicker, according to a report by The Block that cited an anonymous source. "Then we will see the floodgates open on these other assets, but that’s what I’m waiting for," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on an X Spaces broadcast, adding he expects a draft of the framework could emerge as soon as this month, with implementation possible by September or October. The SEC, which has pivoted from being hostile to bitcoin and crypto under the Biden administration to pro-crypto under Trump, has issued new guidance this month on disclosure requirements for exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies, described by Reuters as “the first step toward approval of dozens of applications for ETFs linked to everything from solana and XRP to president Donald Trump’s eponymous meme coin.” "The SEC is moving forward on creating a framework for how they’d like to see all these crypto assets included in investment funds" to address the "explosion" in the number of ETFs now awaiting a regulatory verdict, Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, told the newswire.

More per bitcoin. “What we’re seeing is a long-overdue recalibration from speculation to structural adoption as mandates are being rewritten around digital assets,” Ryan Chow, cofounder of bitcoin finance platform Solv Protocol, said in emailed comments. “Bitcoin’s new all-time high is a signal of growing institutional maturity and global confidence in crypto as an asset class.” BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.2 million bitcoin worth around $140 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $77 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

The silicon valley chip maker briefly topped a record-breaking $4 trillion valuation. Nvidia has seen a consistent rise over the past two years, as enthusiasm for AI-powered tech continues. Shortly after the US stock market opened on Wednesday morning, Nvidia's stock price surged to $164.42. This pushed it briefly to a valuation of $4 trillion, a market value greater than the GDP of France, the UK, or India. The success at the Californian chip company has been helping the wider stock market recover after a downturn in April, partly prompted by US President Donald Trump announcing widespread tariffs. Trump's ongoing trade war sent global markets plummeting. Nvidia, led by Taiwan-born Jensen Huang, has seen a consistent rise over the past two years as this enthusiasm over AI has boomed. Many big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, have also joined the multi-billion dollar AI race. "The market has an incredible certainty that AI is the future," Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers told AFP news agency. "Nvidia is certainly the company most positioned to benefit from that gold rush." In early 2025, Nvidia and generative AI such as OpenAI were challenged by the arrival of China-based DeepSeek. DeepSeek disrupted the AI world with a low-cost, high-performance model. Nvidia lost some $600 billion in market valuation in a single trading session at that time. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video After Trump's tariffs hit the tech sector hard in April, Nvidia quickly bounced back. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of nearly $19 billion despite a $4.5 billion hit from US government export controls which limit chip sales to China. In May, the company reached a deal to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, during a Trump state visit. "We've seen the administration using Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip," said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research. Even as Trump has announced new tariffs in recent days, US stocks have remained high, with the tech-centered Nasdaq closing at a new record on Wednesday. Shares in Nvidia closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3.972 trillion. Edited by: Elizabeth Schumacher

Edited excerpts: Your views on the broader markets? In terms of broader market performance, we are in a volatile phase with low returns over the past year. Although markets have rallied over the last couple of months, if we look at the last one-year returns, it’s a low single-digit number. One can attribute this to expensive valuations and a slowdown in the economy. We didn’t see a massive correction, which typically happens when markets are expensive, as, structurally, India stays one of the most preferred markets from a long-term perspective. India, being the fastest-growing economy, has fiscal checks in place, and even if one looks at the corporate sector, we are seeing one of the lowest levels of debt/equity. Even the banking sector is at its lowest levels of NPAs. This gives confidence to the investors from a long-term perspective. With stronger balance sheets, fiscal stability and liquidity measures from the RBI, the growth should recover, leading to double-digit earnings growth over the next two-three years. Given the current high valuations in the Indian market, do you see room for further upside? Where are the opportunities? Despite the current expensive valuations, we believe the Indian market still holds significant upside in the longer term. We are likely to see a return to double-digit earnings growth, driven by strong corporate balance sheets, robust asset quality in the banking sector and positive liquidity measures from the RBI. The credit growth, which was in the high teens last year, has come down to a high single-digit number now. While we might experience sideways movement in the near term, the structural factors supporting the economy make the market attractive for long-term investors. How is Tata Asset Management positioning its equity portfolios given the global uncertainties — geopolitical risks and rate movements? Given the global uncertainties, the markets have remained volatile. While the Indian market has had sideways movement and low returns over the past few quarters, we continue to see India as an attractive investment destination. This is because of the strength of the banking sector, the stability of corporate balance sheets and fiscal policy measures that are in place. The RBI has also been injecting a lot of liquidity into the system to propel credit growth, which was seeing some slowdown. Despite these short-term challenges, these structural factors support a long-term positive outlook. Have you observed any notable shifts in investor preferences — for example, increased appetite for passive funds or international exposure? The focus is on long-term market potential. Investors should consider India’s growth trajectory when making investment decisions, and with the attractiveness of India as an investment destination, we can assume there may be a growing appetite for exposure to Indian equity markets, including potentially through passive funds. Passive is becoming one of the choices for investors along with active funds. One of the funds you handle is pharma & healthcare... How do you see tariffs or threat of tariff from the US impacting this sector? How prepared are you? When one analyses the India pharma exports from the US perspective, India has a very strategic presence, with: the highest number of USFDA-approved plants in India, creating such a large eco-system can take multiple years; a large volume share in the US oral pharma market today — can be pegged anywhere between 60 and 75 per cent. But when we look at it from India’s perspective, Indian companies selling in the US market are not generating remarkably high ROE/ROCEs in their generic supplies, except for a few one-time opportunities, which may not last long. Hence, any significant pressure on the margins of Indian companies due to the tariff might push them to calibrate their US market strategy. In our pharma fund, we have moved towards higher exposure to healthcare names, given the comfort on growth and outlook. Pharma stocks, at the same time, have seen a decent run over the last year and the valuations are trading higher vs the long-term average. You largely handle sectoral themes. Throw some light on that. I manage diversified funds as well as a technology theme fund. The IT sector has seen a sharp correction over the last six months, due to concerns in the US economy. Enterprise in the US had cut on the discretionary spends since 2022 due to higher inflation, increasing interest rates and the fear of a slowdown in the macros in the US. These concerns are continuing due to the tariff uncertainties, leading to the third year of lower growth for the IT services companies. However, the correction has driven the valuation to a reasonable level, and the sector can see some re-rating if the growth outlook improves. From a sell-side analyst to buy-side, how is your transmission now? I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for esteemed organisations in the industry, both on the buy side as well as the sell side. A sell-side role helps you with building deep expertise in specific industries and sharpening analytical skills, while on the buy-side, it helps with adding more dimensions to these skills by looking at multiple sectors instead of focusing on any single industry. The buy-side industry also helps build critical thinking and decision-making capabilities. Published on July 10, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

July 10, 2025 05:54 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Counter-UAS (C-UAS) Systems - Market and Technology Forecast to 2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This study examines, analyses, and predicts the evolution of C-UAS technologies, markets, and outlays (expenditures) over the 2025-2033 period in the aerospace industry. It also examines markets geographically, focusing on the top 95% of global markets, in the North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Throughout the report, we show how C-UAS systems are used today to add real value, as well as how will they can evolve in the near and distant future. To provide the most thorough and realistic forecast, this report considers all stated and derived scenarios. C-UAS systems are designed to detect, track, and neutralize unmanned aerial systems (UAS), performing the full spectrum of counter-drone operations. These platforms integrate a variety of sensors and mitigation tools to address specific mission requirements. Upon identifying a drone threat, a C-UAS system can respond using either soft-kill or hard-kill techniques. Soft-kill methods disrupt or take control of a drone without physical damage - forcing it to land, return to base, or enabling an operator to seize control. Hard-kill methods involve physically disabling or destroying the drone, often using kinetic or directed energy weapons to neutralize the threat. The market players include large as well as mid to small sized companies with expertise in manufacturing and system integration. The C-UAS market is at a nascent stage. The key factors driving the market are increasing deployment of drones for illicit reasons as well as rising drone warfare in areas of border tensions. In order to keep up with the evolving nature of threats from drone technologies, the technology required behind countermeasures for detection, tracking and mitigation of drones is becoming increasingly sophisticated. From radio waves to electro-optic/infrared to direct energy weapons, various effectors are being tested in different combinations to be integrated on C-UAS systems. Additionally, high-powered computing with integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) over 5G network is estimated to be a significant part in addressing the complex drone threats. These technological innovations will drive the spending in the market as they make the systems more efficient in addressing the threats and provide security to life and infrastructure against UAS attacks.

Title: Ethereum outshines Bitcoin, but ETH’s ATH still out of reach – Why?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-outshines-bitcoin-but-eths-ath-still-out-of-reach-why/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T09:00:55Z
Full Content:
Ethereum is spinning up like a quiet tornado, but still waiting to break free. Zooming in, Ethereum [ETH] seems to be charting its bull path as risk appetite returns. It’s up nearly 30% in under three weeks, about 3x Bitcoin’s [BTC] gains over the same period. The ETH/BTC pair echoes this rotation with a 20% surge, amplified by Bit Digital’s move to swap 280 BTC for ETH, signaling growing investor conviction. Altogether, Ethereum’s Q3 is off to a strong start, echoing its Q2 trend where it outperformed Bitcoin by 1.2x. And yet, the price still hasn’t fully priced in this momentum shift, even as Bitcoin enters price discovery. Ethereum’s market dominance is edging back toward the 10% mark, placing its valuation around $347 billion. Still, it remains a distant second to Bitcoin’s commanding 60%+ market share. The divergence isn’t random. Since breaking into six figures, Bitcoin has notched three fresh all-time highs, the latest peaking at $111,936 on the 9th of July. In contrast, Ethereum hasn’t posted a $3k close in over five months, still trading 43% below its 2021 ATH of $4,891. And despite recent strength, the ETH/BTC ratio remains heavily suppressed, having yet to recover even 50% from its five-year low of 0.018 posted in early Q2. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Even so, Q2 felt like a shift. For the first time since the 2021 cycle, ETH outpaced BTC in quarterly performance. And this outperformance wasn’t a random bounce. Institutional allocation into Ethereum is hitting escape velocity. Five publicly visible treasury holders now control 240,000 ETH, Trump’s disclosed crypto portfolio is 95% ETH, and BlackRock now commands 42% of market share with $4.45 billion in ETH holdings. That’s a textbook setup for a supply-side squeeze. And yet, price action still lags, leaving the market to question whether Ethereum’s breakout is the beginning of its structural shift, or just another temporary blip in a Bitcoin-dominated cycle. Ethereum’s breakout case is building. Price has cleanly breached the $2,815 resistance, with momentum eyeing a test of $3,000. If the structure holds, upside continuation is in play. But the catch is, can ETH decouple if BTC slips? So far, evidence says no. Despite stronger fundamentals and ecosystem growth, ETH remains cycle-bound to Bitcoin. Even in May, while Etheruem consolidated and Bitcoin pulled back from all-time highs, ETH still underperformed sharply, dropping 24%, twice the drawdown of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Critics argue Ethereum faces an identity dilemma, torn between being a utility protocol or a growth asset, unlike Bitcoin’s clean monetary pitch. Since December, Ethereum has seen major protocol upgrades, yet on-chain demand remains flat. Unless ETH breaks this structural correlation with BTC, a new all-time high stays out of reach.

Title: Bitwise Says the Next Trillion-Dollar Crypto Wave Could Start With These 4 Tokens

The growing crypto push toward on-chain financial assets is drawing attention from institutional investors and analysts. According to a recent client note from Bitwise Asset Management, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Chainlink (LINK) may be among the most direct beneficiaries of the emerging tokenization narrative. The report suggests that the surge in blockchain-based representations of stocks, bonds, and other real-world assets (RWAs) is no longer theoretical and could begin influencing crypto prices sooner than previously expected. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen outlined this perspective in their latest analysis. They argue that while tokenization has long been considered a future trend, recent milestones suggest the infrastructure and momentum needed to support adoption are already materializing. In the last month alone, Robinhood and crypto exchange Kraken have introduced tokenized stock trading platforms, built on crypto networks such as Arbitrum and Solana, respectively. Though currently limited to non-US users, Coinbase has also filed with the SEC to bring tokenized equities to the US market. Simultaneously, financial institutions invested $135 million into the Canton Network, a Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for trading tokenized stocks and bonds. Participants in the round included Tradeweb, Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and DTCC, signaling institutional buy-in. These advancements come amid regulatory support, as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins labeled tokenization a significant innovation and suggested a pivot from punitive enforcement to proactive development. At the same time, real-world applications continue to emerge. One of Latin America’s largest exchanges announced a $200 million tokenization initiative on the XRP Ledger, and Galaxy Digital warned tokenization could eventually impact traditional exchanges like the NYSE. Collectively, these moves point to a shift in how financial markets could operate going forward. Bitwise’s report suggests that ETH, SOL, XRP, and LINK stand out as “clean” investment vehicles to gain exposure to the tokenization trend. Ethereum’s role as the foundation for Arbitrum, Solana’s adoption by Kraken, the XRP Ledger’s use in real-world asset programs, and Chainlink’s role in connecting off-chain data to smart contracts make them logical candidates for long-term inclusion. The note also emphasizes that diversifying across these crypto networks may be more effective than backing a single protocol. The analysts further referenced BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who in his 2024 shareholder letter asserted that “every asset can be tokenized.” With global stock and bond markets representing a combined $257 trillion, the total addressable market for tokenization is substantial. The Bitwise analysts added that even modest adoption, 1% to 5% penetration, could translate into trillions of dollars flowing through blockchain ecosystems. Bitwise’s conclusion: the tokenization narrative, once considered speculative, may already be shaping the next major cycle in crypto markets.

Title: Serial winner Gus McCarthy planning to carry his happy habit into the Ireland fold
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/07/10/serial-winner-gus-mccarthy-planning-to-carry-his-happy-habit-into-the-ireland-fold/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Gus McCarthy has never been on the losing side in a Test match or a Champions Cup game. It is a striking statistic for the 21-year-old Leinster and Ireland hooker. On Saturday he will look to maintain that record when Ireland take on Portugal in Lisbon (7pm Irish time). He has played 20 matches in senior professional rugby and suffered defeat just twice, both in United Rugby Championship (URC) games. McCarthy is a serial winner. He led his school, Blackrock College, to a Leinster Schools Senior Cup crown. He captained the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations grand slam and a place in the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to a brilliant French team. McCarthy’s progression from Leinster to Ireland debuts came in just under six months, via an Emerging Ireland tour. The ACL injury suffered by Dan Sheehan in July 2024 provided an opening, which the young hooker followed up on. He scored a try in his first cap against Fiji last November, provided an assist for three others and finished the match in the backrow because of injuries. The Leinster man then followed up with another try-scoring cameo in the 22-19 victory over Australia. McCarthy won two further caps off the bench in the Six Nations. That was a major achievement in itself as the two players ahead of him at Leinster and Ireland are currently away with the Lions − Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher. McCarthy said of his rapid rise from rookie to the Test environment: “I’ve been delighted with the opportunities I’ve got, but obviously I’m in Leinster and it’s a very, very tough challenge. I’ve got two probable Lions Test players in the same position as me. “I haven’t played a whole amount. I didn’t really get involved in any of the URC knockout stages and the latter end of the Champions Cup, but I did get quite a bit of game time in the middle of the season. It’s good to learn from the best, some seriously good talent. The competition is endless; it keeps you on your toes. “I wouldn’t say it’s frustrating. Obviously, I would like to play but I’m still very inexperienced. I try to take every opportunity I get and just bide my time.” He smiles when the word “meteoric” is mentioned. “It did happen sooner than I would have thought. I thought I was just going to be training for the first week of Portugal (in November) but then I got held on. “For the week of the Argentina game, I was back with Leinster and then I thought I was done, but I got the call on the Sunday night asking me to come into camp again and then I got named to start in that Fiji match. I wasn’t expecting it, but I was delighted to get a shot.” He was part of an Irish front-row alongside Jack Boyle (2) and Thomas Clarkson (6) that had a combined 12 caps when Ireland faced into last week’s Test in Tbilisi. Whatever about the callow nature of the team, squaring up against Georgia in a scrum is not for the fainthearted. It is a rigorous technical examination. While Ireland did experience issues initially in that facet of the game, they successfully worked their way through them and won the game 34-5. So, what was the scrum Test like? “I really enjoyed the experience of playing against that Georgian pack,” he said. “The Georgians are known for being a seriously strong scrum, big front-row, abrasive players. It was a great test for us as a young and relatively inexperienced pack. Everything wasn’t perfect but I think we did a good job and got stuck into them physically.” Saturday will provide a contrasting test, fast and loose in the sweltering temperatures of Lisbon and a Portugal side that will engage Ireland in a different way to Georgia. McCarthy can’t wait. He’s where he loves to be, in the match environment. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Bitcoin hits record high of $112,055; crypto stocks rally in response
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-of-112055-crypto-stocks-rally-in-response/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T03:27:36Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has once again smashed through its previous records, surging past the $112,000 mark for the first time in its history to set a new all-time high on July 9. The milestone represents a significant achievement for the leading cryptocurrency as it continues to recover from the market aftershocks of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and solidifies its position in an evolving financial landscape. As the broader crypto market continues its recovery, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new record high of $112,055 on Tuesday. This fresh peak surpasses the previous all-time high of $111,970.17, which was set on May 22. The digital asset has been trading in a volatile range since then, with the area around the $110,000 level proving to be a significant psychological and technical barrier. Over the past several weeks, each time Bitcoin’s price neared this level, it was met with a combination of profit-taking from existing holders and increased pressure from short-sellers. This latest decisive break suggests a new wave of bullish momentum has taken hold. The journey of Bitcoin, first introduced in a 2008 white paper by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been remarkable. Launched in 2009 as the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency, it has grown to become the largest digital asset, with a current market capitalization of $2.18 trillion. At the time of this report, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 65% of the total crypto market capitalization of $3.4 trillion. From crossing the $100 mark in April 2013 to the $1,000 mark in November of that same year, its path has been marked by staggering growth. It first hit the $10,000 level in November 2017 and reached a memorable peak of $69,000 in November 2021. Following President Trump’s victory in his second presidential election, it set a new all-time high of $76,999 in early November 2024, before crossing the landmark $100,000 target in early December 2024. A key factor underpinning Bitcoin’s current strength is its growing acceptance within the traditional financial system. With the Trump administration signaling its validation of Bitcoin through its plan to create a strategic US Bitcoin reserve, and with the continued institutional adoption led by Wall Street giants such as BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the “king coin” appears to have found a more secure home, at least for now, within the US financial ecosystem. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, a prime example of this institutional integration, now currently owns 3.5% of the total supply of Bitcoin. The success of this and other spot Bitcoin ETFs has had a profound effect on institutional investment and has likely influenced the broader market optimism. While the new all-time high is a headline-grabbing event, some market watchers have noted that the build-up to this moment has been relatively slow and quiet, which they interpret as a potentially bullish setup for what’s to come. “Crypto feels so quiet, [while] bitcoin is ready to move,” wrote Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report. Morris pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility has been steadily declining, a pattern that has historically preceded large upward price movements. This sentiment was reflected in the performance of crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR) were higher by 4.4%, trading at $414, just a few dollars shy of its highest level in 2025 (though still well below its record high of $543 set late last year). Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) was ahead by 5%, and Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were both up by roughly 6%, all riding the wave of Bitcoin’s record-breaking achievement.

Title: Seattle Startup Backed By Khosla Ventures Charges $10,000 For 'Blood Cleaning' That Claims To Make You Biologically 2.61 Years Younger

Time Published: 2025-07-10T00:30:48Z
Full Content:
Longevity startup Circulate Health announced Wednesday that it has raised $12 million in seed funding to expand a pricey outpatient service it calls ‘targeted blood cleaning.' The treatment, known as therapeutic plasma exchange, removes a patient's blood, separates the liquid plasma, and then returns the blood cells with a replacement fluid. Circulate Health says this process clears out inflammation and biological compounds linked to aging. According to GeekWire, the procedure costs between $8,000 and $10,000 per session and is not covered by insurance. Since May 2024, the Seattle-based company says it has completed over 1,000 treatments in eight states through a network of 24 clinics. Don't Miss: Today's Best Finance Deals Circulate Health co-founder and CEO Dr. Brad Younggren told GeekWire that they "saw a lot of expected outcomes that would be consistent with cellular rejuvenation." A study published in Aging Cell by Circulate Health and Buck Institute for Research on Aging observed 42 participants, with one group receiving six plasma exchanges plus a dose of antibodies. That group experienced a 2.61-year average reduction in biological age, according to the company. However, the trial lasted only three to five months, and experts say more research is needed. Dr. Jeffrey Winters, chair of transfusion medicine at the Mayo Clinic, told the New York Times that the findings do not show the therapy leads to longer or healthier lives. The study's final blood samples showed diminishing effects, suggesting that any benefit may taper off over time. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Circulate Health operated in stealth for two years and officially launched in January 2024 when Younggren joined as CEO. According to GeekWire, his co-founder is Dr. Eric Verdin, CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. Khosla Ventures led the $12 million seed round, joined by Seaside Ventures and CSC Ventures. Robbie Schwietzer, former chief product officer at 98point6, also joined the Circulate Health team as chief operating officer, GeekWire says. “We incubated Circulate to explore whether a safe, well-understood therapy like therapeutic plasma exchange could counter the deleterious effects of aging, and offer broader health benefits like potentially removing microplastics from the body,” Khosla Ventures partner Alex Morgan said in the statement. “Early clinical results are promising, and we’re excited to continue backing the team as they work to make therapeutic plasma exchange more accessible to more people.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now The U.S. longevity tech market has pulled in $1.8 billion in investment since 2021, according to PitchBook. In 2024 alone, startups in the space raised nearly $300 million as investors doubled down on areas like epigenetic reprogramming and senolytics, fields targeting the root causes of aging rather than just its symptoms. Backed by visionaries such as Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman, PitchBook says the sector is gaining momentum despite regulatory uncertainty and long development timelines. Circulate Health's competitors include MaxWell Clinic and Next Health, both offering similar treatments. The difference, Circulate Health claims, according to Geekwire, lies in their replacement fluid: albumin instead of saline, and the addition of targeted antibodies. Younggren said their method aims to improve longevity outcomes beyond what traditional plasma donation protocols offer. While the treatment remains expensive and uncovered by insurance, Younggren believes it could help prevent costly chronic illness down the line. "This notion of making America healthy again fits right in with what we're trying to do," Younggren told GeekWire.

Title: Rex-Osprey spot Solana ETF doubles cumulative inflows to $41M on July 8
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/rex-osprey-spot-solana-etf-doubles-cumulative-inflows-to-41m-on-july-8/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:18Z
Full Content:
Despite the increase, the net inflow amount represents 0.05% of Solana's total market cap, well below the proportions registered by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The first US-listed spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) received $21 million of net inflows on July 8, lifting its running total to $41.2 million, based on Farside Investors’ data. The one-day addition to the Rex-Osprey’s Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) 104% of the $20.2 million raised over the previous three trading sessions, effectively doubling net inflows. [Editor’s Note: SSK isn’t a pure spot ETF. At least 40% of its assets are allocated to other Solana ETFs, primarily issued outside the U.S., with the remainder directly invested in Solana. This structure was approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, differing from the approval route of the infamous spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Solana ETFs. These applications are currently under review.] SSK began trading on July 2 with a 0.75% management fee, triple the 0.25% headline charge that BlackRock and Fidelity levy on their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. Comparing the first four trading days for each asset class reveals a disconnect between the flows and the market capitalization of the underlying assets. Bitcoin spot ETFs earned about $2.9 billion during their first four sessions in January, which is roughly 0.34% of BTC’s market capitalization at the time. Ethereum spot ETFs absorbed almost $1.2 billion over their opening quartet in late June, or 0.3% of Ether’s market value once Grayscale’s legacy outflows are stripped out, per the same dataset. By contrast, Solana’s $41.2 million equates to approximately 0.05% of SOL’s circulating supply, roughly 16.7% of the penetration level achieved by the earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum launches. One reason for the divergence is the cost. Rex-Osprey’s 0.75% levy ranks as the highest among US spot crypto ETFs, while its seed inventory of just $600,000 suggests limited authorized participant warehousing capacity. Fidelity and BlackRock launched their Bitcoin funds with seed baskets exceeding $300 million and fee-waiver schedules that decreased to 0.12% and 0.20% during the first year. Furthermore, Rex-Osprey remains the sole issuer of Solana ETFs that directly hold SOL. While the small base and higher expense ratio leave SSK’s early intake below that of its large-cap counterparts, the fund’s doubling on July 8 shows an incremental appetite from allocators undeterred by cost.

Title: Institutions Buy Bitcoin In Record Numbers, But Why Is Price Still Below $111,900 ATH?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/institutions-buy-large-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:09Z
Full Content:
Institutions like BlackRock and Metaplanet continue to actively accumulate Bitcoin, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. BTC has, however, remained below its current all-time high (ATH) due to factors such as tariffs and selling pressure from old whales. SosoValue data shows that BlackRock has officially surpassed the 700,000 BTC milestone and now holds $76.35 billion in assets under management (AuM). The asset manager’s Bitcoin holdings account for 3.5% of the crypto’s total supply of 21 million. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is now way ahead of Saylor’s Strategy and the second-largest Bitcoin holder, behind Satoshi Nakamoto. BlackRock has achieved this milestone in less than two years since its Bitcoin ETF launched. Commenting on this milestone, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the asset manager now holds 700,000 BTC and is 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi. The Bloomberg analyst added that IBIT has on average accumulated 40,000 BTC a month or 1,300 BTC a day. Based on this pace, the asset manager is on course to 1.2 million BTC in May 2026. Besides BlackRock, Metaplanet is another institution that is actively accumulating Bitcoin in record numbers. The company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, announced that they have acquired 2,205 BTC for $238.7 million at $108,237 per bitcoin, achieving a BTC yield of 416.6% YTD. Metaplanet now holds 15,555 BTC, which it acquired for $1.54 billion at $99,307 per bitcoin. BitcoinTreasuries’ data shows that Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest Bitcoin treasury company, only behind Strategy, MARA, Twenty One Capital, and Riot platforms. Other companies like MARA Holdings, Semler Scientific, and ProCap BTC have also expanded their Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting the massive demand for the flagship crypto. Macro factors like the Trump tariffs continue to pose an obstacle to a new uptrend for the Bitcoin price. The US president recently sparked panic in the markets with his trade letters, which he sent to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, imposing a reciprocal tariff on them. These tariffs are set to take effect from August 1, and Trump has declared that he has no intention to extend the trade deadline again. The Bitcoin price dropped from its weekly high above $109,000 amid this development and is again at risk of reaching new weekly lows. The BTC price also looks to be facing selling pressure from old whales, which matches the buying pressure from these institutions. Bloomberg reported that early Bitcoin whales have sold over 500,000 BTC in the past year, which roughly matches the net inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. One early Bitcoin whale also recently moved 80,000 BTC, raising concerns that they were looking to offload these coins. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

(Reuters: Robert Galbraith) Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. The milestone highlights what has been widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since the introduction of the first iPhone 18 years ago. AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. It puts the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $US4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, the milestone marked what is being widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $US1 trillion, $US2 trillion and eventually, $US3 trillion. Technology multinational Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia's rise comes as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone, while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialised chips. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $US325 billion for investments in the technology this year, with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason the company's stock price have increased 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $US400 billion to $US4 trillion. After exceeding $US4 trillion for the first time early on Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $US162.88. But most analysts do not expect the price to stay below $US163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock would climb to $US196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $US4.8 trillion. Jensen Huang's widening fame has been accompanied by a fattening fortune. (AP: Sarah Meyssonnier) Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as "the godfather" of AI, with his dissertations about the technology's direction attracting enraptured audiences. Mr Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $US142 billion. It looked like Nvidia might have hit a road block in early April when US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered a widespread sell-off on the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $US87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by a $US18.8 billion profit, despite a $US4.5 billion hit to account for US government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China. The California company is scheduled to release its next quarterly report on August 27.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares hit a record high Wednesday as the AI investor favorite became the first company ever to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Nvidia shares have risen 88% from their early-April low and are up 20% since the start of the year, boosted by expectations that major technology companies will continue snapping up the chip giant's products as they build out their AI capabilities. Nvidia shares closed Wednesday's session nearly 2% higher at around $163, leaving the market value just shy of the milestone level it briefly surpassed early in the day. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since forming a bullish engulfing pattern in early April, Nvidia shares have trended sharply higher, with the price climbing back above the 50-week moving average (MA) in May on its way toward its recent highs. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, but remains below overbought levels, indicating the shares have more room to test higher prices before consolidating. However, it’s worth pointing out that trading volume has steadily declined during the stock’s move higher in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Let’s apply technical analysis to Nvidia’s chart to forecast how a longer-term uptrend in the stock may play out and also identify key support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast where Nvidia shares may be headed next by applying bars pattern analysis, a tool that analyzes prior trends to project how a future directional move may take shape. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the strong trending period from January to August 2023 and overlay them from the stock’s recent close above the 50-week MA. This projects an upside target of around $300 and indicates the move higher could last until late December this year if a similar trend emerges. We selected this prior trend as it also followed a bullish close above the 50-week SMA and has closely replicated the stock's current price action in recent weeks. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $130 level. The shares could find support in this area near the upward sloping 50-week MA and a trendline that connects a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to June last year. Finally, the bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level could see Nvidia shares fall to lower support around $97. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near the prominent March 2024 swing high, which sit just above major lows that formed on the chart in August latter that year and April this year.

Title: Delete WhatsApp and Install Signal

Time Published: 2025-07-09T22:15:56Z

Andrew Steele WhatsApp is the world's most popular instant messaging service, and it's owned by Meta—the same company behind Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. If you value your privacy and digital security, I strongly recommend removing all of these apps from your phone. If there are any you absolutely can't live without, at minimum revoke every permission you can to protect yourself from the serious privacy and security risks these apps pose. The best alternative to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is Signal, which offers genuinely private and secure messaging. Signal encrypts all your messages and metadata, meaning Signal itself knows almost nothing about you. Crucially, it's run by a nonprofit organisation, not a corporation whose entire business model depends on harvesting your personal data to sell targeted advertising. For Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, you're far safer accessing them through your web browser rather than installing their apps. Even if most of your contacts use WhatsApp, you can make a difference by encouraging the people you contact the most to move to Signal. If most of your messages are on Signal—and then likely the most sensitive ones too—you can start to take back your privacy. And secondly, if we all start to do this, it will mean more people are on Signal, hopefully gradually making it more attractive to move across! If you don't read any further, this is the short version: Delete Meta's apps, use Signal for messaging, and access social media through your browser instead. While WhatsApp claims* your message contents are end-to-end encrypted, Meta extensively collects the 'metadata' around your conversations. This includes who you message, when you message them, how often you communicate, and your location data. WhatsApp's privacy policy states that the app collects extensive usage logs, including the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This metadata collection creates a detailed profile of your most private relationships and activities. If you message your therapist, doctor, lawyer, or visit sensitive locations like medical clinics, Meta instantly knows something deeply personal about you—information that could be legally or personally compromising. Even worse, they scan your entire contact list to build social networks of people who may not even use Meta's services, creating detailed profiles of individuals who never consented to this data collection. * Because WhatsApp is ‘closed-source’, we can’t examine the code to check their claims. However, given that you can report messages to Meta for violating the terms of use, they clearly do have mechanisms to read messages. Signal, on the other hand, is ‘open-source’, meaning that anyone can read the source code, and independent experts have verified that it’s private and secure. Meta's track record on privacy is…not great. Here are some of their most egregious violations: Meta allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, which was then used to manipulate political campaigns. The company was fined $5 billion by the FTC for this breach—yet their stock price actually went up after the fine was announced, showing how little these penalties actually deter such behaviour. Between September 2024 and early June 2025, Meta's Android apps (Facebook and Instagram) covertly tracked users' web browsing, even in incognito mode, or if using a VPN. Meta used this method without obtaining consent from users, linking browsing history to Facebook and Instagram profiles. This tracking was so invasive that even Google called it abusive. The fact that Meta was willing to engage in such underhanded data collection means that simply having one of their apps on your phone poses a serious privacy and security risk. Facebook used phone numbers that users provided for security purposes (like two-factor authentication) for advertising targeting—a direct violation of user trust and their stated privacy policies. And, just a few weeks ago, WhatsApp started asking users to add their email address ‘for extra security’. Uh-huh… Meta now requires you to manually opt out of having your WhatsApp conversations fed to their AI in every single chat you participate in. This feature was rolled out with virtually no fanfare—I discovered this 'feature' by accident, meaning my private conversations had probably already been processed by Meta's AI systems. While Meta claims this is only for local AI features like enhanced search (eg, if you type ‘find me that time Andrew complained about how terrible WhatsApp is for privacy’ into the search bar, and it will dig out that bit of chat), the reality is that training data for AI models is one of the most valuable commodities in tech today. Given Meta’s track record of privacy violations, can you trust them not to use your intimate conversations in their ongoing AI development? The Facebook app now includes a setting asking users to upload every photo on their camera roll to Meta's AI for 'cloud processing' and unspecified 'suggestions'. Think about what's in your photo library: that picture of a rash you took to show the doctor, pictures of your whole family on the beach in swimwear, that snap you took of your passport in case you lose it, screenshots of personal information… Do you really want Meta having access to every image you've ever captured on your phone? And can you be sure that Meta won’t roll out a ‘feature’ like this to their other apps in future? Again, images are a hugely valuably commodity for AI training these days—the incentive is definitely there for Meta to hoover them all up. Meta makes plenty of money from WhatsApp both by using the data it gathers to serve ads on its other platforms and by business accounts paying for certain features. But apparently this isn’t enough, and there are ads directly in WhatsApp now. This is just in the ‘stories’ tab for now—which honestly I don’t use very much—but it really wouldn’t come as a surprise to get a ‘helpful’ suggestion for a pizza place next time I’m telling someone that I’m hungry in a WhatsApp chat…or maybe an ad for a therapist next time I mention I’m not feeling great? When advertising is the primary business model, privacy inevitably takes second place. The safest approach is to completely uninstall all Meta apps from your phone. If you absolutely must keep some for work or social reasons, you can try to limit the risk by doing the following: However, given Meta's willingness to exploit Android vulnerabilities for covert tracking, having any of their apps installed remains a privacy risk. I wish I could delete WhatsApp entirely, but it requires a critical mass of people to make the switch before Signal becomes the default messaging platform. That's where you come in. Try Signal today, and convince your friends and family to join you. It's one of the simplest and most effective actions you can take to protect not just your own privacy, but to help create a more secure digital world for everyone. The choice is clear: continue letting Meta profit from your most intimate communications, or take control of your digital privacy. What will you choose? Your email address will not be published.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose Wednesday as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization and President Trump released letters to more trading partners outlining tariff rates set to take effect on Aug. 1. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, closing just shy of a new record. The Dow ended the midweek session up 0.5%, while outperformance from the tech sector helped the Nasdaq climbed 0.9% to a record closing high. Shares of AES Corp. (AES) skyrocketed 19.8%, leading gains on the S&P 500 following reports that the power generator is exploring a sale. Several major infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit have been evaluating an acquisition of AES amid declines in its share price over the past few years, Bloomberg reported. AES generates energy from a variety of sources, including hydro, wind, and solar, and has signed agreements with multiple tech firms to provide renewable energy for data centers. Reports of a potential takeover bid also helped lift shares of engineering design software firm PTC Inc. (PTC), which surged 17.7%. Bloomberg indicated that rival Autodesk (ADSK), which competes with PTC in the computer-aided design and product lifecycle management markets, is evaluating a potential acquisition. Autodesk shares slipped 2.4%. Major cryptocurrencies moved higher, with the price of Bitcoin hitting a record high around $112,000 amid optimism about a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., advanced 5.4%, adding to a string of recent gains leaving the stock up over 50% since the start of the year. Newly released minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that policymakers believe tariff-related inflationary pressure will be moderate and still anticipate interest-rate cuts in 2025. The projection for potential Fed rate cuts and the likelihood of lower mortgage rates helped lift housing-related stocks. D.R. Horton (DHI) shares gained 5.4% Shares of fellow home builders Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), as well as shares of residential construction supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR), all added around 4.5%. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.7%, a day after the company reported it delivered 150 commercial jets in the second quarter, up from 92 in the year-ago period and ahead of analysts' forecasts. The aviation giant also topped expectations for quarterly deliveries of helicopters and jets in its defense segment. Shares of data analytics firm Fair Isaac (FICO) logged the weakest performance in the S&P 500 for the second straight session, dropping 6.5% Wednesday. The two-day slide came after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, indicated that lenders will be able to evaluate the creditworthiness of mortgage borrowers using the VantageScore system, a competitor to Fair Isaac's FICO credit scores. Hershey (HSY) shares fell 4.7% after the chocolate maker named a new CEO. The confectionery company announced that Kirk Tanner, who currently serves as the top executive for fast-food giant Wendy's (WEN), will take the helm at Hershey starting next month. Tanner is slated to replace retiring Hershey CEO Michele Buck. Rothschild & Co Redburn analysts downgraded Monster Beverage (MNST) stock to "neutral" from "buy," suggesting that tariffs on aluminum imports could weigh on the performance of the energy drink maker. Monster Beverage shares sank 3.3%.

Title: Who Should Avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF? Risks and Drawbacks Explained
URL: https://typeforyou.org/who-should-avoid-the-nasdaq-qqq-etf/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T21:17:37Z
Full Content:
The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is often praised for its outstanding performance, particularly during technology-driven bull markets. Backed by the Nasdaq-100 index, QQQ gives investors exposure to some of the most innovative and fastest-growing companies in the world, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. But while it’s a fan favorite for growth-seeking investors, the Nasdaq QQQ ETF isn’t a one-size-fits-all investment. Lets break down who should avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF, explore its potential risks and limitations, and explain why it’s not suitable for every portfolio. Whether you’re a new investor, a conservative saver, or a retiree managing withdrawals, this guide will help you decide if QQQ belongs in your investment strategy. Contents The Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. This index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It’s heavily weighted in technology, but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare. The fund is widely regarded as a strong option for long-term growth investors. But like any investment, it comes with trade-offs. Before diving into why you might want to avoid it, let’s touch on why many investors love QQQ: But these strengths can quickly turn into weaknesses if they don’t align with your risk tolerance or investment goals. Let’s break down the types of investors who might want to steer clear of QQQ, and the reasons why. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is built for aggressive growth, not stability. It often experiences sharper declines during market downturns due to its high exposure to tech and other volatile sectors. If you’re looking for a safe, low-volatility investment for peace of mind, QQQ likely isn’t the best fit. Investors who are in or approaching retirement usually prioritize capital preservation and income over growth. QQQ’s volatility and low dividend yield make it less suitable for this stage of life. If you’re withdrawing funds regularly, a more conservative, income-focused ETF or bond allocation may be more appropriate. If you follow a value investing strategy—buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals—then QQQ likely doesn’t align with your approach. Value investors often prefer funds that track the Russell 1000 Value Index or individual stocks with low valuations. QQQ is highly concentrated in technology and a few mega-cap stocks. If you’re looking for balanced exposure across sectors, QQQ might not give you what you need. If true diversification is your goal, consider a total market ETF like VTI or a multi-sector portfolio. While QQQ has delivered incredible long-term returns, it can be extremely volatile in the short term. Many traders get in expecting fast profits and panic sell during corrections. If you’re not prepared for the ups and downs, or you’re new to investing, QQQ might lead to losses instead of gains. Aside from being a poor fit for certain investors, there are inherent risks with investing in QQQ. Understanding these helps you make better decisions. QQQ is heavily weighted in a small number of mega-cap tech stocks. If a few of these companies underperform, the entire ETF suffers. With tech dominating the fund, sector-specific downturns (like tech crashes or regulatory crackdowns) can disproportionately hurt performance. QQQ isn’t ideal for income investors. The yield is much lower than broader market ETFs or dividend-focused funds. High-growth tech stocks generally underperform in rising interest rate environments. This makes QQQ vulnerable when rates are hiked. Some of QQQ’s top holdings have high valuation multiples. If earnings fail to meet expectations, prices can fall hard. If QQQ doesn’t align with your goals or risk tolerance, here are some alternatives: Despite the drawbacks, QQQ can still be a great investment for the right investor: The key is understanding the risks and making sure they align with your strategy. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is powerful, but it isn’t perfect. It shines in bull markets and tech rallies, but stumbles during periods of volatility or interest rate hikes. It can be an excellent tool for wealth building—but only if it fits your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. If you’re nearing retirement, seeking income, or prioritizing sector diversification, QQQ may not be for you. Instead, look toward more balanced, conservative ETFs that better match your objectives. Bottom Line: Know your financial goals, understand your risk appetite, and choose investments that align with both. QQQ is not inherently bad it’s just not for everyone.

Title: AI kingpin Nvidia crowned as first public company with a $4 trillion valuation
URL: https://www.wsbtv.com/news/ai-kingpin-nvidia/U4HZMQ2ZOVAF5BJ2TCVOKQR2Q4/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T20:45:49Z

WSB Now SAN FRANCISCO — (AP) — Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia on Wednesday became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market valuation, putting the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, reaching the milestone highlighted the upheaval being unleashed by an AI craze that's widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. Nvidia's rise as come as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI with an array of new features that included a more than year-old promise to smarten up its often bumbling virtual assistant Apple acknowledged last month that delivering on its AI vision is going to take until at least next year, leading some industry analysts to wonder if the company will have to acquire an AI start-up to regain momentum. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined forces with OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialized chips that power the energy-intensive data centers underlying artificial intelligence. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $325 billion for investments in the technology this year — with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason that the company's stock price increased by 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $400 billion to $4 trillion. After exceeding $4 trillion for the first time early Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $162.88. But most analysts don't expect the price to stay below $163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock will climb to $196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $4.8 trillion. Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as “the godfather” of AI, whose dissertations about the technology's direction attract enraptured audiences. Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $142 billion. It looked like Nvidia may have hit a road block in early April when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered widespread selloff in the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by an $18.8 billion profit, despite a $4.5 billion hit to account for U.S. government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China. The Santa Clara, California, company is scheduled to release its next quarterly report on Aug. 27. . Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Nvidia beats Microsoft and Apple to $4 trillion market cap

Some of you may remember that Nvidia posted a very strong quarter in its Q1 FY2026 results. The company raked in $44.1 billion in revenue, which was a 69% increase from the same quarter last year and a 12% bump over the previous quarter. Nvidia has forecasted an even stronger quarter in Q2 FY2026, with revenue figures expected to be at the $45 billion mark. However, ahead of that actually happening, the firm has hit a pretty major milestone. Nvidia has become the first company in the world to achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion after the company's stock price rose by over 2% today, as noted by CNBC. The company has surpassed both Apple and Microsoft in reaching this milestone, which is a major feat considering that both companies hit the $3 trillion market cap ahead of Nvidia. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.7 trillion, Apple is at $3.1 trillion, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is sitting comfortably at $2.1 trillion, and Meta is holding strong at $1.8 trillion. Nvidia's market cap has been boosted by strong demand for its specialized and general purpose hardware during this age of generative AI. The chipmaker really hit its stride after the meteoric growth in popularity of ChatGPT in late 2022. In addition, many companies - like Microsoft - which offer public cloud platforms to their customers rely on Nvidia's hardware for various workloads. That said, Nvidia has faced its fair share of challenges too. A recent U.S. government restriction requires it to utilize new licenses to export H20 products to China, which is expected to cost the firm $8 billion in lost sales. Notably, the $45 billion revenue estimate that Nvidia shared for the current quarter already accounts for this loss, which means that its revenue would have been above $50 billion otherwise. It will be interesting to see if other tech firms are able to catch up to Nvidia or if the chipmaker will continue sailing out of reach.

Title: SEC pushes back decision on in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock Ethereum ETF

Share this article The SEC has extended its timeline to rule on Nasdaq’s proposal to enable BlackRock’s spot Ethereum, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), to offer in-kind creations and redemptions, according to a new filing. The in-kind model under SEC review, which mirrors traditional commodity ETF mechanics, would allow Authorized Participants (APs) to transfer Ethereum (ETH) directly, replacing the current cash-based creation and redemption process to reduce slippage and simplify operations. In practice, APs would be able to deliver actual Ether to the ETF issuer in exchange for new shares, and redeem shares to receive Ether back, rather than settling them in cash. BlackRock submitted an amended S-1 registration statement to the SEC in May, seeking approval to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its ETHA fund. The asset manager is also awaiting a regulatory decision on a similar in-kind model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Other fund managers, including 21Shares, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Bitwise, and VanEck, have also filed to enable in-kind creation and redemption for their crypto ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously said that in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are “definitely coming at some point.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Nvidia's $4 trillion milestone caps rise of stock market behemoth

Business A NVIDIA logo is pictured on its facility at the High-tech park at Yokne'am, in northern Israel Jul 9, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Shir Torem) NEW YORK: The stunning rise of Nvidia to become the first publicly traded company valued at US$4 trillion underscores the massive importance to the stock market of the AI chipmaker and the technology sector. Reaching the lofty milestone caps a massive run for Nvidia's stock price, which has soared some 1,350 per cent since October 2022. This year, the chipmaker's shares are up about 22 per cent against a 6 per cent rise for the S&P 500. The company's market value hit US$4 trillion in morning trading on Wednesday (Jul 9), about 13 months after it had first reached the US$3 trillion milestone. Nvidia's stock surge has given it significant weight in key equity indexes and ETFs that are more heavily influenced by companies with the biggest market values.

Loading At around 7.5 per cent, Nvidia has the biggest weight in the S&P 500, which is widely viewed by investors as the benchmark for the US stock market. The stock has an even greater presence in more tech-heavy measures, such as the popular Invesco QQQ Trust ETF and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index. Its influence is less significant in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is weighted by stock prices as opposed to market values. Nvidia may soon have company in the exclusive US$4 trillion club. Microsoft's market value was hovering around US$3.7 trillion on Wednesday. Apple ranks third at about US$3.1 trillion. Their massive market values also illustrate the hefty influence of tech and tech-related companies. The top seven S&P 500 weights, which also include Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Broadcom, comprise about one-third of the index. Nvidia's gains also point to the increasing presence of the overall technology sector, which is by far the largest sector in the S&P 500. The tech sector's market value has grown to one-third of S&P 500 market value, nearly reaching the proportion that the sector hit during the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000.

Title: Q&A: Will survivors of historical abuse in schools be compensated? And who will be liable?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/07/09/qa-will-survivors-of-historical-abuse-in-schools-be-compensated-and-who-will-be-liable/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T19:04:29Z
Full Content:
The Government has establishment a commission of investigation into historical sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools. What scale of abuse is thought to have occurred? An initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. Most of these allegations were reported from the records of some 42 religious orders that run, or previously ran, schools in the State. When did this abuse occur? The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. What prompted the inquiry in the first place? In a RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys, broadcast in November 2022, brothers Mark and David Ryan outlined how they had both been sexually abused at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College in the 1970s, discovering each other’s abuse there only in 2002. The broadcast prompted a public outcry and a surge in allegations of abuse, mostly in religious-run day and boarding schools. Are just religious schools the subject of a scoping inquiry? No – it is all schools. The commission will have a remit to examine the handling of sexual abuse in all types of schools, primary and second level. This reflects the views of survivors. A scoping inquiry recommended that the commission’s terms of reference include the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse across all primary and post-primary schools. Will the voices of survivors be included? A “survivor engagement process” forms part of the commission. This provides a confidential space where they can share the impact of their experiences. It is not a legal process, however. Will survivors be compensated? That is the intention. Minister for Education Helen McEntee says further work is being done to examine the matter of financial redress and how any future scheme could be funded. This is viewed by many survivors as a measure of accountability for those responsible for sexual abuse in schools. Can religious orders be forced to contribute? Given the difficulties in extracting funds from religious orders in the past for abuse-related issues, many will be sceptical about whether this is possible. The Government says a further phase of detailed investigation and data analysis on this issue is essential. Ms McEntee has said “all potential levers that can be brought to bear to secure funding from those responsible for sexual abuse in schools” will be considered. This is likely to include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. The reality, however, is that survivors do not know what they will get, or when, or if they will get redress at all – and there is no clear pathway towards ensuring religious orders pay into a scheme. Will the State be liable? It could be. Some campaigners, such as Louise O’Keeffe, who won a landmark case following abuse in primary school, argue that her case established the principle that the State had an obligation to protect pupils from past ill-treatment at school and should have put safeguarding measures in place to help minimise the risk of sexual abuse. Worries over the extent of the potential redress bill and its impact on the exchequer run deep. In 2023, for example, officials in the Department of Education outlined that a broad scheme would expose the exchequer to “unquantifiable and potentially enormous costs”. Earlier this year, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure warned that the recommendations from the scoping inquiry have the potential to “very significantly impact on public finances”. As of now, however, the State cannot confidently measure its liability, nor ignore the risk of footing the bill. How will the commission work? Mr Justice Michael MacGrath – appointed to the High Court in January 2018 and a judge on the Court of Appeal since June 2024 – will chair the commission. It is due to undertake preliminary work over the coming months and will seek initial expressions of interest from people who may wish to provide information to it. As with many other statutory inquiries, what are the chances of this dragging on for years? The commission has been given a time frame to report within five years. Ms McEntee said the terms of reference are set out “very clearly” to ensure it does not go over time. “There is a very clear pause within the first two years to make sure that the commission can highlight any problems that arise,” she said. “But also it works both ways, that the minister can then identify if issues are emerging, how the work is being done, and whether or not that will result in an outcome that is appropriate.” Are there implications for schools today? The report of the initial scoping inquiry found that current child protection systems in schools are “robust and effective”, but there are recommendations for further safeguarding steps. The department said it has already begun to implement these recommendations.

Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

Title: The 15 best deals from Walmart's big Prime Day rival sale
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/deals/best-walmart-deals-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-09T18:47:58Z
Full Content:
Prime Day is ending tonight, but you can rest easy knowing there are still plenty of deals to shop in the days after Amazon's event wraps up. Walmart is running a massive competing sale until Sunday, and we've gathered the best Walmart deals rivaling those of Prime Day, below. Some of the best Walmart deals this year are on tech products, with prices matching many Amazon Prime Day discounts. Apple is particularly strong, with $120 off the new iPad Air and a 30% discount on the Apple Watch Series 10 42mm. But if you're looking to beat Amazon prices, home and kitchen is the way to go. The 21-piece beige Carote nonstick cookware set is just $100 at Walmart, while an incredibly similar cream white set is just over $123 for Prime Day. Deals are going fast, too. At $100 off, the Blackstone ProSeries 2-burner is sold out for shipping and delivery (although you can always try finding one for pickup at a nearby store). While the sale lasts through July 13, we recommend buying sooner rather than later if you see something you're interested in, since items often go out of stock. You can explore more sales in our best Prime Day deals hub and our guide to the best Prime Day competing sales. Apple is a popular category this year from Walmart, with iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, and more down to all-time lows. These prices are just as low as Amazon's during Prime Day, making now a good time to buy. The new M3 iPad Air models include an upgraded processor and added video editing features over last year's models. Otherwise, they offer the same design and features as their predecessors in the same 11-inch and 13-inch form factors. The AirPods Pro 2 are a big upgrade from their predecessors, with improved noise cancellation and battery life. They also support new aural health features to assess your hearing and function as hearing aids. This model comes with a USB-C charging case and added dust resistance. The 11th-generation iPad largely mirrors the 10th-generation iPad from 2022, apart from its upgraded A16 chip and increased storage. It lacks Apple Intelligence, but it's the cheapest option in the brand's lineup and more than enough for most users. The MacBook Air released in late 2020 with Apple's M1 processor brings impressively fast performance and long battery life for $649, making it among the best Apple laptops overall considering its price. The 44mm Apple Watch SE is simply a larger model than the 40mm SE, and is otherwise identical. The Apple Watch SE is the perfect blend of features and affordability. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with larger display sizes and cases (including a new titanium option). It runs on the latest S10 processor and has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. Apple's handy tracking device comes bundled in a discounted four-pack. Airtags are easy to set up and allow you to track multiple items in the Find My app alongside your friends and devices. The Apple Pencil (USB-C) is compatible with any iPad that has a USB-C port. These days, that's any iPad Apple sells today. It charges via USB-C, but it can still attach magnetically to your iPad. It's a little more basic than the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil, but it does support Apple's Hover feature for the iPad Pros. When it comes to tech, Walmart loves to compete with Amazon's low Prime Day pricing by matching deals for TVs, gaming, and more. These deals are as good, if not better, than what Prime members can score this week. The Linkbuds Fit are good earbuds for various workouts, but we found their design to be especially good for bike riding since they don't stick out and mess with helmet straps. The Beats Studio Pro are wireless headphones designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. This Roku Smart TV lets you stream all of your favorite apps with 4K resolution and an enhanced voice remote. The 50-inch Vizio MQX is a budget-friendly QLED built with gaming in mind. It has a higher refresh rate than most competing sets this size, which can offer smoother gameplay when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game and three months of Meta Quest+ (combined $70 value). Coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, and other home goods are popular products to find on sale during Prime Day, so Walmart is meeting the heat by dropping prices just as low as Amazon. Brands like Bissell, Dyson, Keurig, and KitchenAid are all available now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. So, the portable Bissell Little Green cleaner is a great option for small spaces like apartments, tiny houses, and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or potentially even under your sink. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This mixer packs a punch with a large stainless steel bowl meant for mixing big batches of heavier foods. It comes with 11 mixing speeds and is compatible with multiple attachments. Whether you're looking for a frying pan, a large pot, or something to stir and flip with, Carote's massive selection of nonstick cookware can help build out a kitchen. This Keurig takes the signature brewer to a new level with app compatibility so you can customize and schedule your brew. Plus, you can choose from five strength settings and six temperature settings. This corded electric Dyson is self-righting and comes with four other tools in addition to the Turbinehead to get maximum coverage on different surfaces. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum is a lightweight cleaning solution that balances battery run time and suction. The chair comes with three accent pillows and rotates on a 360-degree swivel base. This traditional kit comes with 20 treatments of whitening strips, with the goal of getting teeth 18 levels whiter within 20 days. The Sonic-Fusion combines an electric toothbrush and a Waterpik to score double the power of traditional brushing and flossing on getting rid of plaque and keeping gums healthy. This device is accepted by the American Dental Association. With the Schick Intuition Sensitive Care razor, there's no need for a separate can of shaving gel because it's built right into the razor cartridge. The AncestryDNA + Traits kit gives you all of the same information as you get from the above kit plus over 25 of your most interesting traits as determined by your genetics so you can learn about where your characteristics came from. Walmart Plus is an entire membership program designed to benefit regular shoppers at Walmart. It gets you free delivery on groceries from your local store with no minimum spend, fuel discounts, and other promo offers throughout the year. In an answer to Amazon's Prime Video bonus, you also get a free Paramount+ subscription packed with TV and movie content. While Walmart Plus subscribers got early access to Walmart's deals this week, you don't need to be a member to shop the sale now. Unlike Prime Day, the sales are for anyone and don't require any form of membership. Walmart Plus subscriptions offer more than just shopping perks. Like Amazon Prime, memberships unlock an impressive suite of benefits, including access to Paramount Plus Essential, free online pet care through Pawp, Burger King savings opportunities, and more. Most notably, memberships come with free shipping (no order minimum) and free delivery ($35 minimum) from your local store. You can learn more on the Walmart Plus membership page. The grand Walmart or Amazon debate is totally dependent on you and your needs. You can learn more about the two services and their respective perks in our Amazon Prime vs. Walmart Plus guide, where we note that while the memberships offer different value, Prime Day deals tend to be a bit better when it comes to variety and value.

By Blair Marnell on July 9, 2025 at 11:11AM PDT GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. After massive layoffs across Microsoft and its gaming studios, there hasn't been a lot of good news for the Xbox team. It's small comfort to those who lost their jobs, but Microsoft had a dominant month in May 2025 with four out of the top five best-selling games in the US. Circana has shared its report for video games sold in May, and the only game in the top five that wasn't published by Microsoft was Elden Ring Nightreign, which debuted on the list at No. 1. Doom: The Dark Ages had a strong debut at No. 2 for Microsoft and Bethesda, with Forza Horizon 5, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 rounding out the top 5. These cross-platform releases on PS5 have apparently made a sizable impact. Microsoft's perennial best-seller, Minecraft, slipped to the seventh slot in May. The only other new additions to chart in May were EA's F1 25 at No. 15, and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 at No. 19. Most of the other titles have been placing in the top 20 for months, although Star Wars Battlefront 2 made a surprising leap from No.135 to No. 12 in just a single month as fans continue to make the case for Star Wars Battlefront 3. You can find the complete roundup of the best-selling games in the US for May 2025 below. Afterwards, you can check out the updated list of the best-selling games of 2025.

Title: Bitwise CIO Reveals 4,000x Prediction, Says Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Others Will Be Impacted From One Booming Trend

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer (CIO) of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, is predicting an explosion in the tokenization of traditional assets. In a new blog post, Hougan says that the transition of stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) onto blockchains instead of traditional systems may happen much quicker than he previously thought. “I still think it will take more than a decade before the majority of stock and bond trading happens on-chain. But with major financial firms like Robinhood and Tradeweb positioning themselves for the transition today, I’ve started to wonder: could tokenization achieve 1-5% penetration in a few years? Could a dozen major pilot projects lift us to that level of market penetration? It seems possible, and it would translate into trillions of dollars … more than any other crypto application or asset, including Bitcoin. The narrative around tokenization is only going to accelerate from here – if Robinhood is rolling out tokenized trading, you can bet that Charles Schwab and others are studying it aggressively. I’d expect a wave of additional announcements this fall.” Hougan names several crypto projects that could give investors exposure to an RWA tokenization boom. “The cleanest way to invest in the rise of tokenization is to buy a basket of the top layer-1 blockchains and infrastructure plays: Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, etc.” Hougan also notes how Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, highlighted the massive growth potential for tokenization of RWAs in his 2025 annual shareholder letter, saying, “Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized.” If Larry Fink is right, Hougan says the “tokenization market could grow over 4,000x in the coming years.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Nvidia made history by becoming the world’s first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached as Nvidia’s stock price surged to $164.42 during intraday trading on July 9. The company’s stock has soared by approximately 1,460% over the past five years, with a near 18% gain registered year-to-date. Nvidia’s ascent is driven by its near-monopoly on AI chip manufacturing, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) forming the backbone of machine learning, data centers, and large language models. The Silicon Valley giant’s chips are now essential for tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Nvidia’s historic rally has had a dramatic impact on the personal fortune of its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. As of July 2025, Huang’s net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $140 billion, up $25 billion this year alone. Huang owns about 3.5% of Nvidia, making him the largest individual shareholder. This surge places Huang among the world’s 10 richest individuals, with his fortune closely tracking Nvidia’s stock performance. Nvidia now holds the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500 index, surpassing tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The milestone has fueled optimism for further growth, with some analysts projecting Nvidia’s market cap to keep rising. Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah sees Nvidia at the “front-end” of the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI pushing it past $6 trillion in coming years.

Title: Microsoft Isn't in the '$4 Trillion Club'—Yet

Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

Title: France not fit to replace BlackRock in Ukraine – party leader to RT
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621249-france-blackrock-ukraine-philippot/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T16:01:36Z
Full Content:
The reported plans by the French government to replace US investment holding BlackRock in Ukraine are “unacceptable” for the EU nation’s people, the leader of France’s Patriots party, Florian Philippot, told RT in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. BlackRock had been actively involved in developing a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund aimed at financing post-war reconstruction projects, with plans to attract $15 billion from public and private investors, including commitments from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The fund, which was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10-11, is now on hold, and France is reportedly working on an alternative plan. Last week, Bloomberg claimed, citing informed sources, that BlackRock halted the search for investors for its fund earlier this year due to US President Donald Trump’s rocky relations with the authorities in Kiev. The sources also claimed that France has been trying to set up an alternative structure that could take the spot freed by the US company in the country. However, they questioned if the reported French initiative could succeed without the American money. Philippot told RT that the report by Bloomberg came as a “complete surprise” for him. He reminded that France is €3.4 trillion (around $4 trillion) in debt and is about to face “extreme austerity,” blaming the situation on the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. ”We are no longer properly funding hospitals, farmers, security and many other expenditure items. How are we going to replace a behemoth like BlackRock in Ukraine under conditions of total military, diplomatic, financial and economic uncertainty?” the politician wondered. The general public will be against the alleged plans by the government in Paris once more people learn about them, Philippot insisted. “This is obviously unacceptable for the French,” he added. The Patriots party leader said that Macron’s moves regarding Kiev “make no sense,” urging France’s immediate and “total military and financial disengagement from Ukraine.” He also suggested that BlackRock withdrew from Ukraine because it realized that it is inevitably going to suffer a defeat at the hands of Russia. “You do not invest in a country that is going to lose,” Philippot explained. BlackRock, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: Kraken expands xStocks to BNB Chain enabling global access to tokenized equities

The expansion opens doors for global investors to trade tokenized US equities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Kraken has announced the expansion of its xStocks product to Binance-backed BNB Chain, marking a significant step toward making tokenized US equities more accessible globally. According to a July 9 statement, Kraken’s users outside the United States will soon be able to deposit and withdraw tokenized stocks, such as AAPLx, TSLAx, SPYx, and NVDAx, via BNB Chain. These assets, issued by Backed, will be deployed as BEP-20 tokens, providing seamless integration with DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap. Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO, said the expansion is part of the firm’s goal of building a “chain-neutral” and “always-on” capital market. He described tokenized equities as “programmable settlement primitives” that allow instant global transfers and atomic settlement. They also enable composability with on-chain financial products like derivatives and lending protocols. According to him: “In a world that will inevitably be multichain, it is critical that assets like equities can move fluidly across ecosystems, protocols, and liquidity layers without being gated by jurisdiction or legacy custodial rails.” Kraken’s move is part of a broader industry trend. Over the past months, several crypto-native platforms like Robinhood and Wall Street giants such as BlackRock have increasingly focused on tokenization. According to the Security Token Market, this trend is a result of a growing demand for tokenized assets, which are projected to soar to $30 trillion by 2030. Considering this, Galaxy Digital pointed out that the rapid growth of tokenization presents significant opportunities and challenges. The firm stated that the round-the-clock trading model gives users constant market access. However, it also exposes them to increased volatility during off-hours. Galaxy Digital warned that this shift could be more disruptive for traditional financial institutions. Traditional exchanges like the NYSE may face increased pressure as more brokerages move toward blockchain-based settlement and trading. Their dominance, built on centralized liquidity and structured hours, risks being eroded by platforms offering real-time trading and decentralized asset ownership. As a result, legacy exchanges must adapt or risk losing market activity. They also face the threat of losing core revenue sources, such as trading fees and data sales, to the newly emerging platforms. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

Title: Nvidia Rides the AI Wave to Become the World’s First $4 Trillion Company

When the stock markets opened this morning, Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first publicly traded company to reach a market value of $4 trillion, surpassing tech industry giants Apple and Microsoft in reaching the record-setting benchmark. While Nvidia’s market cap has since dipped to $3.99 trillion as of writing, it is nonetheless an incredible achievement to be the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark. Nvidia’s extraordinary financial success is due in significant part to the company’s commitment to making chips for the AI arms race, a move that helped it reach a $2 trillion valuation — the highest-ever at the time for a chipmaker — not even a year and a half ago. In the past five years, Nvidia’s stock price has gone from less than $11 per share to over $163 today. Save for a sizable tumble in April this year, which the company has obviously since recovered from, it has been nearly exclusively good news for the American multinational corporation during the AI era. Nvidia’s revenue eclipsed $130.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 114% increase year-over-year, and way above the company’s $26.97 billion revenue in 2023. Nvidia’s rise has been meteoric. Meanwhile, Microsoft, which boasts an impressive $3.75 trillion market cap, has experienced tremendous growth of its own over the past five years. Microsoft’s stock price has risen 290 points, or 136%, in five years. In contrast to many of its peers, Microsoft has also had an excellent 2025 so far, with stock prices rising 20.5% since January 1. However, Microsoft recently laid off about 15,000 employees as part of its AI-focused restructuring in the past two months, so while investors may be loving Microsoft, all is not well at the Redmond-based company. Another company that was a strong contender to hit the $4 trillion market cap mark first, Apple, has experienced a very different 2025 than Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple’s stock price has dropped 35 points (14.3%) so far this year and is about 50 points off its peak from last December. On December 27, 2024, Apple came close to $4 trillion — hitting $3.86 trillion. From hitting $1 trillion market cap in May 2023 to topping $4 trillion, if only briefly, on July 9, 2025, Nvidia has benefited from the AI hype more than any other company on Earth. “This is a historical moment for Nvidia, the tech space flexing its muscles, and speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of growth led by the one chip fueling AI… Nvidia,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN over email today. Ives also told CNN that he expects Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion mark sometime this summer. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the company is still in the early stages of AI’s financial and technological potential. He said on an earnings call in May that every country and industry on Earth will need AI. Huang may be right, as the financial markets love AI, even if society at large doesn’t.

And the most valuable company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia on Wednesday became the world's first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company ever. The company's stock price is driven by the AI frenzy as well as its unique position in the AI ecosystem as the key supplier of hardware and software stack for training and inference. By reaching the $4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia not only left behind such tech giants as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft, but also the vast majority of semiconductor companies. Only Broadcom ($1.298 trillion) and TSMC ($1.2 trillion) are in the Top 10 of the world's most valuable companies and are among the three semiconductor firms to reach a trillion-dollar capitalization mark. Other semiconductor companies, such as ASML ($313.22 billion), AMD ($226.76 billion), Texas Instruments ($197.61 billion), Arm Holdings ($161.3 billion), and Qualcomm ($175.67 billion) are far from touching a $1 trillion market capitalization. Intel, once an investors' darling, is now valued at $101.26 billion. Such a huge difference between the market capitalization of Nvidia and its industry peers underscores the unique position that Nvidia holds in today's high-tech ecosystem. The company supplies AI GPUs to virtually all of the AI leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, just to name a few. So far, only Microsoft Azure has warned that it would slow down the expansion of its data centers. Other companies are well on track to expand their AI clusters to hundreds of thousands or even millions of Nvidia GPUs in the coming years, so the sky is blue for Nvidia. Observers believe that investors' optimism about Nvidia stems from three factors. Firstly, they expect the AI sector to continue growing in the coming years, which will ensure growing sales of AI hardware. Secondly, Nvidia is expected to sustain its leading position on the market as so far, no company has unveiled hardware that can match the performance and scalability of Nvidia's GPUs for AI training and inference. Thirdly, investors now expect the U.S. to reach trade deals with the most important partners, which will ensure the company's ability to supply its products to growing markets, including the Middle East and Europe, which will offset the company's current inability to supply high-performance AI GPUs to China.

Title: Ambani's Reliance Jio delays India IPO beyond this year: Report
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambanis-reliance-jio-delays-india-ipo-beyond-this-year-report-11752071301806.html

NEW DELHI/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Indian telecoms and digital giant Reliance Jio Platforms, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has decided not to launch its planned IPO this year, delaying one of the country's most anticipated stock offerings, two people familiar with the matter said. Valued by analysts at more than $100 billion, Jio wants to achieve higher revenue and a bigger subscriber base for its telecoms business while expanding its other digital offerings to boost its valuation before an initial public offering, one of the sources said. Shares of parent conglomerate Reliance Industries fell sharply in Mumbai after the Reuters report, losing as much as 1.8%, or $6 billion in market value. Reliance closed 1.2% down, with its significant weighting in other indexes dragging the broader Indian market into negative territory. Nearly 80% of Jio Platforms' latest annual revenue of $17.6 billion came from its telecoms business -- Reliance Jio Infocomm, India's biggest player. But Ambani is also accelerating expansion of his other niche digital businesses focused on developing apps, connected devices and AI business solutions. Reliance Jio is also set to lock horns with Elon Musk, who is expected to launch the Starlink internet service in India in the coming months. Jio, which counts Google and Meta among investors, has also partnered Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure. Ambani said in 2019 that Jio and Reliance Retail will move towards listings within five years. And last year Reuters reported that Reliance was targeting a 2025 Mumbai listing for Jio Platforms, aiming for it to be India's biggest IPO. "Jio (IPO) is not going to happen this year, it's just not possible. The company wants the business to be more mature," the first source said. Both the sources, who declined to be identified because the strategy is confidential, said Reliance had yet to appoint bankers to discuss a potential stock market offering. Reliance did not respond to Reuters queries on the matter. Jio Infocomm has faced some churn in its subscriber base after price increases but has returned to growth this year and has more than 488 million subscribers. Indian brokerage IIFL Capital said in April that it was cutting its 2025-26 core profit estimate for Jio by 3%, citing higher costs and the expected increase in prices, probably in late 2025. It also cut its valuation estimate from $117 billion to $111 billion, though Jefferies values the business at $136 billion. The first source declined to share the valuation that Jio had been targeting for the proposed IPO but said it was "easily above $100 billion". India's IPO market had its best year in 2024, with $20.5 billion raised, second only to the United States. Trade wars and Middle East tension have turned market sentiment jittery, but it is recovering. India is the world's second-biggest IPO market with $5.86 billion raised by June this year, accounting for the 12% of total proceeds globally, LSEG data shows. Reuters has previously reported that the Reliance Retail IPO was being delayed for the company to address operational challenges at the company that runs India's biggest grocery store network of 3,000 supermarkets. The Reliance Retail IPO is unlikely before 2027 or 2028, the first source added without elaborating. Reliance Retail and Jio have powered the parent's earnings in the six months to March while its energy segment has been hit by lower margins and weaker demand. Ambani, Asia's richest man, has raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecoms and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, General Atlantic and Silver Lake in recent years. "The investors are not upset (about IPO delays). They know the money is sitting in front of them," the first source said.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI Chips Are “The New Gold And Oil,” Says Investment Bank As Firm Briefly Crosses $4 Trillion Market Value

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU designer NVIDIA Corporation made history today by becoming the first company in history to cross a $4 trillion market capitalization before slightly dipping below it. NVIDIA's achievement follows a surge in its shares in June after a massive crash in January that saw the firm bleed $600 billion in market capitalization after investors fed the shares, worrying that China's DeepSeek had demonstrated cost-effective GPU use that could cull the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. June was a strong month for NVIDIA's shares as they benefited from bullish analyst estimates for medium-term AI demand. NVIDIA continues to enjoy a dominant role in the AI ecosystem courtesy of its GPUs, which lead the market in terms of performance and are among the most highly sought products in the world. The criticality of NVIIDA's GPUs was evident in a fresh note from Wedbush, which came just as the firm crossed the $4 trillion market capitalization milestone. Calling NVIDIA's AI chips "the new gold and oil," the investment bank posits that $4 trillion is just the start and investor attention will focus on $5 trillion over the next 18 months. Wedbush adds that NVIDIA might not be the only $4 trillion company, as it might be joined by software giant Microsoft. NVIDIA's shares have stayed resilient despite US sanctions on China, which have hurt the firm's revenue. The robust performance is partly due to CEO Jensen Huang pivoting to sovereign AI after the Chinese restrictions to assure investors that NVIDIA can sell its chips to other countries as well. Like NVIDIA, Microsoft's shares were also laggards at the year's start. The stock had struggled since mid-2024 after investors were left wondering whether the software company could adequately monetize its AI cloud computing offerings. However, Microsoft's latest earnings report shifted the narrative, as 33% Azure growth during its fiscal third quarter ended up allaying investor concerns. "We believe Microsoft will also hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club," said Wedbush as it believes that the AI-led stock market growth is still in its nascent stages. Going all-in on AI, the investment bank shares that "it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years" and adds "that for every $1 spent on Nvidia, there is an $8-$10 multiplier across the rest of the tech ecosystem." While Wedbush's note focuses primarily on enterprise AI, the bank briefly mentions that Alphabet, Amazon and Meta are its favorite players in consumer AI. Notably missing is Apple, whose 13% year-to-date share price drop is partly due to investor belief that the firm has fallen behind big tech when it comes to AI. The bank concludes its note by sharing that it is seeing "many IT departments focused on foundational hyper scale deployments for AI around Microsoft, Amazon, and Google with a laser focused on the software driven use cases currently underway as high priority AI use cases have been identified and now being driven/accelerated across a myriad of verticals."

Archaeological excavations of an Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE) domestic neighborhood at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, Israel, uncovered four complete skeletons of young female donkeys that were buried immediately below house floors as ritual foundation deposits. Multi-isotope analyses (carbon, oxygen and strontium) of their teeth document that each of the donkeys was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where they were slaughtered and buried beneath house floors in a non-elite domestic neighborhood. In contrast, isotopic analysis of teeth from a single isolated donkey mandible and additional sheep and goat teeth that displayed evidence of being used for food consumption and not associated with a complete burial, identify the donkey as born and raised among local livestock in the vicinity of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The intentionally buried of specifically imported and highly valued young jennies reveal what appears to be a ritually charged characteristic when constructing domestic residences at the site.

Archaeological excavations in an Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE) domestic neighborhood at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath uncovered four complete young female donkey skeletons (EQ1-EQ4) buried immediately below house floors. The first excavated donkey (EQ1 – also known as a sacrificial ass) is a clear sacrificial foundation deposit [1]. Isotopic analyses indicated that it was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to the site where it was slaughtered [2]. The isotopic study has been completed on the three additional complete donkey burials excavated at the site in 2016 (EQ2 and EQ3) and 2017 (EQ4). For comparative purposes, isotopic analyses were also conducted on a loose equid mandible that was recovered in 2017 (EQ21), as well as on livestock (sheep and goat) specimens from the same deposits at the site. In addition, bioavailable strontium from the surroundings of the site were also analyzed. The results presented here confirm exchange connections between Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath and Old Kingdom Egypt as proposed by the isotopic data from EQ1. They further reveal a decision to sacrifice young and healthy female animals, those exclusively imported from Egypt. The archaeological site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (modern Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi; ancient Gath) is in central Israel about 20 km from the Mediterranean coast on the southern bank of the Elah Valley. It is located on top of a natural limestone outcrop at the westernmost edge of the Judean Foothills (Shephelah in Hebrew) and overlooks the modern southern Coastal Plain of Israel [3] (Fig 1). This location allowed access to fresh water and exploitation of a rich variety and abundance of natural food resources from both the rolling foothills and coastal plain [4–7]. The site is positioned along or near several major transportation routes that transect the locality to regions to the north, south, east and west. These include the north-south “Trough Valley” along the base of the Judean Mountains to the east of the site; the north-south road along the coastal plain to the west of the site; and the east-west route that extends from the coast to the Judean highlands through the Elah Valley) [8,9]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g001 During the Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE), the site reaches urban proportions typical for this region (c. 24 ha in size) (Fig 2) and becomes one of the largest and most important of Early Bronze urban centers in the southern Levant [10–15]. It is surrounded by a thick and tall stone-based fortification system [16–24]. As a result of systematic surface collection and excavation, there is now evidence for an extensive Early Bronze (EB) occupation across the entire tell (or mound) [12,15]. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g002 Excavations conducted over the course of several seasons (2004–2017) at the eastern end of the site (Area E), uncovered part of an EB III urban residential (domestic) neighborhood [12,14]. The urban character of the site on whole during the EB III is seen through the extensive fortifications, evidence of social hierarchy and bureaucracy [25], and finds indicating economic connectivity [6,26–28] with broad regions in the Levant and beyond. In the excavation of Area E of the site, parts of several non-elite domestic residential buildings and an alleyway were intensively excavated and the remains studied (Fig 3). Three major strata of urban renewal occurred toward the end of the EB III period. In the earliest Stratum E5c (dated to the later EB III, c. 2700−2600 BCE), the buildings established in earlier strata (Strata E6-E7) are demolished and built anew. In the two subsequent strata (E5b and E5a), the buildings undergo further renovations where rooms are subdivided. After Stratum E5a, the site is abandoned/destroyed and there is no occupation in this area for more than a thousand years [29–31]. In the earliest E5c stratum, just before the walls were built, at least four donkeys were sacrificed and buried beneath the beaten earth floors of each building room. A thick (10−20 cm) layer of grey ashy soil accumulated above the floors during the occupation before the next strata of renewal occurred (E5b and a) [1,32–34]. Two radiocarbon contexts from Stratum E5c were measured from Building 134307, in which EQ1 was buried. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BCE for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g003 Four of the donkey specimens (EQ1–4) are from Stratum E5c and are completely articulated skeletons found buried beneath the earthen floor of the courtyards, at the layers of the floor infrastructure, in two large buildings on either side of the alleyway (Fig 3 and Fig 4a, b, c, d; Supplementary S1 Table). Each of the donkeys is buried in shallow pits about 20–30 cm beneath the floors in the time just before the floors were laid down as the neighborhood is being renewed. There is no evidence that they are later intrusions since they are sealed by the Stratum E5c dirt floor. All the burial pits were found without any other finds, only the equid skeletons. This contrasts with the rest of the infrastructure layers, where non-indicative pottery was found. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g004 One skeleton lies below the floor of Building 134307 (EQ1), while three lie below the floor of Building 17E82D08 across the alley (EQ2–4). In EQ1, the front and hind legs were tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium were dismembered. It is evident that the animal was sacrificed as the head is fully cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. The head rests on its left side. The three other complete skeletons are found across the alleyway buried beneath Courtyard 17E82D08 of Building 17E82D08. They also lie on their left sides, but without any clear evidence of dismemberment. Their legs also appear to have been trussed, as the feet are brought close together or overlap beneath their abdomens. While there are no artefacts associated with these interments, the deposits are ritual interments [1,9], with each of the skeletons carefully laid out in the same manner. Each is placed in a separate pit with the head facing east (possibly toward the rising sun) [33]. Further, all are either old subadults or young adults and healthy females who were killed in the prime of their lives. Fragments of donkey figurine and zoomorphic vessel carrying loads were also found in Stratum E5a. That the skulls of all four donkeys face eastwards, as well as their similar age and sex, suggests a cultic/ritual choice. Such an eastern orientation of skeletal remains is similar to preferences seen in Anatolia [35] and elsewhere in the southern Levant [36]. In contrast, EQ21 (Stratum E7) is the only incomplete skeleton discussed here (L20E93A12; B20E93A139). It is represented by an isolated mandible with teeth (LPM2–4 and M1-3, but M3 is only visible in the crypt). It was found in the collapse of a Stratum E7 building amidst a concentration of stones (L20E93A11) likely representing a floor in Stratum E7. It was selected for comparison with the four donkey burials as it was an example of an equid consumed, and its remains discarded afterwards. In addition, isotopic analysis for several sheep and goat specimens from the same horizons and bioavailable strontium specimens from surroundings of the site were also included to form a regional isoscape and baseline for comparison with the donkey remains. Each of these are discussed below to interpret the four donkeys ritually buried beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed. Isotope signatures are incorporated into animal tissues and are stored for variable periods of time, depending on the turnover rate of the different tissues. As tooth enamel does not turnover once formed, [37] isotopic analysis provides a picture of the animal’s diet, seasonality and/or mobility at the time of formation. Hoppe et al. [38] utilized radiographic and optical analyses to determine the timing of tooth enamel biomineralization in horses. Their results indicate that the Molar 1 (M1) begins to mineralize around two weeks of age and continues to mineralize for approximately one year after eruption (occurring between 8 months and one year). As such, the first molar records isotopic signatures of diet and mobility up to approximately two years of age. The second molar (LM2) begins to mineralize before eruption at approximately six months of age, the tooth erupts between 20–26 months and will continue to mineralize for an additional 30 months. Mineralization of molar 3 (M3) starts when M1 and M2 erupt (~6–8 months), while M3 erupts between 3.5 and 4 years. The intra-tooth sampling of teeth utilized here will reveal information on shifts in diet (carbon), water (oxygen) and mobility (strontium) from birth to approximately five years of age. As each equid is aged through tooth eruption and wear and epiphyseal fusion at approximately five years of age1 this sampling strategy documents their entire lifespan. The use of stable carbon isotopes to reconstruct diet is well-established in archaeology. Terrestrial plants in the southern Levant can be divided into two groups (C3, C4) based on their differential means of fixing atmospheric CO2. These differential mechanisms result in distinct δ13C values. These differences in the δ13C values of the plants consumed are reflected in the tissues of the animals that consume them [39–41]. While C3 vegetation is dominant in Mediterranean climate zones [42], C4 grasses are also part of the flora of Mediterranean regions [43] and their abundance increases in steppe and desert environments [44]. Oxygen isotope composition in the tooth enamel in mammals is linked to the isotopic composition of environmental water they consume [45,46]. As the isotopic composition of the water is correlated with temperature and evapotranspiration, it will vary seasonally. In mid- to high- latitudes the lowest δ18O values are seen in the coldest months and the highest δ18O values during the summer months [47]. Strontium isotopes are useful as biogeochemical tracers in the study of mobility as they are characteristic of the local geology [48]. Strontium 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary locally with changes in local bedrock geology, bedrock weathering, and the contribution of atmospheric dust [49]. Soil and plants are in isotopic equilibrium with local soils and share similar isotopic ratios for bioavailable strontium. Animals consuming these plants incorporate strontium in the mineral structure of bones and teeth as calcium substitutes during tissue formation. Measurement of the strontium ratio will provide a measure of the relative importance of foods from areas of variable lithologies [50]. As a result, migration studies should utilize biologically available strontium rather than only substrate geology. Plants, soil, rodents and/or invertebrates may be collected for this purpose. Isotope results are presented in Fig 5 and 6 and in Supplementary S2 and S3 Tables. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g006 EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 molars; 82 samples) have mean carbon isotope values of −2.7‰ and ranges from −7.5‰ to 0.7‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5) while EQ21 (n = 3 molars; 37 samples) has a = −10.5‰ and a range between −11.2‰ to −9.8‰ (Fig 6). These values suggest that EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 were eating vegetation from a mixed C3/C4 environment with a high proportion of C4 vegetation as was seen with EQ1 [2]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples, which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet, matching the diet of previously sampled caprines (abbreviated OC for Ovis/Capra including both sheep and goat) [51]. EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth, 81 samples) have average strontium ratios of 0.70824, and ranges of 0.70813 to 0.70833 (S3 Table, Fig 5). There are obvious similarities to the strontium ratios of the first and second molars of EQ1. EQ21 (n = 3 teeth; 40 samples) has an average of 0.70839, and ranges between 0.70836 to 0.70844 (Fig 6). The mean δ18O values for EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth; 82 samples) = 0.96‰ and values range between −1.6 -to 2.6‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5). Modern oxygen isotope values for the Nile River before the construction of Aswan Dam provide an average δ18O (VSMOW) of 0.74‰ and measured in shallow groundwater reservoirs [52]. These values align with the mean oxygen isotope values for Egyptian archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (1.05 ± 1.02‰) [53]. The seasonal fluctuation in the δ18O values of sacrificial donkeys EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4, record short negative spikes (~−1‰ relative to adjacent samples and marked by green shaded areas in Fig 5). These correspond to summer season incorporation of Blue Nile water from the Ethiopian highland with measured [55]. Calculating the mean δ18O values of all the molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 excluding the negative pulses highlights the significance of these shifts. The average of EQ2 molars minus the two negative samples at 6.4 mm and 34 mm (n = 30) is 0.8 ± 0.56‰ (1 std. dev.) vs. 0.95‰, the mean of the two negative pulses, a difference more than two standard deviations lower than the average. This pattern is repeated in EQ3 (n = 22; 1.2 + 0.8‰ vs. −0.5‰) and EQ4 (n = 22; 0.7 + 0.4‰ vs. −0.4‰). The oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ than those of the donkeys (2 tail t-test assuming equal variance p > 0.00001) and range between −0.1 to −3.5‰ (Fig 6). EQ21 values agree with oxygen isotope values measured in caprines from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51] and correspond to mean modern δ18O values of rainfall of the southern Levant in proximity to the site between −3.5– (−5)‰ (VSMOW) [54]. The statistical procedure PROC DISTANCE in SAS was used to assess all of the isotope data (carbon, oxygen and strontium) currently available from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (EQ1 [2]; all caprines [51]) and the three additional equids (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4 and EQ21) discussed here. The DISTANCE procedure computes measures of dissimilarity or similarity between the observations. The output data set was then used as input to the MDS procedures. The MDS PROC performed multidimensional scaling to create Dimensions 1–4 (see Supplementary S4 Table). Dimensions 3 and 4 are all near zero and are redundant. As such, only Dimensions 1 and 2 are graphed (Fig 7). The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g007 Previous isotopic analyses of EQ1 utilized carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic proxies as evidence that this individual was born and lived in the Nile Valley prior to travel and eventual sacrifice at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2]. EQ1 completed its early tooth development in the Nile Valley and later migrated to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where it completed the formation of its third molar. The three samples closest to the root/enamel junction (REJ) are the last to mineralize and reflect the shift in diet, water source and local geology (highlighted with arrows in Fig 7). This corroborates textual and other archaeological information that already pointed toward the existence of long-distance trade of donkey caravans between Egypt and Canaan during this early urban period. The analyses of four additional equids (from 3 burials and a single loose mandible) presented here provides additional direct evidence for the import of equids from Egypt to the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. While all four burials point to an Egyptian origin, the single loose mandible isotopic signature suggests a local origin from around the site. This is mirrored by the results of the other domestic livestock and bioavailable strontium analyses. While a single caprine was also identified as having an Egyptian origin, all the other caprines sampled (n = 16) reflect discrete values that indicate their life history was focused locally at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2,51]. The primary indicator for Nile Valley origins of EQ1–4 is the dominance of C4 vegetation (>50%) in their diet, as indicated by the δ13C carbonate values measured in the early tooth formation of the EQ1 (M1 + M2) and in all three molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (Fig 5). As has been previously asserted [1] the Nile Valley is the nearest geographic location where C4 vegetation can serve as primary fodder for herbivores [55,56]. Seasonal shifts in carbon isotope values can be associated with agricultural cycles in the Nile Valley. C4 plants are not the sole forage or fodder source in Egypt but serve as a good food source for livestock. It is evident that on a seasonal basis donkeys might eat more C3 plants (by-products of agricultural production). The expected pattern of change in carbon isotopes for an animal moving from the Nile River Valley to the interior of the southern Levant would be a shift from a C4 plant dominant diet to a predominant C3 diet (Fig 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g008 This pattern is reflected in all equids showing a greater C3 contribution to the diet in their third molars. In contrast, the δ13C values of the sampled caprines predominantly reflect the C3 vegetation that dominates the Mediterranean climate with only a minor contribution of C4 vegetation [51]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet (Fig 6). EQ1 δ18O values match archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values that were analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (+1.05 ± 1.02‰)54 and the same is true for EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. In addition, the oxygen isotopes of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 provide an important secondary marker for Egyptian origin with the observation of the Blue Nile negative oxygen isotope pulses along the teeth. Sequential sampling along first and second molars display a negative dip (~1‰) of oxygen isotope values at around 33−43 mm from the root-enamel-junction (REJ) that is congruent with seasonal flow of tributary water into the Nile River. These low points are associated with late summer flooding caused by the Blue Nile input. The flow of monsoon water from the highlands of Ethiopia into the Blue Nile occurs during late summer months and provides a pulse of 18O depleted water that dominate premodern Nile volume (85% of Nile flow) and composition [57,58]. The summer main rainy season mean oxygen isotope composition of the Blue Nile from the highlands of Ethiopia is −2.3‰ [57]. The intensity of Blue Nile water flow varies between years in agreement with ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) [59]. It is therefore unsurprising to see variability in the expression of Blue Nile signal within and between individuals. Further, a second negative dip in the oxygen isotope values is suggested by trends in the final samples of the teeth indicating a complete seasonal cycle. In contrast, the oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ and match the δ18O values in caprine (OC) teeth studied at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. Values vary between 0 – (−2) ‰ (n = 13, and are comparable to prehistoric gazelles originating in low topographies of the eastern Galilee and much higher than the negative values measured in high topography gazelles [60]. This pattern suggests that the EB caprine herds, and EQ21 were herded eastwards from the site to the lower reaches of the Judean Mountains. Even though the Judean Mountains elevation reaches ~1000 m above modern sea level, there is no indication that they were herded into the higher reaches of the Judean Mountains since their isotopic values are comparable to the gazelle’s low topographies values. Arnold et al. [2] detail plant collection strategy and results that allowed creation of a local isoscape surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. There is an 87Sr/86 Sr range of 0.7084–0.7085 for the rendzina soils that cover the area east of the site. This hilly region is very suitable for the herding of both grazers (sheep) and browsers (goats), while the flatter dark brown alluvium vertisol soils located west of the site that extend to the seashore are more suitable for rainfed cereal agriculture [61]. Plant sampling also took place on Holocene alluvium soils (vertisols) to the west of the site. However, this sampling cannot provide a credible estimate for all alluvial soils as alluvium strontium ratios vary depending on parent bedrock weathering and atmospheric deposition. Terra rossa (FAO: Cambisols and Phaeozems) soils develop on hard marine sedimentary bedrock (limestone and dolomite) primarily through atmospheric deposition [49,61]. This is evident from examination of plants growing on these soils since they incorporate bioavailable strontium with 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7086 ± 0.0003. Moffat et al. [62] report two soil data points in the vicinity of the site that agree with 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.70828–0.70870. In contrast, isoscapes are not as well developed in Egypt. A literature review of isotopic studies for the Nile Valley presents a median based on both animal and human data of 0.7076 ± 0.0003. However, the analyzed faunal samples show sizeable ranges and much wider ranges than the majority of the human samples. While the data from Tell el-Dab‘a (Hutwaret/Avaris) in the northeastern Nile Delta fits this range [63], it is problematically drawn from six archaeological bone samples. Strontium analysis from bone is problematic due to the greater impact of diagenesis on bone [64] as there is no accepted pretreatment that can fully deal with the issue of diagenesis in bone [65]. In addition, one of the Egyptian “baseline” animals is an equid, which is potentially a very mobile animal in the landscape as is argued here. Human burials from the Nile Valley yield tighter ratio ranges. For example, Memphis in Lower Egypt, =0.7078 ± 0.003; range 0.7074–0.7087 [66]. Although not exclusive to the Nile Valley, the strontium ratios do not contradict the other two independent lines of isotopic evidence – carbon and oxygen, that argue for Egyptian origins of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. The statistical analyses display two clusters. The first and second molars of EQ1 (while that individual lived in Egypt), EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 all cluster on the right side of the graph (Fig 7). As does OC (Caprine) #3 – previously identified as having an Egyptian origin [2,51]. EQ21 and most caprines (apart from OC#3) all cluster on the left side of the graph. Also, on the left side of the graph, are the two samples closest to the REJ of EQ1’s M3 as these are the final samples to mineralize and thereby incorporate the isotopic signatures surrounding the site. From the pooled data of carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope values, we define a foreign cluster (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4, EQ1 first and second molars and OC#3) versus a local cluster at the site that includes EQ21, all other OC, the two final samples of EQ1’s third molar, one final sample of EQ2 and the two final samples of EQ4. All equids imported from Egypt are buried, fully articulated in household contexts and under habitation floors. Only equids receive this treatment and only equids from Egypt. One goat indicates Egyptian origins but was not intentionally buried [51]. Rather it was butchered, eaten and its remains discarded in a midden. One donkey (EQ21) does not have isotopic values that indicate its origin in Egypt, and it was also not intentionally buried. It was butchered and its remains were discarded. From our analysis, the donkeys imported from Egypt had greater social value than those raised and utilized locally. Cross-culturally, the selection of sacrificial animals is known to be based on criteria such as age, sex, species [67] and even coat color when preservation allows [68,69], but never seemingly selected based on geographic origin. From the perspective of the isotope studies, it is the Egyptian import status that is one of the key criteria for an animal to be selected for sacrifice. Being young and female are the other two variables. Thus, young female donkeys from Egypt are the ideal sacrificial animal at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath during the EB III. Perhaps, as noted elsewhere, they represented a distinct totem animal linked with the identity of inhabitants as merchants/traders [9]. These stand in contrast to a local equid (EQ21 – unable to determine sex) that was butchered and likely eaten. EQ21 derives from an earlier deposit at the site (Stratum E7) which slightly pre-dates the four completely articulated equid burials (probably less than 50 years). It is suggested that even within this preferred group, EQ1 is noteworthy. EQ1 was buried with the front and hind legs tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium dismembered and placed on the abdomen facing east. It is evident the animal was sacrificed, the head entirely cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. In contrast, the other equids were buried without trussed limbs and without decapitation. In addition, it appears that EQ1 alone was prepared for sacrifice as the isotopic data indicates her residence at the site for several months prior to sacrifice as is evident from the three final data points (on M3 closest to REJ) as has been previously argued [2]. These final strontium ratios are also more radiogenic than the other equids and local livestock. These ratios reflect agricultural areas on terra rosa soils like those found to the west of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. It can be deduced that even though EQ1 was grazed locally toward the end of her life, she was treated slightly differently from the other local equids. This imported donkey was kept penned and foddered with hay that was harvested in the valley, a product of dry farmed cereals. This donkey was never herded with other livestock east of the site. The archaeological, iconographic and textual evidence from the broader region surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath highlights the centrality of equids in the culture and societies of the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Equids are known as work animals within the agricultural systems, used for plowing, threshing and as draft animals. In addition, equids played a significant role in trade, not only moving goods on their backs but also as valuable trade items themselves [33,70–72]. It is clear that some equids were elevated to the status of prestige animals as evidenced by their intentional sacrifice and burial at sites across the Levant, Syria and Mesopotamia. Notably, these burials occur in a variety of different contexts, both domestic [33] and elite [70,73,74], singularly and in pairs [75], both males and females and varying in age from nine months [75] to nine years [76]. This suggests regional preferences for specific types of equids for sacrifice, such as those from Egypt, as is proposed here. Further, the textual data also discusses selective breeding of equids and desired qualities of animals for particular purposes [73,75]. Our analysis has demonstrated that the non-local donkeys (young females in particular) were preferentially selected for sacrifice and burial beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed in the Early Bronze III urban center at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The isotopic analysis suggests that imported Egyptian asses were preferentially selected as sacrificial animals, while locally raised equids were butchered and likely eaten. The data further highlights the charged ritual significance and value of select donkeys in this period of early complex state-level urban societies in the region. It was not any donkey that was deemed worthy of sacrifice at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, but only Egyptian young females. This suggests the function of these sacrifices is not simply a totem animal or an occupation marker but was socially and ritually charged by having come from Egypt. The importance and charged significance of the display of economic, and likely social and political connections with Egypt, was an integral part of the sacrificial ritual. Thus, an Egyptian donkey might have been seen as an exotic and special animal, worthy of specific ritual use. All necessary permits were obtained for the study described, which complied with all relevant regulations. Excavation permits were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit #, G-56/2008, G-51/2010, G-66/2016, G-62/2017). Permits for export of material from Israel were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit # 13840 – July 25, 2012).

The samples were taken from an installation (E15AM09) (Fig 9). Sample RTD 6830 (Basket # TS12E15AM100) was taken within broken sherds of a holemouth cooking pot found inside a cooking installation built of stones. Seeds were measured in three separate targets to reach a higher precision for the context. For sample RTD 6844 (Basket # TS12E15AM083), seeds were taken from a thin white layer of phytoliths covering the cooking installation. Four separate targets were measured for a high precision date. For the sampling, pretreatment and measurement protocols [77–81] of the Dangoor Research Accelerator Spectroemter at the Weizmann Institute. The radiocarbon dates were calibrated using Oxcal v4.4.4 Bronk Ramsey (2021) software based on the calibration curve Reimer et al 2020 [81]. The measurements of each context were combined using the Rcombine function in the Oxcal v4.4.4 program, and both contexts passed the χ2 test. We built a small model using Oxcal v4.4.4 software [80,81] together with the samples from Stratum E5a [14], including a sequential boundary between the layers, since no samples from Stratum E5b were measured from this room. The agreement of the model is 61%. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BC for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions (Fig 10 and Table 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g009 The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g010 As each analyzed equid individual had an intact mandible, it was possible to sample all three molar teeth from each individual (Table 3). The total number of teeth per sample was determined by the size of the tooth. The third molar from EQ4 was sampled less due to breakage. Sequential sampling of teeth followed methods outlined by Bocherens et al. [82]. A series of 1.0 mm bands were drilled sequentially along the mesial lobe of each molar tooth. Dentin and cementum were removed from the equine teeth [83] prior to enamel sampling. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t003 Pretreatment of the samples followed the methods of Balasse and colleagues [84–86]. The tooth enamel was treated with a 2.5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) solution overnight to remove organics and then rinsed five times with distilled water and treated with 0.1M CH3COOH (acetic acid, pH3) for four hours to remove diagenetic carbonates. The samples were then rinsed five times with distilled water and freeze-dried. Even-numbered samples were analyzed for strontium isotope ratios and odd-numbered samples were analyzed for carbon and oxygen isotope compositions. Strontium isotope measurements were performed on a Nu Plasma HR multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Geology Department. Tooth enamel samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 3N nitric acid (HNO3) under clean lab conditions. Cation exchange columns loaded with Eichrom® Sr spec resin and pre-conditioned with 3N HNO3 were prepared and the 0.5 ml samples were then loaded. Column blanks consisted of 0.5 ml of 3N HNO3. Columns were washed four times with 0.3 ml of 3N HNO3 and then strontium was eluted into 4 ml Teflon® vials with 1 ml of 0.05N HNO3 and 3 ml of ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore) following Horwitz et al. [87]. Sample concentrations are measured and corrected to optimal range. Linear normalization of sample results was applied based on within-run trends in SRM 987 relative to its accepted value (0.710255). Analytical precision on repeated standard measurements was ± 0.00003. Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses were performed in the Department of Anthropology’s Stable Isotope Laboratory and the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Approximately 700 μg of the prepared sample was weighed into individual vessels and reacted with 100% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) at 70°C in an automated Kiel III carbonate device in which CO2 is liberated from enamel, cryogenically distilled, and subsequently flowed to a Finnigan MAT 252 isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. Two laboratory standards (NBS18 and NBS 19) were interspersed, and replicates were run to ensure accuracy. Analytical precision is typically ±0.07‰ for δ13C and ±0.14‰ for δ18O. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s005 (DOCX) We are grateful for the assistance of Stanley H.

Title: BlackRock Suddenly Snubs US Government Bonds, Shifting to This Geography Amid Sticky Inflation Concerns: Report

The world’s largest asset manager has reportedly turned on US Treasuries. In a report seen by Bloomberg, BlackRock Investment Institute strategists recently upgraded their view on European government bonds from slightly underweight to neutral, comparing them positively to US government debt obligations. BlackRock also notes that the Federal Reserve may hold back on cutting interest rates due to sticky inflation, while high budget deficits might urge investors to ask for a higher yield premium to hold long-dated US bonds. “We prefer euro area government bonds and credit over the US. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our expectations relative to US Treasuries.” The BlackRock strategists specifically highlight bonds from Italy and Spain. The asset manager isn’t the only financial giant to take a less optimistic view of US Treasuries. Goldman Sachs market strategists also recently lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Goldman’s economists originally predicted the Fed would only enact one rate cut near the end of the year, but they are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. The Financial Times recently reported that $11 billion in US long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt were sold in only three months. The second quarter sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off occurring in 2022 Q2.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.

Title: Challenge of predicting Texas floods and SCOTUS allows for mass federal layoffs: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Meteorologists and forecasting experts say the severity of the deadly Texas floods couldn’t have been predicted. The Supreme Court allows Donald Trump to move forward with mass firings. And more pet owners are opting into insurance for their furry family members. Here’s what to know today. At least 161 people are missing after catastrophic floods tore through the Texas Hill Country, Gov. Greg Abbott said yesterday, as the desperate search for survivors continues. The death toll rose to at least 110 people. Meanwhile, scrutiny and questions are mounting about how and when people in the area received flash flood alerts. Among those questions: What actions were taken to notify residents? Were emergency alerts adequate, and who issued them? It was also unclear whether alerts were received on all phones. At a news conference yesterday, local officials and law enforcement in Kerr County couldn’t provide basic details of the emergency response. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. While National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding ahead of time, the best weather models could not have predicted precisely where the most intense rainfall would land, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin, meteorologists and forecasting experts said. Texas state climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon called such a prediction “next to impossible.” What did happen was that “all the ingredients came together at the wrong place, at the wrong time, at night on a holiday weekend,” said David Gagne, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. Though NOAA is working to build better weather models, that research is on the chopping block. As science reporter Evan Bush explains, a succession of thunderstorms fed by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry hit the region. Weather charts showed that the south fork of the Guadalupe River took a direct and prolonged hit. Then, instead of moving on, the storms stalled and dumped 10-12 inches of rain over six hours. Making matters worse, the area — consisting of steep hills and narrow canyons that rapidly funnel water from smaller creeks into swollen rivers — was filled with campers near the river’s edge. If the storm had been even five miles in another direction, it would not have produced as much destruction, Nilsen-Gammon said. Read the full story here. The Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump, at least temporarily, to move ahead with plans to impose mass firings of the federal workforce and reorganize various government agencies. The decision affects 19 federal agencies, as well as the White House-adjacent Office of Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management and U.S. DOGE Service. The court’s decision yesterday was a response to a ruling from California-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who blocked Trump’s plans in May, saying that while the president can seek to make changes to the workforce, there are limits when they are done wholesale. The Trump administration, however, argued that the president does not need permission from Congress to carry out his duties as stated in the Constitution. The justices made clear that their order is not about the legality of any individual agency reduction in force or reorganization plan, only the legality of Trump’s executive order and an administration memo related to workforce plans. Ketanji Brown Jackson, the only justice to provide a written dissent, sharply criticized the decision as “hubristic and senseless.” Read the full story here. Small-town hospitals are buckling under strain from Trump’s sprawling domestic policy bill, signed into law last week. It includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and could result in millions of Americans losing health care coverage. The package includes $50 billion for rural hospitals, though it won’t be enough to offset the Medicaid and ACA cuts, one expert said. Now, hospitals are already considering how to adapt to a shifting budget, even if some of the Trump bill’s changes won’t take effect for a few years. Some smaller hospitals are already closing their doors due to growing financial strain. The Nebraska-based Community Hospital said last week that it’s shutting down its medical center in Curtis, a town of around 900 people. In Hugo, Colorado, Kevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital and Care Center, said he may soon have to start cutting services for patients at the 25-bed rural hospital. And in Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, said he’s evaluating how the only hospital for many residents of South Central Kansas will be able to keep offering all of its services, which include hospice and home care, women’s health and pediatric care. Read the full story here. My cat Macaroni is pretty unusual, and not only because he can whine loud enough to be heard two floors down or because he’s missing a back left paw — but because he’s insured. Most pet owners don’t buy coverage for their animals. Of the nearly 90 million dogs and almost 74 million cats in the U.S., both species’ insured rates remain in the single digits. But that’s changing fast, as business intern Evie Steele reports. Spending on pet insurance has grown by at least 20% each year since 2020, hitting more than $4.7 billion last year, according to one industry estimate. Evie found consumers have strong opinions on whether pet insurance is worth it — most policies don’t cover pre-existing conditions — but analysts broadly expect the market to keep growing. — Rich Bellis, senior business editor The discounts are just starting on the second day of Amazon Prime Day.

Title: Sweeping Layoffs Hit Tech And Media Giants Citing AI Take Over

ByMartine Paris ByMartine Paris, Contributor. Learning to work with AI. With AI being credited for doing half the work at Salesforce by CEO Marc Benioff, a growing number of companies have been firing teams in response to the rise in AI adoption. Here’s a running list of layoffs. Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos space venture, is axing 1,000 jobs, nearly 10% of its workforce, to restructure for automation. Bumble is laying off 30% of its team, about 240 people, to better compete with AI-powered dating apps like Hinge. Business Insider is cutting 21% of its team as it goes all-in on AI to respond to the decline in Google search traffic. Dropbox downsized by 20% at the end of last year in its transition to AI offerings. Google, whose AI summaries are accelerating the demise of search traffic, has offered early retirement to its Search, Ads and Commerce teams. IBM slashed nearly 9,000 jobs, mostly in human resources as AI agents automate administrative tasks. Intel plans to layoff up to 20% of its factory workers as it pivots to AI. The company had over 100,000 employees at the end of last year. JPMorganChase is expecting a 10% reduction in operations staff as the company tells managers to do more with less, lean into AI, and focus on efficiencies. Meta is cutting 4,000 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, while doubling down on AI, poaching talent from OpenAI and hiring former Github CEO Nat Friedman to co-head its new Super Intelligence Labs with Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. Microsoft eliminated 15,000 jobs this year, nearly 7% of its workforce, despite strong earnings, with CEO Satya Nadella citing 20% to 30% of its code now being written by AI tools. Company-wide sales, marketing, product and engineering teams, gaming divisions including Xbox, and management layers across the board are getting slashed. Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI will wipe out half of all white collar jobs in the coming years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said AI could spike unemployment by 20%. And Nvidia just became the first-ever $4 trillion company. Clearly, this is just the beginning. Backlash has been significant against companies announcing AI-first strategies, like Duolingo, Klarna and Shopify, which were met with sharp criticism for suggesting contractors could be replaced by AI. Other tech giants have been scrambling with messaging. Amazon, which just celebrated deploying its 1 millionth robot in fulfillment centers, told Fast Company that despite widely reported rumors, it did not put 14,000 positions on the chopping block. And although Block, formerly known as Square, is eliminating 1,000 jobs, about 8% of staff, its co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the move is not to replace workers with AI. Despite mass layoffs, one engineer, Soham Parekh, managed not only to land several tech jobs, but work them simultaneously. He became a meme last week when his skill at beating the recruiting machine went viral. Amid the frenzy of posts were prominent AI investors Reid Hoffman and Mark Cuban. Box CEO Aaron Levie opined, “If Soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend.” Updated with Nvidia $4 billion market cap news.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Netflix Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BANGKOK, THAILAND - JUNE 27: The Netflix and Squid Game logos are seen in front of the Giant Swing ... More and Wat Suthat Thep Wararam in Bangkok, Thailand on June 27, 2025. Netflix Squid Game Season 3 has been released on June 27, 2025. (Photo by Valeria Mongelli/Anadolu via Getty Images) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is anticipated to announce its Q2 2025 earnings on Thursday, July 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenues are expected to reach approximately $11 billion for the quarter, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous year, while earnings are projected to be $7.06 per share, up from $4.88 during the same period last year. This growth is likely to be driven by recent price hikes and increasing advertising revenue. Earlier this year, Netflix raised the cost of its standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the price of the Premium plan to $25 per month. The company has also been concentrating on enhancing its advertising technologies, launching its in-house ad tech platform in the U.S. this past April. This initiative could help improve ad capabilities and pricing realizations. Year-over-year revenue comparisons will also benefit from stronger subscriber counts over the last year, partly driven by the crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of the ad-supported tier, even though the impact of these initiatives may start to lessen. We will also monitor Netflix's margins for the quarter closely. This year, Netflix's content costs are expected to increase. While the company has generally focused on scripted entertainment, it is currently branching out into live sports, which may entail higher production and licensing expenses. Netflix has a current market capitalization of $551 billion. Over the last twelve months, revenue totaled $40 billion, with the company being operationally profitable, reporting $11 billion in operating profits and net income of $9.3 billion. Therefore, if you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch.

NFLX 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not beneficial if the correlation is low) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. The correlation labeled 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.

In addition, if you're looking for upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Netflix, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception.

Title: See the billionaires and CEOs at the Sun Valley 'summer camp for billionaires' this year

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recently spoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last year expressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEO John Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO, Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president, Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president, Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are "enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Witz and her husband left lunch with a copy of Barry Diller's book, "Who Knew." Lütke and his wife, Fiona McKean, wore denim as they walked to a morning session at the conference. McKean wore a top from Finnish design house Marimekko. Kent layered a colorful outfit while his wife, Monica Meacci, stuck with an all-white look. Hastings was seen talking with Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, pictured at left here. Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, was also in attendance at the conference. Silver was seen carrying notes and a laptop as he walked around the conference grounds. Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took a phone call between sessions. Duolingo cofounder Luis von Ahn sported a casual look at the conference. Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp., the media conglomerate founded by Rupert Murdoch, wore jeans and plaid over a graphic tee. He accessorized with bracelets and a black News Corp hat. Jump to

Title: IROBOT ALERT: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Announces that a Class Action Lawsuit Has Been Filed Against iRobot Corporation and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

July 08, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: After Amazon's Hit Show, New Fallout Rumor Makes A Lot More Sense
URL: https://screenrant.com/fallout-games-multiple-projects-bethesda-leak/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
Although the franchise has always been an iconic pillar of the RPG genre, Amazon's Fallout show helped bring the series to a much wider audience of new viewers. Not only was the record-breaking series a hit with plenty of fans, but it also caused a massive spike in player counts for Bethesda's older Fallout games. Despite the show's significant success, Bethesda seemed somewhat unprepared to take advantage of the spike in popularity, which thankfully might be changing this second time around. While it will likely be a long wait until the highly anticipated Fallout 5 makes its appearance, official confirmation of a third season for Fallout means there won't be a content drought for too long. If its first season was anything to go by, the show's follow-ups are likely to be another smashing success for Amazon, which could have some significant benefits for Fallout players. Whether we'll be getting a look at the next entry in the series or some surprise projects, a recent report is a great sign of things to come. As reported by ComicBook, Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler made some significant claims regarding the future of the Fallout series after the recent layoffs at Xbox. As a guest on an episode of the Friends Per Second podcast, Middler claimed that "There are multiple Fallout projects in development," which he says includes "that one I'm sure you're all wanting". While the vague statements don't explicitly confirm any specific hopes for future Fallout content, it would honestly be more of a surprise if Bethesda didn't have more Fallout projects in the works. Although the vague rumor isn't too much to go on, the idea that we could see a new major release for the Fallout series following the second or third season of the Fallout show would be a more than welcome surprise. Even if Middler says that we're "not going to be playing this game anytime soon" regarding the biggest project from the studio, it's only a part of what's coming to the series in the future. Bethesda has confirmed the upcoming Fallout 5 won't be released until some time after the next Elder Scrolls game, so it's much more likely that the next big project for the series will be in the form of a remaster. Much like Bethesda's latest The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it's not hard to see a modern overhaul of Fallout New Vegas or the heavily rumored remake of Fallout 3 being a massive success for the studio. Even if Fallout 3 would be the more likely candidate given its in-house development at Bethesda, Fallout New Vegas is easily the more popular choice among fans, given its cult classic nature and significant ties to the show. Oblivion Remastered has been massively successful, and if a Fallout 3 remaster wants to achieve the same result, some changes will need to be made. While Bethesda may not be quite ready to announce a new sequel or even a remake by the time Fallout's second season rolls around, there's still plenty of room to take advantage of its popularity. Even mobile games like Fallout Shelter show just how much potential the series can have in other mediums, not to mention the Fallout 76 MMO still going strong years after release to show there's still plenty of love to be had for the Fallout franchise.

The best game of all time, according to Metacritic’s aggregated rankings, is overdue for a dethroning - but it probably won’t happen anytime soon. With 75 years of films under his cape, Superman has a huge cinematic legacy, including David Corenswet's newly-released debut as the Man of Steel. A controversial It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode from 15 years ago finally has a replacement in season 17's premiere episodes. There are quite a few ways to break Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and make every boss a breeze, but this Verso trick might take the cake. Two of Marvel's greatest villains fuse together to become a psychic anti-hero who could eliminate any threat by only thinking about it. The highly-anticipated third chapter of the rivalry between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano was streamed live on Netflix from Madison Square Garden.

The investment banking arm of TD Bank believes the market cap of JPMorgan will soar to $1 trillion as it leverages artificial intelligence (AI). In a new CNBC interview, TD Cowen bank analyst Steven Alexopoulos says investors are currently positioning in tech stocks to capture the upside potential of AI. The analyst notes that investors are likely underexposed to stocks that he thinks will rally once AI becomes widely adopted for commercial use. “When you think about where we are right now with AI, we’re at the builder level. The focus is Nvidia, the focus is OpenAI, the builders. I believe we’re inside of two years, maybe one, where the focus will widen out from the builders to who is going to use this technology to unlock massive economic value. That’s exactly what we saw on the internet. As the internet was being built, the focus was on Cisco, IBM, and as the layer was built, it moved to Google with search and Amazon selling commerce. When you think about the S&P 493… You need to focus on sectors that are reliant on people, knowledge workers, that is what will be disrupted by artificial intelligence.” According to the TD Cowen analyst, banks are poised to be major beneficiaries of AI advancements, with JPMorgan expected to lead the charge. Alexopoulos says that while JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake, expects the division’s headcount to decline by about 10% over the next five years, he believes that projection is conservative and anticipates a 20% reduction instead. According to Alexopoulos, JPMorgan’s growth will continue despite the significant drop in employee count. “[JPMorgan] is only richly valued relative to history, and that history did not include the most transformational technology of our lifetimes. Banks will break to a new valuation paradigm… By the end of next year, [JPMorgan] will be a trillion-dollar market-cap company.” As of Monday’s close, JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $811 billion.

Title: WEKA Debuts NeuralMesh Axon For Exascale AI Deployments
URL: https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/08/weka-debuts-neuralmesh-axon-for-exascale-ai-deployments.aspx
Time Published: 2025-07-08T17:54:00Z
Full Content:
WEKA unveiled NeuralMesh Axon, a breakthrough storage system that leverages an innovative fusion architecture designed to address the fundamental challenges of running exascale AI applications and workloads. NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly fuses with GPU servers and AI factories to streamline deployments, reduce costs, and significantly enhance AI workload responsiveness and performance, transforming underutilized GPU resources into a unified, high-performance infrastructure layer. Building on the company's recently announced NeuralMesh storage system, the new offering enhances its containerized microservices architecture with powerful embedded functionality, enabling AI pioneers, AI cloud and neocloud service providers to accelerate AI model development at extreme scale, particularly when combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stacks for advanced model training and inference optimization. NeuralMesh Axon also supports real-time reasoning, with significantly improved time-to-first-token and overall token throughput, enabling customers to bring innovations to market faster. AI Infrastructure Obstacles Compound at Exascale Performance is make-or-break for large language model (LLM) training and inference workloads, especially when running at extreme scale. Organizations that run massive AI workloads on traditional storage architectures, which rely on replication-heavy approaches, waste NVMe capacity, face significant inefficiencies, and struggle with unpredictable performance and resource allocation. The reason? Traditional architectures weren't designed to process and store massive volumes of data in real-time. They create latency and bottlenecks in data pipelines and AI workflows that can cripple exascale AI deployments. Underutilized GPU servers and outdated data architectures turn premium hardware into idle capital, resulting in costly downtime for training workloads. Inference workloads struggle with memory-bound barriers, including key-value (KV) caches and hot data, resulting in reduced throughput and increased infrastructure strain. Limited KV cache offload capacity creates data access bottlenecks and complicates resource allocation for incoming prompts, directly impacting operational expenses and time-to-insight. Many organizations are transitioning to NVIDIA accelerated compute servers, paired with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, to address these challenges. However, without modern storage integration, they still encounter significant limitations in pipeline efficiency and overall GPU utilization. Built For The World's Largest and Most Demanding Accelerated Compute Environments To address these challenges, NeuralMesh Axon's high-performance, resilient storage fabric fuses directly into accelerated compute servers by leveraging local NVMe, spare CPU cores, and its existing network infrastructure. This unified, software-defined compute and storage layer delivers consistent microsecond latency for both local and remote workloads-outpacing traditional local protocols like NFS. Additionally, when leveraging WEKA's Augmented Memory Grid capability, it can provide near-memory speeds for KV cache loads at massive scale. Unlike replication-heavy approaches that squander aggregate capacity and collapse under failures, NeuralMesh Axon's unique erasure coding design tolerates up to four simultaneous node losses, sustains full throughput during rebuilds, and enables predefined resource allocation across the existing NVMe, CPU cores, and networking resources-transforming isolated disks into a memory-like storage pool at exascale and beyond while providing consistent low latency access to all addressable data. Cloud service providers and AI innovators operating at exascale require infrastructure solutions that can match the exponential growth in model complexity and dataset sizes. NeuralMesh Axon is specifically designed for organizations operating at the forefront of AI innovation that require immediate, extreme-scale performance rather than gradual scaling over time. This includes AI cloud providers and neoclouds building AI services, regional AI factories, major cloud providers developing AI solutions for enterprise customers, and large enterprise organizations deploying the most demanding AI inference and training solutions that must agilely scale and optimize their AI infrastructure investments to support rapid innovation cycles. Delivering Game-Changing Performance for Accelerated AI Innovation Early adopters, including Cohere, the industry's leading security-first enterprise AI company, are already seeing transformational results. Cohere is among WEKA's first customers to deploy NeuralMesh Axon to power its AI model training and inference workloads. Faced with high innovation costs, data transfer bottlenecks, and underutilized GPUs, Cohere first deployed NeuralMesh Axon in the public cloud to unify its AI stack and streamline operations. "For AI model builders, speed, GPU optimization, and cost-efficiency are mission-critical. That means using less hardware, generating more tokens, and running more models-without waiting on capacity or migrating data," said Autumn Moulder, vice president of engineering at Cohere. "Embedding WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon into our GPU servers enabled us to maximize utilization and accelerate every step of our AI pipelines. The performance gains have been game-changing: Inference deployments that used to take five minutes can occur in 15 seconds, with 10 times faster checkpointing. Our team can now iterate on and bring revolutionary new AI models, like North, to market with unprecedented speed." To improve training and help develop North, Cohere's secure AI agents platform, the company is deploying WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon on CoreWeave Cloud, creating a robust foundation to support real-time reasoning and deliver exceptional experiences for Cohere's end customers. "We're entering an era where AI advancement transcends raw compute alone-it's unleashed by intelligent infrastructure design. CoreWeave is redefining what's possible for AI pioneers by eliminating the complexities that constrain AI at scale," said Peter Salanki, CTO and co-founder at CoreWeave. "With WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly integrated into CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure, we're bringing processing power directly to data, achieving microsecond latencies that reduce I/O wait time and deliver more than 30 GB/s read, 12 GB/s write, and 1 million IOPS to an individual GPU server. This breakthrough approach increases GPU utilization and empowers Cohere with the performance foundation they need to shatter inference speed barriers and deliver advanced AI solutions to their customers." "AI factories are defining the future of AI infrastructure built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and our ecosystem of NVIDIA Cloud Partners," said Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA. "By optimizing inference at scale and embedding ultra-low latency NVMe storage close to the GPUs, organizations can unlock more bandwidth and extend the available on-GPU memory for any capacity. Partner solutions like WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon deployed with CoreWeave provide a critical foundation for accelerated inferencing while enabling next-generation AI services with exceptional performance and cost efficiency." The Benefits of Fusing Storage and Compute For AI Innovation NeuralMesh Axon delivers immediate, measurable improvements for AI builders and cloud service providers operating at exascale, including:

A second 90-day extension on Paramount Global’s proposed merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media was triggered yesterday (July 7), giving regulators, company executives and the Federal Communications Commission more time to finalize and agree on the deal’s terms. One key hurdle remains: the FCC’s approval to transfer CBS’s broadcast licenses to Skydance, which must come from a commission currently led by Trump-appointed Republican Brendan Carr. Importantly, any ongoing negotiations will now play out against what’s presumed to be a more favorable regulatory climate, following Paramount’s controversial $16 million settlement with President Trump announced last week. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. That legal clash with the President stemmed from Trump’s lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been unfairly edited. The settlement, which has drawn sharp scrutiny, is just the latest twist in what’s been perhaps Paramount’s most turbulent year in recent memory—a saga that’s seen the company shift from Redstone family control to the edge of a new era under David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. For decades, Paramount embodied everything old Hollywood stood for, from its air of glamour to its dynastic leadership. This is the studio that gave moviegoers The Godfather and Top Gun and TV audiences hits like Cheers and Frasier. But with a merger in motion to hand the reins to Skydance, Paramount is now poised to become something very different: a tech-forward brand working to reinvent itself in an industry that’s long since moved on from the old rules. Needless to say, the road to this moment hasn’t been smooth. If anything, the story of how Paramount got here reads less like a typical business evolution and more like one of Taylor Sheridan’s soapy dramas on Paramount+, this one featuring a media dynasty clinging to power as its empire is carved up by outsiders. The $16 million settlement with Trump wasn’t just about clearing a legal hurdle; it was also seen as a way to neutralize a potential political threat. Inside Paramount, there were real fears that Trump could use regulatory leverage to derail the Skydance merger. That concern now seems far from hypothetical. On July 3, Trump appeared to confirm the existence of a “side deal” with Ellison that’s worth between $32 million and $35 million. He was referencing what Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino first reported as a private commitment by Ellison to run PSAs supporting Trump-aligned causes. Paramount has denied any knowledge of such an arrangement, but Trump’s comments are likely to intensify worries about editorial independence within CBS News. “What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king,” said Jon Stewart, whose The Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central, during a recent appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Stewart added that he, too, is bracing for whatever comes next: “I’m in a spot where I can do [The Daily Show] on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.” South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whose series streams on both Comedy Central and Paramount+, took to social media to slam the merger’s fallout for their show. “This merger is a [expletive] and it’s [expletive] up South Park,” they wrote in a post circulating on Instagram, responding to a delayed premiere announcement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.” The wheels for much of this were set in motion back in late 2023, when Skydance first began exploring a merger with Paramount Global. At the time, cord-cutting was accelerating, streaming losses were mounting, and Wall Street had largely lost faith in Paramount’s long-term strategy. Then–CEO Bob Bakish was holding merger talks with several potential partners, including Warner Bros. Discovery. But it was Skydance’s interest that kicked everything into gear. From the start, the deal was complicated by one name: Redstone. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, owns the family firm that effectively holds the keys to the company. Any buyer had to make her whole first, setting the stage for months of boardroom drama, internal power struggles and shareholder confusion. Skydance’s original offer, roughly $2 billion in cash and stock, triggered immediate backlash. Investors balked at the terms. Paramount’s special committee stalled. And in April 2024, Bakish was pushed out reportedly over disagreement with Redstone. The deal collapsed, and rival bidders began circling. Redstone seemed open to anything—until she wasn’t. Then, in a quiet but dramatic reversal, the Skydance talks were revived. This time, the restructured deal offered shareholders a better payout and a more straightforward path forward. By July 2024, an agreement was finalized: Skydance would merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction, ending the Redstone family’s decades-long grip on the studio. For many, the Redstones were synonymous with Paramount. Sumner Redstone built a sprawling media empire with ruthless focus. His daughter Shari spent years defending that legacy. But in the end, not even she could hold off the tide. Streaming hadn’t delivered, ad revenue was shrinking, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon were outpacing Paramount at every turn. David Ellison has laid out a vision centered on A.I.-assisted production, a renewed focus on tentpole films and reshaping Paramount+ into a leaner, more viable streaming platform. Still, major hurdles remain. Layoffs have already impacted hundreds. And whether Skydance can actually pull off a successful integration—blending old-school Hollywood with a tech-forward playbook—is far from guaranteed. Ellison and his team will face pressure from all directions: investors, regulators, unions and the press. But at least for now, for the first time in years, Paramount’s future is beginning to take shape—even if it means letting go of everything it once was.

Considering Fallout 76 debuted in 2018, fans of the post-apocalyptic RPG series are anxious for new quests. Although Bethesda has yet to confirm any release dates, rumors suggest that multiple games are in development. In the Friends Per Second podcast, Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle confirmed that Fallout 3 Remastered is still in the works. Fallout 5 is also planned, but may not arrive until 2030 or later. However, Middler also referenced a potential Fallout 2 remaster and New Vegas follow-up. Part of the broadcast centered on the recent turmoil in Xbox Game Studios. The loss of 9,000 Microsoft jobs impacted developers, leading to untimely deaths of titles like Perfect Dark. After the layoffs, Microsoft wants to focus on profitable Xbox titles and IPs, like Fallout. Fallout 3 Remastered may be one of the first projects that's ready for public consumption. It's believed that Obisidian Entertainment is partnering with Virtuous, who developed Oblivion Remastered. Still, initial leaks indicated a 2023 release date, and Bethesda hasn't provided an official update. When the title inevitably arrives, players can expect Unreal Engine 5 to power its revamped visuals. For fans who don't consider Fallout 76 a mainline game, it's been a decade since Fallout 4 arrived. Insiders don't anticipate Fallout 5 surfacing anytime soon. Sadly, Middler also doesn't see any evidence of rushed development. What's even more unclear is the timeline for other Xbox games hinted at in the podcast. Bethesda and Obsidian are considering various spinoffs and remasters. One project in particular could excite fans of the 2010 Fallout: New Vegas. For now, the TV show will have to tide supporters over until any new Fallout game is ready. The second season of the Amazon-produced series will premiere in December 2025.

U.S. equities were slightly lower at midday as the market weighed the potential impact of the latest Trump administration tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrials Average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down marginally. Shares of alternative energy firms, including Enphase Energy (ENPH), First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), dipped after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to slash most government support for the industry. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners declined along with the price of the precious metal as higher bond yields made gold a less attractive investment. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped on downgrades from HSBC, which warned it had become more cautious about bank stocks following their recent runup. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) shares gained on an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which brushed off previous concerns about the toolmaker's earnings revisions, and saw improvement in its end markets. U.S.-listed shares of Sequans Communications (SQNS) soared when the Paris-based manufacturer of semiconductors for the Internet of Things said it had raised $384 million to begin buying bitcoin. GlobalFoundries (GFS) shares jumped after the chipmaker bought artificial intelligence and processor IP supplier MIPS. The price was not given. Oil futures advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, and was little changed against the euro. Major cryptocurrencies mostly rose. TradingView

Title: A.I. Drives Job Cuts Across Silicon Valley Giants: By the Numbers

Tech layoffs are nothing new in Silicon Valley, a region long shaped by boom-and-bust hiring cycles, speculative investment and shifting economic conditions. But in recent months, executives have offered a different explanation for job cuts: the rapid rise of A.I. So far in 2025, nearly 400 tech companies have announced layoffs, affecting close to 94,000 employees, according to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker. Many of these roles are expected to be replaced—directly or indirectly—by A.I.-driven efficiencies. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Salesforce, for example, cut 1,000 roles earlier this year, redirecting hiring toward sales roles focused on A.I.-powered products. CEO Marc Benioff said last month that A.I. currently handles 30 to 50 percent of the company’s work, reducing the need for roles in fields like software engineering and customer support. Despite the job cuts, Salesforce remains financially strong, reporting $9.8 billion in revenue for the February-April quarter, an 8 percent year-over-year increase. Microsoft, the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, has also made significant cuts in 2025. The company laid off around 9,000 employees in July, following a separate round of more than 6,000 in May. Software engineers have borne the brunt of these reductions. Though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to A.I., the technology’s growing role inside the company is undeniable. In April, CEO Satya Nadella disclosed that A.I. now writes about 30 percent of Microsoft’s code—a figure he expects to climb. Microsoft isn’t alone in its internal shift toward A.I. At Google, well over 30 percent of new code includes A.I. generated suggestions, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed earlier this year. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has described developing an A.I. agent with coding abilities comparable to a mid-level engineer as one of the company’s top goals for 2025. Startups across Silicon Valley are following suit, increasingly requiring A.I. fluency in hiring and day-to-day operations. In a March memo to staff, Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke wrote that A.I. use is now “a fundamental expectation,” adding that any team requesting additional headcount or resources must first prove that the task can’t be handled by A.I. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn echoed a similar stance the following month. He told employees that headcount increases would only be approved if teams demonstrate the need for human involvement over automation. A.I. proficiency, he added, will also play a bigger role in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo will stop using contractors for tasks that A.I. can complete. With 2025 only halfway through, A.I.-driven workforce changes are poised to continue. In a June memo, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out the company’s sweeping integration of A.I. across areas like shopping, AWS, and internal operations. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time,” he wrote, “but in the next few years, we expect this will reduce our corporate workforce as we gain efficiency from using A.I. extensively across the company.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Own Gold, but Avoid the Golden Haircut

Time Published: 2025-07-08T13:52:22Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedJuly 8, 2025 Today, we’ll discuss why you should own gold. But first… Let’s say that you walk into a bank. You hand the teller a $10-bill and ask for a roll of quarters, worth $10. Seems easy, right? It’s no big deal. Perhaps you want some quarters in case you must feed a parking meter or use the washer-dryer machines at a laundromat. A basic roll of quarters, $10-worth… plus tax. So, the teller hands you a roll of quarters, smiles, and says, “Here you go. Oh, and there’s $0.60 tax, too. It’s the new, 6% sales tax on transactions.” And you say, “Huh? I’m just exchanging paper currency for metal coins. And there’s tax?” “Yup,” says the teller. “The state government just passed an act saying that this kind of exchange is a ‘transaction’ under commercial law, subject to sales tax. And we’re required to collect it.” You stand there, totally perplexed as in… You. Must. Be. Kidding. Well, yes and no. I’m sort of kidding, but I’m not really kidding because… Hey, welcome to Maryland. Okay, don’t panic (not yet). Because right now there’s no Maryland sales tax if you go to the bank and exchange paper currency for every-day, widely used coins like quarters. But there is a new 6% Maryland tax if you exchange dollars for gold. Call it the new, golden haircut. The tax applies even to gold coins issued by the U.S. Mint, the same federal entity that produces those (so far) untaxed quarters. But quarters are not made from gold, which for some bizarre reason Maryland thinks is alright to tax. It used to be that Maryland taxed sales of gold under $1,000, but not over that number. The idea was that anything over $1,000 was an investment, not subject to sales tax. As a matter of course, Maryland gold dealers typically explained to customers why they should buy at least a little bit over $1,000 of gold at a time. Say, $1,005 or $1,010. Avoid the sales tax. But as of July 1, 2025, buying all forms of gold in Maryland is subject to sales tax. For example, $1,000 of gold will cost you $1,060. Or $10,000 of yellow metal will set you back $10,600. Etcetera… Do the math. The government’s take is 6%. This is all part of a new tax bill from the collective geniuses who make laws from their political power perch in the state capital of Annapolis. This past spring, the legislature of the Terrapin State passed a so-called “Blueprint for Maryland’s Future,” loaded with all manner of new spending – upwards of $3 billion – on schools, teacher training, education-related grift, and innumerable other stuff. But there was a problem with the new spending bill; it’s that the state treasury lacks funds to pay for all these high and lofty ambitions. So the new bill also increased taxes on a long list of items, notably applying state sales taxes to gold bullion over that former $1,000 level. The state anticipates a haul of about $3 million per year (yes, million with an “m.”) In the runup to passing this new spend-and-tax bill, a coalition of Maryland businesses that sell gold coins and bullion lobbied against the idea. They noted the likely miniscule government take from the new tax, versus the hassle to businesses. Truly, it’s a small drop in a big bucket. This business group also made the obvious point that customers can easily drive across state lines and buy gold in jurisdictions without sales tax on the metal: Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware come to mind, as well as most of the rest of the country. Maryland gold buyers can always go elsewhere. When you consider that buying even a single, one-ounce U.S. gold Eagle coin involves handing over $3,500 or more, depending on dealer markup, it’s a stretch to believe that anyone will pay an extra 6% to conduct their gold business in Maryland. As even a casual glance at a map will show, geographically the state is perfectly shaped for its gold-buying citizens to drive up or down the proverbial road to somewhere else. And the Marylnd business coalition pointed out that the tax increase would likely wreck the in-state gold-selling aspect of many businesses by reducing volume, perhaps killing the gold-side entirely. And these businesses would possibly show less overall profitability, which means lower business taxes; that, and job losses, depending on how things work out. But no, the legislature didn’t absorb these arguments. Maryland raised the sales tax level for gold, and the future will unfold in its own way. Wait and see. In Maryland the government wants your money, and will do what it can to get your money. Yes, sure; that’s the case most everywhere, but very few other states tax gold sales. And even if the tax receipts don’t roll into Annapolis because the original scheme was kind of dumb to begin with, the collective political entity doesn’t particularly care. Perhaps you think that this news item doesn’t matter much because you don’t live in Maryland, nor buy gold there. And even if you live in Maryland, you’re more than willing to drive across the line to another state to buy your gold with no sales tax. Yes, fair enough… Then again, it’s no stretch to think that we may already be in the early innings of a dangerous political idea; namely, that governments everywhere – not just Maryland – are desperate for revenue, and they’re moving to tax gold sales, if not gold holdings. Because, to borrow a line from the old bank robber Willie Sutton, “That’s where the money is.” Clearly, in recent years the price of gold has moved up sharply. Just think back not-too-many years, to a time of gold at $1,250 per ounce, or $1,750 per ounce, or $2,250 per ounce. Indeed, for that last price, think back just a little over a year. By comparison, the current price of gold is north of $3,300 and rising. There’s little downside, and big blue sky above. Here at Paradigm Press, our own Jim Rickards believes that gold prices will climb up and over $4,000 per ounce by the end of the year, meaning within the next six months. Plus, until quite recently and at the retail level (at least in the U.S.), only quirky gold bugs bought gold. Owning a stash was more of a curiosity than a financial norm. But now, and for many reasons, more people are literally buying gold; even Costco sells it, and the giant, consumer-facing, mass-retail chain can’t keep it in stock. Any way you look at it, these cumulative gold sales involve growing numbers of people and represent a lot of money, which tends to attract politicians and tax collectors. Of course, there’s more to the gold story than coin shops and/or Costco. And for all the media coverage of gold, it appears that most American politicians really don’t get the monetary angle. They lack sufficient education and perspective on money even to process what’s happening with dollars and by extension with gold. That is, at numerous levels America’s government doesn’t understand its own money. In previous articles I’ve discussed how the price of gold is NOT moving higher because armies of retail buyers are mobbing the coin shops of America. No, gold has moved higher in price because central banks across the world (well, central banks outside of America) are buying metal by the tonne. Think of Russia, China, India, and dozens of other nations; first, they are de-dollarizing, and second, seek the security of gold in the vaults versus the risk of U.S. Treasuries subject to the whims of American politics and politicians. Slowly but surely, the global monetary system is headed for a reset. It may not be next week or next month, but something is coming. Meanwhile the U.S. government, via out-of-control spending and expansive monetary policy, is ruining its own currency. And this brings us back to an old, sturdy piece of wisdom, that “Gold is money,” according to banker J.P, Morgan, who made the remark over 115 years ago. “Everything else is credit,” he added. J.P. Morgan, American banker. Wiki Commons. Indeed, Morgan was testifying before Congress about how he bailed out the U.S. government from a financial Panic in 1907-08, and at the time all American politicians understood what he meant. In that era, America and the world were on a gold standard, and it was a given that gold was the foundation of wealth. Today, we’re five generations post-Morgan. Very few people have an inherent understanding of the gold standard. Very few colleges or universities teach much of anything about gold, outside the geology department. And in the West in general, and the U.S. in particular, studying gold as money is an arcane idea, kind of like a branch of economic archaeology. Modern American culture has become fully dollarized and financialized, courtesy of the Federal Reserve and its notes, which are basically just entries in a ledger book or electronic equivalent. The term commonly used is “money creation” from the Fed, as if wealth can be generated by willing it into existence versus delivering some article or service of value. Ideally, the Fed should create dollars only in enough quantity to reflect the true growth in productivity and material wealth of the internal American economy, plus the value of imports. But in practice, the Fed has created far more dollars than America (or the world) has created wealth over the past century, which is why a current dollar is worth about 2-cents from, say, 1914. In these respects, it’s fair to say that the American governing class has little to no understanding of the meaning of money itself; the politicians are just counting the Niagara of dollars that flow through the economy, in so far as that can even be correctly measured. And they’re grabbing for dollars in any tax scheme they can conjure up. I’ll wrap up by returning to the story of Maryland and its new tax on gold. The state wants to collect sales tax when people exchange fiat-money dollars for real-money gold. In essence, it’s a penalty on foresighted people who see problems ahead and want to exit the dollar system for the hard-money comfort and security of gold. Yes, sure; Maryland needs the money to fund the dreams of its silly politicians. But no, this doesn’t mean that you must play the game. Get your gold, put it away somewhere safe, don’t discuss it, and preserve your wealth until our cultural craziness plays out. That’s all for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

July 08, 2025 08:48 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Rumors are swirling that Jeff Bezos might acquire Condé Nast, Vogue's parent company, as a wedding gift for Lauren Sanchez. This speculation is fueled by Sanchez's recent Vogue cover, hand-picked attire by Anna Wintour, and Wintour's departure as Editor-in-Chief. Insiders suggest Wintour may be brokering the deal, potentially benefiting from her equity in the company, despite denials from Bezos's camp.

US stock market steadied Tuesday as Trump's tariff deadline delay gave investors hope for new global trade deals. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures showed modest movement after Trump extended the July 9 tariff start date to August 1, offering trading partners more time to negotiate. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia now have breathing space to respond. While markets remain cautious, the delay sparked optimism that Trump’s firm-yet-flexible stance may open the door for diplomatic progress. Investors now await the Fed minutes and Delta’s earnings to see what’s next for the economy.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Tesla’s troubles go far beyond CEO Elon Musk’s recent dust-up with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” in a social media slap fight over the weekend. But while the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. And the company could even be back to losing money, for reasons unrelated to Musk’s personal politics. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the 2024 campaign, and was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term, with his role in slashing the federal workforce at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But Musk has since announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then. Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8%, as investors were concerned about the implication of Musk’s latest political moves, despite his promises to re-focus on the company. It rebounded only 1.3% in Tuesday trading. “Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company. Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future. “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote. Still, Ives maintained his buy recommendation and $500 price target for the stock in his note. But analysts at William Blair cut their recommendation on the stock to “market perform” or neutral, and also cut their earnings forecast for the company. Because even without the political stink, the Tesla’s financial outlook is suddenly looking notably worse. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. But when Ives posted his belief that the Tesla board should tie Musk’s future pay package to the amount of time he spends at Tesla and have oversight of his political “endeavors,” Musk responded with his own post on X, saying “Shut up, Dan.” Blair’s note pointed out that Trump’s bill not only removed the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, but also eliminated the financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions targets. Emissions fines have historically forced automakers who still build primarily gasoline powered cars and trucks to buy “regulatory credits” from EV companies. Removing those fines eliminates “market demand for Tesla’s credits,” said the note from William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter. The sale of those federal and state credits added $10.6 billion to Tesla’s bottom line since 2019 and often enabled the company to post a profit. Without the revenue from those regulatory credits, the company would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021, and it would have been back in the red again in the first quarter of this year, when its net income plunged 71% compared to a year earlier on sharply lower sales around the globe. Musk has largely downplayed all the recent bad news, saying the company’s future rests on robots, artificial intelligence and self-driving taxis. But the company’s taxi service is very limited to date, launching only in Austin, Texas, for a select group of customers – mostly Tesla fans – and with a Tesla employee riding in the front passenger seat to monitor the car’s performance. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix – by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet. And Tesla’s rollout has had its shares of problems, including a video showing a robotaxi traveling on the wrong side of the road for about half of a block and another video of a robotaxi slowly turning its front wheels into a parked car. While Musk has promised his robotaxi service will be expanding soon across many other cities, he has not given any further details. He also hasn’t said when the Austin service will be expanded to the general public, nor when the company’s human monitors sitting in the front passenger seat will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, Waymo has definitive plans to expand its service to Miami and Washington, DC, next year in partnership with Uber. “We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk’s attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,” said the William Blair note. “We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.” Then there’s the problem of Tesla’s sales. Or rather, the lack thereof. Global sales were down a record 13% in each of the first two quarters of this year, compared to a year earlier, even though demand for EVs overall continues to climb, a further sign of Tesla’s declining market share. Part of the lost EV market share is due to increased competition, both from Western automakers rolling out their own EV offerings, and Chinese automakers that have made a massive push into the market. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US. Demand is likely to weaken further come October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers expires. When a previous version of the tax credit was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company had to cut the price of the car by about half the value of the lost credit. Tuesday Tesla posted on X that “If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it’s now,” referencing the upcoming tax credit expiration and using the acronym for “you only live once.” But Tesla has also faced missteps of Musk’s own doing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales. That is likely to continue even as he moves to distance himself from Trump. In the early months of this year, hundreds of protests were held outside Tesla showrooms in the United States, Canada and Europe. Worries about self-inflicted brand damage started the company’s shares on their downward slide. It prompted Trump, who was still Musk’s ally at the time, to announce he was buying a Tesla for himself. In March, the president hosted an event at the White House urging others to buy the company’s cars. At one point, Musk and Tesla investors might have hoped that in a closely divided country, the lost sales to Trump critics might be at least partly made up for by sales to Trump fans. But Musk seems to now face the possibility of backlash from both sides of the political spectrum. “He’s been able to alienate everyone, which many thought was impossible, but he’s actually been able to do it,” Ives told CNN Monday. “And the problem is, this soap opera just keeps going on.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Feedback Loops, Not Dashboards, Drive Real CX Insights

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Metrics miss why. Behavioral data tracks what happened, but it rarely explains why customers act or leave. Feedback loops fill in those gaps. Ask, act, announce. Closing the loop requires three steps. Ask customers, act on input, and announce what changed. Most firms stop after the first step. Feedback builds trust. People don’t resist sharing opinions. They resist being ignored. Timely follow-up turns feedback into trust and stronger retention. Companies track click-through rates, build dashboards of behavioral data and run attribution models. Yet, many skip the simplest step of asking customers what they think. This habit reflects the deeper problem of metric fixation. Leaders chase numbers that are easy to collect, but those figures rarely explain why people buy, stay or leave. Studies show response rates for large federal surveys have fallen from 70% to under 40%, and executives point to “survey fatigue” as proof that asking questions no longer works. That excuse hides the real issue. People are not tired of sharing opinions; they are tired of feeling ignored. When feedback disappears into a black hole, trust erodes. When companies listen and act, participation rebounds. In other words, the flaw is not in asking but in how businesses treat the answers. This breakdown reveals the missing piece and shows how firms that close the feedback loop outperform those that only track clicks. We’ll cover shifting market trends, examine a real-world turnaround and end with a step-by-step plan you can use now. This will help you understand why moving from passive metrics to active conversation helps you measure what truly matters and build relationships that last. Companies that master feedback do not send longer surveys. They design shorter, smarter questions, time them to key moments and, most importantly, show customers how their comments drive change. The payoff is clear. It’s higher retention, stronger lifetime value and a culture that values listening over guessing. Most organizations rely on indirect signals to gauge engagement. They watch open rates, dwell time, net promoter scores and conversion funnels. Then they infer satisfaction from the movement of those lines. This approach feels scientific, but it hides three big flaws. Understanding the trade-offs between behavioral data and direct feedback reveals why active loops drive deeper insight and action. Amperity's 2024 analysis of global consumer retail and hospitality brands found that companies misidentify 23% of their most valuable customers, the very individuals responsible for over half their revenue. They focus on surface-level optimizations like faster page load times or shorter forms, yet customer defection continues. That is because behavioral data only reveals what has already happened. Cart abandonment or subscription cancellation becomes visible only after the damage is done. Direct questions, on the other hand, uncover intent earlier, before disengagement turns into loss. TruRating, a customer feedback platform, specializes in capturing simple, targeted feedback at the point of payment by asking just one question during checkout. This minimalist approach has proven highly effective, and it delivers response rates of over 80% in-store and 50% online. The results speak for themselves. TruRating clients have reported revenue increases of up to 8% after implementing changes based on the insights gathered. With more than 500 million pieces of customer feedback as of 2023, TruRating demonstrates that single-question feedback systems are not only scalable but also capable of driving measurable business impact. Metric fixation offers speed and simplicity but sacrifices depth and accuracy. It is like steering a car by watching the speedometer while ignoring the road. To fix the problem, we need to add a missing ingredient that brings customer voice back into the equation. Closing the loop requires moving beyond simple surveys to act on customer insights and communicate outcomes. The missing ingredient is an active feedback loop with three steps. Those are ask, act and announce. Most companies handle the first step, ask, by using surveys or pop-up forms. Only a few move to the second step, act, where teams review feedback, identify root causes and fix problems. Even fewer complete the third step, announce, by telling customers what changed because of their input. Why does this loop matter? It turns data into dialogue. When customers see that their voice sparks action, they feel valued and stay engaged. Zendesk found that a follow up within 48 hours doubles future survey responses and cuts churn by 30%. Active loops close the “why” gap left by behavioral metrics. Imagine a streaming service noticing a spike in mid-season drop-off. Usage data flags the episode where viewers quit; feedback explains the exit: too many product placements broke immersion. Start with a single, context-specific question placed at a high-impact moment. Route responses to a cross-functional team that can act quickly on experience, messaging and policy. Next, send a concise thank you, share what you learned and outline the first change you will make. Six weeks later, update participants on progress. A common mistake is to release new features and celebrate them without listening to customer feedback. Maybe you should consider addressing the issues your customers are facing before releasing new features and benefits. I use one tool to build emails and one tool only, Stripo. It is the most flexible editor I have ever used. But what really sets it apart is how they handle feedback. When you request a new feature or report a bug, they respond, tell you when they will fix it and actually follow through. I have seen real changes happen based on my input. It does not make me feel special. It makes me feel heard, not to mention the fact it makes my life easier. Other companies tell me they will put my suggestion on their “product roadmap” that they “take very seriously.” Roadmap or no, it feels like I’m just being pushed aside. Technology streamlines every step. Modern voice of the customer platforms tag themes, flag urgent issues and trigger tickets. AI sentiment analysis highlights emotional drivers that correlate with churn. Tech also tracks how many suggestions led to real change, which reinforces accountability. Do not over-promise. Focus on a few high-impact fixes per cycle. Do not ask questions you will not address. Finally, do not collect feedback just to check a box. If customers take the time to respond, they should see something change as a result. Active feedback loops do more than patch problems; they create a culture of listening. A few market shifts make active feedback loops essential. Privacy rules reduce passive tracking. As cookies fade, direct questions respect consent. Meanwhile, the demand for personalization has been rising. According to Accenture, 91% of people say they are more likely to shop with brands that recognize them and offer helpful suggestions, and 83% are willing to share their data if it helps make that happen. Another big market shift is that AI requires qualitative fuel. Large language models mine comment text for insight unavailable in clicks alone. Finally, don’t forget that social media amplifies voices. Forty-eight percent of online consumers have left a negative review online. Private loops solve issues before they go public. Forward-looking brands already benefit. SMS surveys achieve up to 45% response rates for Shopify customer feedback collection, with a read rate of 98%. When Delta implemented new customer survey software from Medallia, the company saw response rates double compared to their existing questionnaires during the initial testing period. Failing to adapt means flying blind as privacy rules tighten and dashboards lose fidelity. Active loops keep you aligned with consent-based data and evolving customer demands. Related Article: The State of Consumer Data Privacy Legislation in 2025 Common objections include the belief that annual surveys are enough because issues evolve quickly, but week-to-week changes demand timely feedback. Some worry customers will not respond, yet short questions at the right moment and visible follow-up drive higher response rates. Others cite a lack of analysis resources, yet freemium AI tools can tag themes in minutes. Scale is no longer a barrier. Amazon processes approximately 10 million customer opinions monthly through seller feedback alone, which demonstrates how large-scale operations can still maintain responsive customer engagement. Across industries, companies that close the feedback loop achieve significant measurable improvements. Research shows an average six-point net promoter score increase when organizations actively respond to customer feedback. Companies that close the loop with customers reduce their churn by a minimum of 2.3% annually, while those that don't close the loop increase their churn by at least 2.1% every year. Also, when it comes to revenue impact, upselling strategies informed by customer feedback can lead to revenue increases of 10-30% on average. Businesses see up to a 20% increase in customer lifetime value when implementing effective feedback-driven upselling approaches. Firms that cite loop programs on earnings calls often enjoy higher valuations. In 2009, Domino's Pizza was facing a severe brand crisis. The company was plagued by widespread customer dissatisfaction, with complaints describing their pizza as having "sauce that tasted like ketchup" and "crust that tasted like cardboard." Customer feedback was overwhelmingly negative, with frequent complaints about taste and quality. The company ranked last in a 2009 consumer taste preference survey, tied with Chuck E. Cheese. Sales were stagnant, customer satisfaction was at an all-time low, and the brand had developed a reputation for subpar food quality. Social media complaints and negative word-of-mouth were actively driving customers away. The company's stock price had fallen to $6.87 by Dec. 31, 2009, and same-store sales declined for the first time in company history in 2008, continuing into 2009. Domino’s Pizza collected customer criticism across surveys, reviews, social media and employee input. They publicized harsh feedback verbatim in national commercials to demonstrate accountability. They then launched the “Pizza Turnaround” campaign with the CEO openly acknowledging past failures. Next, they reformulated core recipes, including new sauce, a new cheese blend and garlic-seasoned crust. They retrained staff through comprehensive training programs to improve quality and consistency, and they upgraded delivery systems and kitchen equipment to support operational improvements. Streamlining processes allowed them to address service issues and improve overall efficiency. Significantly, they created a transparent communication system outlining changes, timelines and quality goals, and they released behind-the-scenes footage documenting the recipe and quality transformation. Through their “Oh Yes We Did” campaign, they reinforced their turnaround and ongoing commitment. Stock price rose from $6.87 in 2009 to $426.77 by 2024, a 6,200%+ increase, and U.S. market share grew from 9% to 15%. Q1 2010 same-store sales jumped 14.3%, the highest in company history at that time, and full-year 2010 same-store sales grew 9.9%. In 2010, Domino’s achieved its first positive domestic store growth since 2007, and they rebranded from “last resort” to the world’s second-largest pizza chain. They shifted their identity to a technology-driven company, with digital roles comprising half of HQ staff, and they rebuilt customer loyalty and established a stronger foundation for sustainable growth. The Domino's case demonstrates that radical transparency, comprehensive operational changes and authentic customer engagement can drive remarkable business turnarounds even when starting from a severely damaged brand position. First, set a clear objective; choose one journey stage to improve. Next, map the moment; position the prompt seconds after that stage ends. Then craft a microsurvey using plain language, with one rating question and an optional comment. Fourth, choose a channel; match customer preference, whether that’s SMS, in-app, email or kiosk. Fifth, build a response team and give them the authority to act. Next, close the loop publicly; you can thank them 48 hours later and update customers once changes go live. Finally, measure and iterate. Track response, resolution time and business outcome. You can expand your strategy once targets are hit. Some optional enhancements to this roadmap include incentivizing first-time responses with points or donations, localizing questions to key languages and rotating open-text prompts each quarter. However, remember not to survey your customers about things you can’t deliver on. Start on freemium tools; upgrade to sentiment analysis and CRM integration as volume grows. Create a feedback council to standardize libraries and share wins. Momentum beats perfection. Within a year, you can evolve from reactive support to proactive experience design that only includes one question, one action and one announcement at a time. Customer insight is not a data problem. It’s a trust problem. Customers are not reluctant to share; they are reluctant to repeat themselves. They will offer feedback but only when it feels like a conversation. They want to know that their answers will lead to action. The data supports this. Short, well-timed questions earn strong response rates, and companies that close the loop turn those responses into higher retention, greater revenue and a more resilient customer base. This is what happens when organizations stop guessing and start asking. Direct feedback delivers results when it is treated as input for action, not just another metric to monitor. One honest answer from a customer at the right moment can reveal more than weeks of behavioral data. You do not need to build a complex feedback architecture to begin. Ask one meaningful question. Fix one visible issue. Communicate one tangible change. Then ask again. That is how trust is built and rebuilt. If your company cannot act on customer input today, it is not ready for customer retention strategies, personalization or AI automation. But if you can respond to one piece of feedback right now, you are further ahead than most. Listening is not a campaign; it is a commitment. Active feedback is the foundation of sustainable growth.

Title: WOLF Stock To $20?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Wolfspeed, Inc. logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, United ... More States, on January 3, 2025. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) While Wolfspeed faces severe financial challenges, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story that could deliver exceptional returns for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet on the company’s survival and recovery. The appointment of Gregor van Issum as CFO sparked immediate investor confidence, driving the stock price up 2x following the announcement. Van Issum brings substantial semiconductor industry experience from his previous roles at ams-OSRAM and NXP, two respected players in the sector. His track record suggests he understands the complexities of semiconductor operations and financial management. Now, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process has already delivered significant improvements to Wolfspeed’s financial structure. The company expects to eliminate nearly $4.6 billion in debt (70% reduction) and cut annual interest payments by 60%, dramatically improving its cost structure and cash flow dynamics. Wolfspeed operates in the silicon carbide semiconductor space, which offers superior energy efficiency compared to traditional silicon chips. This technology is increasingly critical for electric vehicle applications, positioning the company in a high-growth market segment. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – MSFT Stock To $1,000? If Wolfspeed successfully navigates its financial restructuring and executes its turnaround plan, the upside potential is substantial: The Wolfspeed turnaround story represents a classic high-risk, high-reward investment scenario. While the potential upside is substantial if the company successfully executes its restructuring and capitalizes on the growing silicon carbide market, the probability of success remains uncertain given the company’s operational challenges and competitive pressures. Investors considering this opportunity should view it as a speculative position suitable only for those who can absorb complete loss while recognizing that successful turnarounds in distressed technology companies can generate exceptional returns for those willing to accept the substantial risks involved. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

HuffPost may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Shopping Writer for HuffPost With tariffs still threatening to make products more expensive, 2025’s Prime Day deals couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s worth jumping on big sales when they appear so you aren’t stuck paying significantly higher prices on items like personal electronics, tools and foreign goods with the fluctuating economy. According to previous HuffPost coverage, price hikes can affect multiple categories, including tech, major kitchen appliances, Korean skin care and more. Products in all of these categories are on sale for Prime Day July 8 through 11, so we rounded up some of the best deals to help you save on these investments and prevent yourself from having to pay even higher prices for the items you want. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Duracell batteries probably need no introduction. Plenty of emergency tools are battery-operated in the event that you either lose power or are somewhere without electricity entirely, so having batteries on hand is always a smart idea. These ones are made to last 12 years in storage, so you can save them for way down the line and rest assured they'll still work. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. This sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including pollen, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 867 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. It comes in black and white and measures 16.8 inches by 18.3 inches by 9.7 inches. When it comes time to replace filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year) the process couldn’t be any easier, and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. And when it comes to ratings, the Coway Mighty has earned an overall 4.6 stars from 27,000+ shoppers. With an IP67 waterproof rating and an up-to-5-hour battery life, this palm-sized Bluetooth speaker is a outdoor must-have – and at only $30 right now, it's a complete steal. Reviews on the sound quality are overwhelmingly positive, too. “After months of hemming and hawing about this purchase, I impulse-bought this speaker from my neighborhood electronics store and I do not regret it one bit,” wrote shopping managing editor Emily Ruane. “My kids love listening to music while we walk to school (or now, camp) and my husband or I will often play it directly on our phones, but the sound quality and logistics there are not ideal because the kids always want to hold the phone. Now, they love holding the speaker – and fighting over who gets to hold it, of course – and blasting Black Sabbath or the ‘Frozen’ soundtrack while we stroll along. I love that its waterproof, too – this means we will be able to listen to podcasts during bathtime, which is one of our favorite evening activities.” Come on now. At this point, you know all about Apple's AirTags. If you already use them, then you know that their ability to help you track and recover everything from your keys to your phone to your cat is pretty priceless. If you're new here, then here’s how they work: Each AirTag can ping its own location, so when you attach it to one of your belongings, you can track that item via Apple’s Find My app, which is available in the cloud and on Apple devices like iPhones, laptops and more. Through Find My, you can even tell your AirTag to play a sound so it’s easier to find. People love these things for a reason and they're always finding new ways to get the best out of them. They're 29% off list price for Prime Day week but we don't know how many days they'll be discounted, so grab 'em while they're hot! Promising review: "Excellent for tracking luggage when you travel multiple days. My new use is when waiting at airport for luggage, you can get a sense when they will arrive on carrier or if you ship luggage to next hotel, you know they have arrived before your arrival." — Leonard Tsai The Laniege lip sleeping mask earned its rightful place in the cult beauty hall of fame long ago, but since then, the brand has birthed a new viral contender in the form of a squeezable and juicy balm that's formulated for swiping on the lips any time of day. Available in several flavors, this nourishing and shine-inducing formula is enriched with shea and seed butters for lips that are softer, more hydrated and youthful. If you still want the original lip mask that started it all, it's also on sale for Prime Day for 30% off. If you’re looking for a survival tool for home power outages, remote and outdoor living or maybe even your RV, then the gas-free Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is one reliable powerhouse. This portable generator has also become a HuffPost reader favorite and it’s so powerful that one reviewer says it was able to run a full-size fridge and a few fans overnight. This backup generator has one 1000W AC outlet for powering home appliances and other devices, and it can fully charge up for use in 5.5 hours when plugged into an electrical outlet. It also includes a solar panel. It’s ideal for camping trips plus unexpected power outages related to the heat, storms or other extreme weather circumstances. The generator has two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC ports, along with LED lights. This HuffPost-reader favorite device is useful for keeping devices juiced on the go, so if you always have a low phone battery, this should help out. While most power banks are bulky and inconvenient to carry, this versatile keychain portable charger by Rorry is slim, small and easy to tote. The charger clips right onto a carabiner, bag, backpack or belt loop for easy access, and right now it’s on sale for 20% off. Nab it in your favorite color! Apple products, especially AirPods, have been known to sell out on Prime Days past, so get them while you can. These popular AirPods are equipped with Apple's H2 chip, which aids in more intelligent and dynamic noise cancellation that's two times stronger than the previous iteration. The immersive audio senses your head movements to provide rich surround sound, and you can enjoy up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case. Dr. Jart's Cicapair color correcting treatment has long been touted as a temporary cure-all for skin that's red and irritated, without needing a stitch of foundation or concealer. The secret is this green-to-beige cream pays homage to a traditional Korean beauty ingredient called centella asiatica, or tiger grass. It is an ultra-soothing and reparative grass that can help to rapidly neutralize redness, making it a great product for people that have rosacea, keratosis pilaris and acne-prone skin. Plus, it also has SPF 30, which is great for daily use and adds another level of protection. It's very rarely on sale, in fact, the last time the price was this low was last year's Prime Day! HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective. Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval. This 10-liter air fryer has 17 preset settings and three racks, with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees. You can bake, air fry, dehydrate or even used the included rotisserie spit to cook a rotisserie chicken. There's also a drip tray to catch messes on the bottom and make cleanup easier. You can clean the air in rooms up to 1,076 feet with this large room air purifier, which has dual air intakes to purify twice as fast (it only needs 60 minutes for a room that size). It operates nearly silent at just 24 dB, and you can choose between four fan speeds or just set it to automatic mode and let it choose for you based on the air quality. There's also a timer with three settings, so you can set it and forget it. The air purifier comes in black or white. Made by the K-beauty company Medicube, this collagen face mask is made to be worn over and can boost your skin's elasticity while you sleep. In addition to collagen, the mask contains skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerin and ceramide NP for hydration, skin barrier maintenance, addressing fine lines and other benefits. The mask dries down in 15 minutes and is designed to peel off easily in one piece for little mess. These sport earbuds are worn over the ear to keep from falling out, and are especially great for runners, campers or anyone who might fear losing an earbud while they're moving around. Available in six fun colors, the earbuds come in a charging case that has a dual LED display so you can always know the battery level. The earbuds boast up to eight hours of listening time on a single charge and a Bluetooth range of 33 feet. More advanced than your average speaker, this amplifier can upgrade your home entertainment system with 60 watts per channel by connecting to your TV, record player and other speakers. The amp is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and you can stream Spotify, Amazon Music and more directly from it. You can use the WiiM app to adjust the volume and other settings from anywhere. Having an extra screen can help you see everything at once when you're working on a computer or smaller device. This Arzopa monitor has a 1080P, 15.6-inch display that can connect to your other devices with a USB-C cable. The monitor has a dual speaker system to deliver powerful audio, and can connect to a Mac, PC, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and more. Great for a small space like an apartment, dorm or even RV, this portable dishwasher can go right on the countertop and can hold up to two full place settings, or 30+ items. It only consumes 6 liters of water per cycle using the built-in tank, and has five washing programs in addition to an auto-open function and a UV sterilization function. You can even use this to wash fruit. You might be familiar with Cosrx's snail mucin essence, which we've covered here at HuffPost many times. But the essence isn't the only snail mucin product out there — Cosrx also makes this snail mucin moisturizer, which we found to be at a steeper discount. The cream has 92% snail mucin for moisturizing and exfoliating, along with hyaluronic acid. The cream is lightweight and can address redness, dryness and even acne scars. Get two gadgets in one with this dual air purifier and fan from Dyson. The fan circulates air and keeps you cool while the purifier works to trap pollutants in the HEPA filter. You can use Dyson's app to track changes in air quality and pre-set the machine for intervals between 30 minutes and 8 hours. The fan also features a night mode that operates more quietly so it won't disturb your sleep. The Google Nest Thermostat allows you to track your energy consumption, offers recommendations for when it's best to use in-house heating or cooling systems, as well as offers complete control of a home's temperature even when users aren't at home. The thermostat is designed to work without a C wire in most homes and doesn't require professional help to install nor the need for any other Google smart home devices. A lesser known — but perhaps just as good as — alternative to the uber-expensive Dyson Airwrap is the Shark FlexStyle multi-styler, a tool that utilizes the same reverse directional airflow technology and functionality as the famed predecessor, but with some added ergonomic differences. The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls. This tool comes with up to five attachments to meet your styling needs whether you're creating bouncy curls, salon-style blowouts or smoothing frizz. Promising review: "I have been using this beautiful instrument for the past few months and I have to say it is definitely a major time saver in the morning.It’s pretty easy to find your groove with the tool after the first few uses. I will say the handle is long with the curling attachment so I just adjust my grip towards the center of the handle and it actually feels way more balanced. Definitely a tool I enjoy to use for my hair and would recommend!" — Ben This well-known stick vacuum from Dyson makes vacuuming easier than ever thanks to its lightweight body and extra-portable cordless design, with two powerful cleaning modes so you can tailor its suction to the job at hand while enjoying up to 40 minutes of cord-free runtime. Those with pets (or long hair) will also appreciate how effectively this thing traps fur and hair without getting strands tangled in its brush. Plus, it's designed to capture an impressive 99.99% of dust and other allergens in its filter for a cleaner home and cleaner air. Bose infused its signature high-fidelity sound and powerful noise-canceling technology into these over-the-ear wireless headphones that offer 20 hours of listening per charge. Enjoy 11 levels of active noise canceling and a microphone system that allows you to take calls and be heard, even in noisy environments. K-beauty brand Anua makes this pore control cleansing oil with heartleaf, a Southeast Asian plant that has anti-inflammatory properties. You can use it to remove makeup or SPF, or as part of a double-cleansing routine to prevent your pores from clogging. According to the brand, you may begin to see a decrease in your skin's production of sebum (the oily substance your skin produces that can clog and cause breakouts) in as little as four weeks. Instantly get coffee shop-quality espresso in the comfort of your home with this wildly popular full-service espresso machine. Lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos and espresso shots are pulled to precision alongside a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds beans on demand and a frother wand for making perfectly delicious steamed milk.It’s the stuff coffee dreams are made of. HuffPost Shopping managing editor Emily Ruane raves about this Breville machine. “I did as much research as I could and this model seemed to be a popular and well-reviewed option,” she said. “The Breville was pricy, but it gets used at least twice a day. I wake up every morning looking forward to a perfect latte and I truly feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this convenience at home.” Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speaker is an outdoor-ready and super portable device that delivers crystal-clear sound with enhanced bass and zero distortion thanks to an advanced digital signal processor. This 12W speaker is also completely waterproof so you can enjoy up to 24 hours of listening time per charge no matter where you are. It's possible you've seen some version of these overnight hydrogel masks on TikTok that start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into skin, leaving behind a complexion that's plump, hydrated and glass-like. These Biodance masks contain a collagen-peptide that's of a low molecular weight to penetrate deeper into the skin. It also has brightening niacinamide, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and galactomyces to improve skin tone and texture. These high-quality headphones are currently retailing for just $35. Enjoy up to 32 hours of battery life and if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes. Make calls on the go with a “VoiceAware” program that lets you limit how much of your own voice you hear as you talk. These earbuds are water and dust-resistant, perfect for taking on the trail, mowing the lawn or using while working out or working at your desk. When it comes to quickly brewed single-serve coffee, no one does it like Keurig, and their K-Elite model has quickly become a fan-favorite. Choose between multiple brew types and strengths, including an iced coffee setting. Given what we know about Bose and the brand's reputation for unbeatable sound, the deal on this TV soundbar is worth a mention. Connectible with Bluetooth or an HDMI cable, the speaker offers a wide natural sound and spatial audio for an immersive listening experience. Stop misplacing your keys by attaching them to a Bluetooth tracker. Tile by Life360 Mate uses an app to help you locate whatever item you attach it to. The tracker can also be triggered as an SOS alert in case of emergencies. The Instant Pot Pro manages to do the work of 10 cooking appliances all in this 6-quart-capacity multi-cooker, already outfitted with five customizable settings so you can make your own recipes at the touch of a button. Home cooks can do everything from sauté to steam to sous vide and even make yogurt. The SoundLink Flex by Bose claims to offer the clearest possible sound by using a special positioning technology that allows the water-resistant speaker to sense what position it's in for optimal clarity. Its state-of-the-art design features deep, clear, and immersive audio and up to 12 hours of listening per charge.

Full Content:
The Veterans Affairs Department will reduce staff by 30,000 through retirements. This avoids large layoffs initially planned. Veterans groups and Congress worried about the impact on veteran care. The VA assures safeguards are in place to protect services. Staff reductions happened through attrition and a hiring freeze. Secretary Collins says performance is improving despite fewer employees.

Food delivery robots carrying everything from pizza to hamburgers are trying their luck on city streets and college campuses. It’s not clear if it is the future or a hilarious misstep. Visitors to Hollywood have probably seen them around, where they have been in operation since 2020, but there’s now an effort to spread usage to college towns. The Wall Street Journal wrote about how the robots are getting flipped over, stuck in snow piles and some students have been found to sit on them, or trip over them, when drinking. Companies like Coco Robotics, which makes food robots, noted they are a huge hit on social media, and kids find them cute. Tokyo also has seen a growth in food robots but, in general, has residents who are more respectful of the robots and it seems to be going a little better than U.S. college campuses. Question: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.? Caroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy YES: If you build them, they will deliver. When Uber launched the first U.S. ride-hailing app in 2009, people asked who would get in the personal car of a stranger? Uber’s market cap is now nearly $200 billion. Americans love food delivery. Where labor is scarce, streets are easy to navigate, and people are hungry, robots will thrive. College campuses are great places to innovate, expand and refine service. Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research YES: Deliveries by robots certainly have potential to work well, particularly in congested urban areas having access provided by ADA compliant streets and buildings as well as ability to enter elevators. They clearly need some form of security as they inevitably will be misused, perhaps like Tesla cars having cameras to record vandalizing and to prevent misappropriating of their operations. Flying drones may avoid some problems navigating terrestrial obstacles and potentially be less intrusive and faster. Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: There are some current problems, but the technology will undoubtedly get better in the future. Some Americans like the convenience of having their food delivered, and the food robots can do it at a lower cost than delivery services. Yes, college students may drink too much and try to abuse the robots, but that is likely to decrease as the novelty of the robots wears off and they become a more accepted part of life. David Ely, San Diego State University YES: College campuses, resorts and dense urban areas would seem to provide a suitable environment in which food delivery robots can be successful. There are many prospective customers in these markets who will appreciate the convenience and novelty of this innovation. Delivery via robot can be less expensive than alternatives that require a human. Experience will soon allow businesses to determine the distances, sidewalk conditions, regulatory constraints and weather conditions where robots can be successful. Ray Major, economist YES: But not in their current form, the current tech needs more time to mature. Think of this as a V1.0 of a generic personalized delivery service. As with many V1.0s, the concept is ahead of its time, and its implementation needs to be refined. Inventions like Apple’s Newton laid the foundation for iPhones. Segways failed, but in another form became e-bikes and set the stage for micro-mobility. Give it a few years and it might compete with Amazon. James Hamilton, UC San Diego YES: At least in some settings. In controlled environments like college campuses, hospitals and large corporate complexes delivery robots are already proving to be successful. The extent to which they can succeed in tougher urban environments is another question. They pose a new potential sidewalk hazard for the elderly and those of us with disabilities. And it’s yet another step leading people to greater social isolation with less interaction with real humans. Norm Miller, University of San Diego YES: Eventually these will be perfected and become part of normal operations, just as self-driving cars are inevitable. I’ve seen them used in Asian restaurants. I once had tenants that stole every campus machine not bolted down, and if these guys are not in jail, then the challenge for U.S. public delivery robots is that they are too easy to steal from, or abuse, and none, at present, have any defense mode like electric-shocks. Hmmm? Chris Van Gorder, Scripps Health YES: I don’t know if they will be successful in the general populations just like I’m not sure drones will be either, but in select communities like college campuses or major business campuses, they could be quite helpful and efficient. Scripps has been using food delivery robots or “TUGs” to deliver patient meals to different nursing units at Scripps La Jolla for years and it’s likely the use of these robots will be expanded in years to come. Phil Blair, Manpower YES: The U.S. will become early adopters of any technology that improves service and saves money. Jamie Moraga, Franklin Revere NO: Like the Bird and Lime e-scooters, these “cute” food delivery robots are likely to face significant challenges. While the intention is good and the concept promising, the reality is that these robots will be vandalized, damaged, robbed or intentionally destroyed. Additionally, they could pose liability issues and dangers to walkways and roadways, not to mention the threat of overregulation by local municipalities. The U.S. still has a way to go before food delivery robots can be successful. Gary London, London Moeder Advisors YES: I’ve seen them in Westwood (Los Angeles) and New York City. Early autos were probably targeted by horse and carriage people. Once the novelty wears off and delivery robots become ubiquitous, I’m sure they will just blend into the urban fabric. Change is hard, but the combination of densification in the cities, labor costs and technological advances makes them inevitable. We will eventually see a coupling of autonomous vehicles and robotics deliver to the suburbs, as well. Bob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates YES: Food delivery robots are already gaining significant traction in the U.S., particularly in urban areas such as Los Angeles, San Jose and Dallas. Companies like Uber Eats and Serve Robotics have deployed over 2,000 delivery bots. Each of our hotels has a “service robot” for food, beverages and supplies, and customer satisfaction is high. Delivery speed and cost efficiency are improving, which is critical since uninformed politicians want to raise the minimum wage by 45%. Austin Neudecker, Weave Growth YES: Robot couriers may stumble today, but over a longer horizon, their spread feels inevitable. Early pilots will hit curbs, pranksters and regulatory roadblocks. Many will fail. Yet technology improves rapidly, labor continues to tighten, and consumers expect increased convenience. There will be a period of adaptation and acclimation for a diverse population, spanning early users to luddites. Ultimately, simple economics will prevail. Expect a messy adjustment marred by layoffs, zoning fights and skepticism. Have an idea for an Econometer question? Email me at phillip.molnar@sduniontribune.com. Follow me on Threads: @phillip020

Title: Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/chris-hedges-profiting-from-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Activism Chris Hedges, ScheerPost War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.” “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.” In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.” You can see my interview with Albanese here. The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.” The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.” “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities — centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.” Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.” The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’” Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin.” “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.” Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.” “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post-October 2023.” There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.” At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.” “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.” IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner in this current genocide. It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance. “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel,” the report notes. Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police, universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.” “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.” Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.” The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.” There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.” Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.” “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land, demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.” Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie. “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with Israel.” “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads. “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.” “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes. These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.” The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.” Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank. In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.” BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.” “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration of Gaza. ” International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds. “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads. “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic new shekel market.” The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them.” Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads. “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.” The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.” You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between the university Israeli military here. Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem. These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held accountable. Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai The SaaS sector experienced a dramatic bifurcation in the first half of 2025, with clear winners and losers emerging based on AI differentiation, security positioning, and vertical specialization. While the broader S&P 500 gained approximately 5-6% YTD, SaaS performance ranged from spectacular gains of nearly 80% to significant declines of -30% (or more). Market Drivers: The performance spread of over 95 percentage points between top performers (~80%) and worst performers (-43%) highlighted the market’s demand for innovation and differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape. How AI Led Palantir From Slow Growth (13%) to Hypergrowth (49%!) The SaaS market in 1H’25 showed clear bifurcation between companies with compelling AI differentiation (70%+ gains) and traditional enterprise software (single-digit or negative returns). Security and data infrastructure companies emerged as the biggest winners, while general productivity and communication tools lagged significantly. Bottom Line: Success in 2025 required either mission-critical positioning (security, data), clear AI differentiation (Palantir), or deep vertical specialization (Veeva, Guidewire). Generic horizontal tools and traditional enterprise software struggled to gain investor confidence despite solid operational performance. Data sources: Live stock performance data verified through multiple financial platforms as of July 2025 While we’ve focused on the SaaS bifurcation between AI winners and traditional enterprise software strugglers, there’s an important counterpoint worth highlighting: Oracle Corporation (ORCL). The 47-year-old database giant delivered a stunning +41% YTD performance, reaching $234.22 and a market cap of $658 billion. Oracle proves that legacy doesn’t have to mean left behind. 🤖 AI Infrastructure Positioning: Rather than trying to become an AI company, Oracle positioned itself as the essential infrastructure backbone for AI workloads. Their database and cloud services became indispensable for companies building AI applications. ☁️ Cloud Migration Momentum: Oracle’s aggressive cloud transformation finally gained enterprise traction, with customers migrating mission-critical workloads that competitors couldn’t easily displace. 💾 Data as the Moat: While others chased AI features, Oracle doubled down on what it does best—managing enterprise data at scale. In an AI world, data infrastructure becomes more valuable, not less. 👑 Larry’s Long-Term Vision: CEO Larry Ellison’s early AI investments and partnerships (particularly around autonomous database technology) positioned Oracle perfectly for the AI infrastructure boom. Oracle’s success demonstrates that established technology companies can thrive in the AI era—but only with the right strategy. The key isn’t trying to out-innovate AI-native companies at their own game, but rather becoming indispensable infrastructure for the AI revolution. Success Formula for Legacy Players: While Salesforce struggled with AI monetization (-19% YTD) and ServiceNow remained flat (+1% YTD), Oracle showed that with the right positioning, even database dinosaurs can soar.

Title: Lara Croft is popping up everywhere except in a new Tomb Raider game

Time Published: 2025-07-07T17:17:03Z

World of Tanks collaboration announced. Fans eager to hear more about the next Tomb Raider game are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure. Since Shadow of the Tomb Raider wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of Netflix's animated series, as well as Brawlhalla, Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight, Magic the Gathering, Fall Guys, Pinball FX, and now even World of Tanks as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here, in my opinion the best Lara. The new trailer for World of Tanks, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game. Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games. As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series. But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider games rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around the next mainline Tomb Raider game. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well". Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics has been subject to layoffs, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time. Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider. I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The OpenAI logo appears on a smartphone screen and the Microsoft logo on a laptop screen as the ... More background in Athens, Greece, on July 4, 2025. Microsoft cuts up to 9,000 more jobs as it invests in AI. (Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has already achieved remarkable gains, increasing over 2x from $235 in early 2023 to about $500 now. What factors could drive the stock to double from its current value over the next few years? The answer is found in Azure and AI – the main growth engine for Microsoft. The company’s AI strategy is yielding tangible results, with notable uptake of its AI-driven features across its product offerings. This momentum, especially in its cloud computing sector, positions Microsoft for significant future expansion as businesses progressively adopt AI solutions in their operations. On another note, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – SOUN Stock To $20? Microsoft is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures expected to rise from approximately $44 billion in 2024 to over $80 billion in 2025. This considerable investment is largely driven by the growing demands of artificial intelligence. Azure is the primary beneficiary of this investment in AI infrastructure, experiencing over 30% growth that is anticipated to persist in the near future. However, Microsoft’s integration of AI extends well beyond Azure. Hundreds of thousands of customers are already utilizing Microsoft 365 Copilot to transform their daily workflows. This represents a major transition for Microsoft, shifting from the sale of traditional software licenses to providing AI-driven productivity improvements, which command premium pricing and encourage deeper customer dependence. For instance, more than 230,000 organizations—including 90% of the Fortune 500—have already embraced Copilot Studio to create AI agents, indicating Microsoft’s successful shift from pilot projects to widespread enterprise implementation. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment serves as the company’s foremost revenue driver, producing roughly $105 billion in 2024 with impressive 20% growth. This segment is Microsoft’s fastest-growing and highest-margin area, benefiting from its unique status as both a cloud infrastructure provider and a leader in enterprise software. The incorporation of AI capabilities into Azure services further increases its value, while strong enterprise relationships ensure customer loyalty and opportunities for upselling. While Azure’s rapid growth garners significant attention, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment provides an essential foundation. This segment, which includes Microsoft 365, generated $78 billion in 2024, delivering stable, recurring income. This dependable revenue source allows Microsoft to finance investments in high-growth fields such as AI and cloud services. The 82.5 million Office 365 subscriptions, an increase of 10% year-over-year, highlight the stickiness of this business. With total annual revenues exceeding $245 billion, this stable base enables Microsoft to aggressively invest in AI and cloud infrastructure while maintaining strong profitability across its varied business portfolio. For Microsoft’s stock to double, the company must maintain its impressive growth, predominantly driven by its strategic leadership in AI and cloud computing. This growth will likely be propelled by the increasing adoption of AI across its Azure platform and the robust monetization of its AI-driven software, especially Microsoft 365 Copilot. Examining the figures, we estimate Microsoft’s revenues will surpass $405 billion within the next four years, with adjusted earnings exceeding $20 per share. Currently trading around $500, MSFT stock is valued at about 14 times its trailing revenues. Although this is slightly higher than its four-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of over 12 times, the substantial growth in Azure and Copilot may justify a premium. If Azure sustains its remarkable 30%+ growth rate, the accelerated revenue could merit even higher valuation multiples. Additionally, AI services often yield higher margins than traditional cloud infrastructure. As AI becomes a more significant contributor to Microsoft’s revenue, operational leverage could lead to considerable profit growth. If Microsoft establishes a clear lead in enterprise AI, mirroring its historical dominance in productivity software, investors might attribute a lasting premium valuation to the stock. Even a minor increase in the P/S ratio to 18 times could push the stock beyond $1,000 within the next four years. The combination of growing revenues across all segments and improved profitability stemming from AI efficiencies could substantially enhance investor confidence in Microsoft. As the company showcases its ability to monetize significant AI investments while preserving market leadership, investors may begin to apply premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology firms. This multiple expansion, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides a mathematical foundation for the stock to double. This outcome relies on both sustained revenue growth and a reevaluation of Microsoft’s long-term earnings potential within the AI economy. While Microsoft’s trajectory appears optimistic, a number of factors could impede the stock from doubling. The primary concern is the normalization of AI spending. Companies might become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current rate of AI investment may not be sustainable over the long term. Additionally, competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging competitors could also challenge Microsoft’s pricing power in the AI market and its ability to gain market share. High-interest rates could render growth stocks like Microsoft less attractive compared to fixed-income alternatives. In summary, investors considering a position in Microsoft should also account for these risks. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income ... More generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been regarded as a treasure trove of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. The Oracle of Omaha's investment philosophy centers on identifying companies with durable competitive advantages, strong management teams, and the ability to generate consistent cash flows over the long term. These characteristics naturally lend themselves to reliable dividend payments, making Berkshire's holdings an excellent starting point for income-focused investors. In this analysis, we'll examine five standout dividend stocks from Berkshire Hathaway's current portfolio that offer compelling income opportunities. Selection methodology focused on companies with sustainable dividend yields, strong financial fundamentals and proven track records of returning capital to shareholders. I evaluated each holding based on dividend sustainability, business quality and overall investment merit in order to identify the most attractive income-generating opportunities within Buffett's carefully curated portfolio. Chevron Corporation stands as one of the most reliable dividend payers in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors a compelling 4.78% dividend yield backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the energy sector. As an integrated oil and gas company, Chevron operates across the entire energy value chain, from exploration and production to refining and marketing. This diversification provides multiple revenue streams and helps stabilize cash flows even during volatile commodity price cycles. The company's recent performance reflects the strength of its operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation strategy. Trading at around $143 per share as of June 30, 2025, Chevron has demonstrated remarkable resilience in navigating the complex energy landscape. The company's forward dividend of $6.84 per share represents a substantial commitment to returning capital to shareholders, supported by robust free cash flow generation from its high-quality asset base. Chevron's position as a top dividend pick stems from its conservative financial management and focus on maintaining dividend payments through various market cycles. The company has consistently prioritized shareholder returns while investing in lower-carbon energy solutions and maintaining operational efficiency. With its strong credit profile and diversified operations spanning multiple geographic regions, Chevron offers income investors both attractive current yield and the potential for dividend growth as energy markets evolve. Warren Buffett's significant investment in Chevron reflects his confidence in the company's long-term prospects and management team's ability to generate sustainable returns. The energy giant's commitment to maintaining its dividend even during challenging periods makes it an attractive option for investors seeking reliable income from the energy sector. Apple represents one of Berkshire Hathaway's most significant holdings and showcases how even technology companies can become reliable dividend payers when they achieve sufficient scale and maturity. While the company's 0.51% dividend yield may appear modest compared to traditional income stocks, Apple's dividend story is compelling when viewed through the lens of total shareholder returns and the company's massive capital return program. Trading at around $200 per share, Apple has a forward dividend of $1 per share, which may seem small in absolute terms. Still, it's backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate America and unprecedented cash generation capabilities. Apple's services business, in particular, provides recurring revenue streams that support dividend sustainability. The company's dividend policy reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation, combining regular dividend payments with substantial share repurchase programs. This strategy has proven highly effective in returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued innovation and strategic investments. Apple's dividend has grown consistently since its reinstatement in 2012, demonstrating management's commitment to rewarding long-term shareholders. What makes Apple particularly attractive as a dividend stock within Berkshire's portfolio is the company's ability to generate enormous free cash flows from its integrated hardware, software, and services ecosystem. The recurring nature of services revenue, combined with the loyalty of Apple's customer base, provides a stable foundation for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple reflects his recognition of the company's transformation from a pure technology play into a mature, cash-generating enterprise capable of supporting reliable dividend payments. The Coca-Cola Company represents the quintessential Berkshire Hathaway dividend stock, embodying Warren Buffett's investment philosophy of owning businesses with enduring competitive advantages and predictable cash flows. With a dividend yield of 2.88% and trading around $70 per share, Coca-Cola continues to demonstrate why it has been one of Buffett's longest-held and most successful investments, spanning over three decades in the Berkshire portfolio. As the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola operates one of the most recognizable and valuable brand portfolios in the consumer goods industry. The company's global reach extends to virtually every country, providing geographic diversification and multiple growth opportunities across developed and emerging markets. Coca-Cola's forward dividend of $2 per share represents a substantial commitment to shareholders, supported by the company's consistent cash flow generation and strong market positions. The beverage giant has increased its dividend for 62 consecutive years, earning it recognition as a Dividend King and making it one of the most reliable dividend payers in the consumer staples sector. This remarkable track record demonstrates management's unwavering commitment to returning capital to shareholders through various economic cycles. The company's dividend sustainability is rooted in its asset-light business model, substantial brand equity, and extensive global distribution network. Coca-Cola's focus on higher-margin concentrate sales, combined with strategic partnerships with bottling companies worldwide, generates predictable cash flows that support consistent dividend payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in Coca-Cola reflects his appreciation for businesses with pricing power, brand strength, and the ability to compound shareholder wealth over decades through reliable dividend growth. American Express Company stands out as a unique financial services provider within Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors exposure to both the payments industry and premium consumer spending trends. With a dividend yield of 1.03% and trading at $319 per share, American Express has delivered a solid performance, reflecting the strength of its business model and the successful execution of its growth strategy. The company operates as both a payment network and a card issuer, creating a closed-loop system that generates revenue from multiple sources, including discount fees, interest income, and annual fees. This integrated model enables American Express to exert greater control over the customer experience and generate various revenue streams that support the sustainability of its dividend. The company's focus on affluent customers and premium card products has proven remarkably resilient, as these segments tend to maintain spending levels even during economic uncertainties. American Express's forward dividend of $3.28 per share demonstrates the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued growth investments. The company has consistently increased its dividend over the years, reflecting strong credit performance, disciplined risk management, and successful expansion into new markets and customer segments. The financial services giant's ability to generate substantial returns on equity supports its dividend policy and provides confidence in the sustainability of future payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in American Express dates back several decades, reflecting his appreciation for the company's strong brand, loyal customer base, and ability to generate attractive returns on invested capital. The company's focus on premium customers, combined with its integrated business model and global expansion opportunities, positions it well for continued dividend growth. American Express's strong capital position and conservative approach to credit risk management make it an attractive dividend stock for investors seeking exposure to the financial services sector. Citigroup rounds out our list of top Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks, offering investors a 2.63% dividend yield and representing Warren Buffett's confidence in the banking sector's long-term prospects. Trading at around $85 per share, Citigroup has been undergoing a comprehensive transformation under its current management, focusing on simplifying its business model and enhancing operational efficiency. As one of the largest global banks, Citigroup operates across multiple business lines, including consumer banking, institutional clients, and global markets. The bank's international presence provides geographic diversification and exposure to the growth of emerging markets, while its institutional banking franchise serves multinational corporations and financial institutions worldwide. This diversified business model helps stabilize earnings and supports dividend sustainability through various economic cycles. Citigroup's forward dividend of $2.24 per share reflects management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels to meet regulatory requirements and support business growth. The bank has been working to improve its operational efficiency and risk management capabilities, which should support more consistent earnings and dividend payments over time. Recent regulatory improvements and strategic focus on core businesses position the bank for enhanced profitability and shareholder returns. The bank's dividend policy strikes a balance between maintaining strong capital ratios and meeting shareholder return expectations, reflecting the regulatory environment in which large banks operate. Citigroup's substantial book value and improving operational metrics provide a foundation for dividend sustainability, while its global franchise and diversified revenue streams offer potential for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's investment in Citigroup demonstrates his confidence in the banking sector's ability to generate attractive returns and support reliable dividend payments for long-term investors. Bottom Line These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. From Chevron's energy sector leadership and attractive 4.78% yield to Apple's technology-driven cash generation capabilities, each stock offers unique advantages for income-focused investors. Coca-Cola's 62-year dividend growth streak exemplifies the type of consistent wealth-building opportunities that Warren Buffett seeks. Meanwhile, American Express and Citigroup offer exposure to financial services through their respective dividend yields of 1.03% and 2.63%. Together, these holdings demonstrate how Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio construction philosophy naturally leads to high-quality dividend-paying investments that can form the foundation of a robust income strategy.

Title: The stock market's biggest bet is setting investors up for a smackdown

Wall Street really needs AI to live up to the hype. A lot has been said about the emerging technology's world-changing potential: Its ability to create stunningly realistic images and videos, ace the LSAT and the MCAT, and complete rote research tasks. You could argue it's ready to augment — or even replace — entry-level jobs. These features have investors up and down the Street very excited. Staunch supporters like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives say AI could revolutionize the human experience. Research desks from big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have given subtler nods to the prospect of AI as a productivity and profit booster, which could provide an undercurrent to stock market success over the next several years. In fact, analysts are counting on the AI mania to fuel the market even as the White House's chaotic trade policy eats into corporate America's profit potential. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to grow 8% this year, a fairly average showing for an anything-but-average year. What is notable is just how much of that growth relies on the tech sector: Silicon Valley companies are expected to boost their earnings by 21% — the highest growth of any sector. By contrast, profits for retailers are forecast to grow a measly 2.5%. Within the tech sector, semiconductor companies — one of the most globally exposed industries on the stock market — are expected to supercharge profit this year, with a projected climb of 49%. This enthusiasm is a signal Wall Street is betting that demand for AI's use cases will supersede tariff turmoil or job market wobbles. AI's growth has been incredible, and its adoption has been strong enough to leave its fingerprints on economic data sets like business investment and manufacturing spending. Yet no matter how rabid the world is about AI's possibilities, the amount that investors are relying on the tech to fuel the market's gains — especially in the face of rising economic uncertainty — feels short-sighted. Tech stocks helped the market recover from its April malaise, yet earnings expectations and economic momentum are even weaker than they were at the lowest point of the sell-off. This combination leaves the stock market in a precarious spot: Either AI needs to live up to the hype, or investors could be looking at a gnarly second half of the year. One way to tell the story of human history is through our technology — the lightbulb, the calculator, the tractor, the computer all stand as markers to our societal progress and have helped drive the level of efficiency and productivity we enjoy. Tech has perhaps played an equally prominent role in our investment portfolios. The Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are collectively worth $18 trillion, or about 33% of the S&P 500's total market value. Together, their stock prices have increased 330% over the past five years, compared with a 100% rise in the S&P 500. It makes sense. Big Tech's products have become deeply integrated into our daily lives, and that level of ubiquity has also captured Wall Street's attention. Venture capital fundraising reached a record in the first quarter amid a huge appetite for AI investment, and S&P 500 companies mentioned AI more than tariffs on second-quarter conference calls. The $65 trillion US stock market may be particularly gripped by Big Tech's ups and downs these days, but it hasn't always been this way. Tech has averaged about 20% of the S&P 500's market value over the past decade, including 13% in the five years before COVID. The dominance is not set in stone, and while the wider market's fortunes are tied to tech now, that may not always be the case. While the stock market may seem like one big proxy for the tech sector's explosive growth right now, there is one deeper connection that should draw investors' attention. Over time, the S&P 500 has been attached at the hip to the fate of the broader US economy. Eight of the past 12 market crashes — S&P drops of 20% or more — overlapped with recessions. No matter how high-flying an industry is, recessions tend to pull stock prices and business hopes back to Earth. The internet revolutionized the world in the late 1990s, and the explosion in social media dominated the 2010s, but the information sector has shed employees and seen share prices fall in the past three recessions. Given that setup, we've set the stage for a portfolio smackdown of the ages. Economists are worried a recession is coming, yet investors are surprisingly upbeat about AI's prospects — so upbeat that they've bid S&P 500 tech stocks to nearly a record high. Sell-side analysts who evaluate company-level trends are similarly optimistic. But in the real economy, layoffs are growing, and hiring has ground to a halt. The sharply diverging views between economists and stock analysts mean someone has to be wrong. The freight train that is AI adoption — a three-year story of rapid innovation and progress — could collide with a massive wall from historic tariffs, high interest rates, and low consumer confidence. What's particularly rich about this is that tech companies are the most exposed sector to global tariffs. They gather the highest percentage of revenue internationally, plus they have the most suppliers and factories outside US borders. In fact, semiconductor companies — the firms providing chips for AI technology — are expected to hit that aforementioned 49% earnings growth despite generating 67% of their revenue abroad and sourcing 70% of their supplies from overseas. Some analysts believe that if AI hopes can keep the stock market chugging along, maybe it can do the same to the economy. After all, companies invested an inflation-adjusted $2.2 trillion on computers and other processing equipment last quarter, about one-seventh of the $16 trillion Americans spent on goods and services. Investing more in AI does ultimately help boost the economy, but that $2 trillion is peanuts compared with the real engine of the US economy. Americans' spending accounts for about 70% of GDP — by far the biggest driver of output — and spending has dropped in each of the past nine recessions. If tariffs intimidate consumers and lead to layoffs that decimate American incomes, then the economy is probably bound for a crisis — whether the robots pan out or not. And based on history, an economic crisis could topple the stock market. The math shows us that AI isn't much of a match for some effects of tariffs and may not logistically be enough to save the economy from ruin. Your portfolio's outcome may be a different story, though. This is when I have to introduce you to one of the most frustrating adages of investing: The stock market is not the economy. The economy is the value that we create — the hard assets, the cash spent, the paychecks we get. Stocks are an expression of that value, but they use the present reality to project future expectations. AI's impact on the economy may not bear out through numbers. But in your portfolio, AI's influence depends on how willing we are to collectively dream up better days ahead in terms of what AI is capable of and how much money AI-dominant firms will amass in the years to come. Dreaming is already a big part of the AI trade. S&P 500 tech companies' estimated earnings grew about 50% in 2023 and 2024, yet their share prices jumped 112%. Nothing is cut-and-dried when it comes to the stock market. It is the ultimate tangled web of logic, psychology, and mixed incentives. The stock market's future depends on investors' ability to dream, and people are willing to dream when they feel confident in the present moment. The problem is, investors are awfully confident about tech stocks right now. S&P 500 tech companies made up about 23% of total index profits in the first quarter, yet their shares account for 32% of the S&P 500's value. To close that gap, tech profits would have to grow 40%, or tech stocks would have to drop 29% from their end-of-June levels. Stocks can thrive when expectations are higher than reality, but in these conditions, they require reasons to stay hopeful. The problem arises when investors aren't willing to dream. When they're too focused on present issues to give compelling stories the benefit of the doubt. Or in big market drops, crushed by financial strain. Then, the numbers matter. People claw for any concrete evidence of AI's value. They demand proof of profits, even though companies are spending money on a pivot to the next big thing. Stock prices adjust, and if you hold a swath of US stocks or index funds, your money is probably heavily exposed to this reality check. This is what happened in 2000. Investors were willing to dream about this brave new technology called the World Wide Web until interest rates climbed too high and the reality of how much computing was needed for Y2K was found to be way overblown. Suddenly, the dream died, and tech stock prices came back down to reality. These days, we all know that dream wasn't completely off base. Yet share prices took an 80% crash before the promise of the new tech came to fruition. This is what I worry about the most in the clash between AI and the economy. We're somewhere between AI saving the world and being an overhyped bust of a technology that can be ripped off by another country. I'm not foolish enough to call this a bubble, and I think AI will eventually deliver benefits for our economy. We're not there yet, though, even though investors like to think so. It takes years for big technological trends to take hold, and productivity usually shines through when workers feel empowered and companies feel comfortable expanding. That's far from the case right now — business confidence is in the dumps, so we're in the opposite scenario. When the economy is getting weaker, it's best to grasp onto what's real in your portfolio. And there's a striking gap between AI and reality.

Title: Kiwi crime-fighting software firm Auror gets big tick from UK Govt, medtech Formus Labs nears commercial launch in the US - Tech Insider

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is urging more retailers to adopt Auror's crime reporting and intel-sharing platform. Image / Getty Creative The Labour Government in the UK has a Kiwi software firm at the heart of its retail crime crackdown. Auckland medtech startup Formus Labs is about to crack the US market open - and be big in Japan. A conference hears that medtech is becoming a multibillion-dollar earner for NZ. One of our fastest-growing software firms just got a major profile boost in the United Kingdom, where it’s positioned to play a role in retail crime crackdown. Over the weekend, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper - whose portfolios includes policing - said shoplifters are to be barred from stores and prosecuted under plans for the first national database of repeat offenders. And it looks like a crime-reporting software platform made by Auckland-based Auror will play a key role in keeping the new database up-to-date. Cooper said she wanted more UK retailers to use Auror’s software, which aims to make it easier for retailers to report offences to police, including photos, and snippets of video taken on their cameras. The Home Secretary is urging police to make greater use of facial recognition technology and is behind the bill, currently winding its way through the UK Parliament. The controversial bill makes it an offence to conceal your identity from CCTV under certain circumstances (including protests), introduces the new offence of assaulting a retail worker and makes theft from a shop trial-able, regardless of the value of the goods (from a £200 [$450] threshold today). Stores including M&S, Morrisons, Boots, Tesco, Primark, and Greggs are submitting CCTV, photos and personal data on all their repeat shoplifters to Auror’s platform, which is shared with police. Cooper endorsed the Kiwi software after receiving a briefing from Boots, according to the UK’s Telegraph. Additionally, two Auror executives were recently invited to 10 Downing Street: UK and Europe vice president Mark Gleeson (a former tactical commander with the Royal Air Force) and UK director of law enforcement and partnerships Paul Fagg (who began his career as a police constable for London’s Metro Police and rose to become a police inspector with the National Business Crime Centre before joining Auror last year). Fagg said his firm’s crime intelligence platform enabled retailers to record everything that happens in their stores to tackle the “huge under-reporting issue”. “Police have access to Auror so that incidents they did not see before are now visible for them,” he said, adding that this enabled police and retailers to identify prolific offenders with CCTV and photographic evidence. The shared data enables all the stores and police to “join the dots” to identify prolific offenders, gather evidence for prosecutions and provide security staff on the shop doors with photo watchlists to bar entry, Fagg said. Auror says its system is used by 98% of retailers in NZ and 75% in Australia. In November last year, the Kiwi firm raised $82m at a $500m valuation, with the funds earmarked, in part, for a push to further expand in the US. The raise was led by two new investors: Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, a venture fund backed by five retailers including Tesco and Woolworths. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$70 billion ($115b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. On June 4, Axon and Auror announced a new Retail Crime Hub, which they billed as “unlocking a more efficient way for North American law enforcement agencies to collaborate with retailers and stop crime in our communities”. Auror already had a substantial beachhead in the US through anchor customer Walmart, founder Phil Thomson said. The new Retail Crime Hub should help it extend its reach. Thomson said a key issue was that while NZ has a single law enforcement authority (the police) dealing with retail crime, in the US it varied not just by state but by locality with some 18,000 agencies at the country level. Auror is pitched as a conduit to link them together for intel on retail crimes that fly well under the radar of national enforcement agencies. The fast-growing Auror has drawn a degree of privacy flak on both sides of the Tasman with a system that uses digital images which can misidentify people. But the firm has kept its nose clean with our Privacy Commissioner. Thomson emphasises that Auror doesn’t operate any security cameras and does not offer live facial recognition. Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster recently gave facial recognition trials by our two major supermarket chains his cautious tick of approval. And Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says the option of having a centralised system of facial recognition is something he expects officials to consider. “We [Auror] acknowledge the calls from groups like Retail NZ, the UK Home Secretary, and NZ Government, for the use of technology such as facial recognition technology [FRT] in the retail sector,” Thomson told Tech Insider earlier today. “We support the responsible use of FRT by retailers to protect workers, shoppers and communities from violence and harm.” Thomson knows the legal and philosophical ins-and-outs (he’s a former intellectual property lawyer with Simpson Grierson and an ex-board member of the public-interest focused NZ Council of Legal Education). But he says his support for FRT is based on what’s happening every day in the real world. “With retail violence continuing to rise, it’s a no-brainer for retailers to explore how this technology [FRT] can be responsibly used in their stores. It’s already used in everyday environments such as airports, hotels and casinos,” he says. “Due to the increase in violence and crime in stores, in my view, it’s now not a matter of ‘if’ or ‘when’ - it’s about ‘how’ this can be deployed in the best way possible, protecting communities while also protecting privacy. “Retail crime isn’t victimless - it’s violence, it’s assault, and it’s organised. We know one in 10 events involve violence or use of a weapon. Ten % of top repeat offenders are responsible for more than 60% of the crime in Kiwi stores. Furthermore, repeat offenders are up to four times more likely to be violent.” Auckland-based med-tech Formus Labs will commercially launch in the key US market in a couple of months, founder and chief executive Dr Ju Zhang says. The launch follows the start-up gaining US Food and Drug Administration approval in December for its AI-powered, 3D software for planning orthopaedic surgeries - specifically hip replacements, with its FDA green light. Formus is lining up deals with the likes of hospital chains and insurance firms. Zhang says his firm has pilots already under way with several “tier one” and “tier two” players - with revenue above US$1 billion ($1.65b) or in the hundreds of millions, respectively. The start-up already has a close relationship with one of the biggest names in the field - Indiana-based Zimmer Biomet, with whom it’s partnered with in Australia since 2019. Zhang says with major commercial revenue just months away, there are no plans for another sizeable raise, though it’s possible Formus will stage a small round for bridging. (Its last major raise was US$5m ($8.25m) in early in a round led by Global From Day 1 and supported by Icehouse Ventures, Pacific Channel, Flying Kiwis and Punakaiki Fund). The FDA approval was a breakthrough moment as many regulators around the world take their lead from the US agency, Zhang says. Japan - a major market for orthopaedic technology - will be next cab-off-the-rank for the multi-Hi-Tech Awards winner. Australia is also a major market. Zhang says Formus consults closely with several orthopaedic surgeons in NZ but commercial maths means the primary focus has been across the Tasman and in North America. Regardless, he and his crew of 16 staff are based in Auckland, which he anticipated will remain the hub of the firm’s R&D. There’s a lot that’s high-tech about joint replacement surgery these days. But there’s also a lot of drilling, scraping, sawing and hammering. “In some ways, it’s a lot like carpentry,” Zhang says. Formus Lab’s software helps a surgeon more quickly and accurately prepare, and pick the right size joint replacement from what can run into hundreds of options. Currently one in 10 operations have to be redone and one in five have some degree of post-op complication. At a HealthTech Week event in Auckland last week, the audience heard that New Zealand’s MedTech sector currently generates around $2.6b in annual revenue and is projected to reach $3.8b by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% since 2018, according to Technology Investment Network, TIN200 stats. “It’s still dominated by the big fish; the likes of F&P Healthcare,” Callaghan Innovation HealthTech head Andrew Clews told Tech Insider. “But there is a second tier of companies coming through now that we’re supporting.” Clews says venture capital money is coming on board and the number of start-ups is increasing - thanks in part to a tight-knit ecosystem. Formus Labs is one of several medtechs spun out of Auckland University’s Bioengineering Institute, for example, he said. Others include Kitea Health, the maker of a world-first wireless implant for measuring brain pressure, Toku Eyes and Alimetry. The event was arranged by Te Tītoki Mataora, funded by Auckland University and MBIE and Callaghan Innovation’s HealthTech Activator. Both programmes offer various forms of support for medtech start-ups, although Callaghan Innovation is being disestablished. With most staff already laid off, the HealthTech Activator has funding to last through until a new advanced research agency is created around this time next year. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer.

Title: After a Year of High-stakes Financing, Saks Turns Back to High-stakes Retailing

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The luxury department store has access to the funds it needs to operate now; the question is how well it will square up to a tough retail market. Deputy Managing Editor The year since Saks and Neiman Marcus Group cut their landmark $2.7 billion deal has been dominated not by talk of a new luxury retail giant or a modern merchant force taking shape. Instead, it’s been all about the rough and tumble of high-stakes corporate finance. On that score, it’s been a story of quick and agile dealmaking that would be surprising or just unbelievable from almost anyone else but Richard Baker, executive chairman of what is now Saks Global. Related Articles Financial S&P Cuts Saks Global's Credit Rating to CC Fashion Features From Sex Clubs to Castles, Latex to Upcycling, Berlin Fashion Week Had Something for Everyone Consider this: You May Also Like And then things really got started. Hudson’s Bay was spun off and went bankrupt, Saks and Neiman’s vendors were thrown into a tailspin by a yearlong schedule to repay past due bills and 90-day payment terms on all shipments going forward. And bondholders — some of whom seem to haven’t bothered to read some very important fine print — revolted when they learned their debt wasn’t directly secured by the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship. Saks then lined up $350 million in new financing in May only to ditch that in favor of $600 million in financing last month from a group of bondholders jockeying for a better position in the capital structure. From the outside, the company has appeared to be lurching from one crisis to the next. And from the inside, it’s seemingly been a nightmare. But last week, new money in hand, Saks made a crucial $120 million interest payment on the bonds. It’s said to be paying vendors on time under the new terms and Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, has even floated the possibility of making back payments earlier than planned. “As we progress over the next few months, if we see a return to what we believe to be normalized receipt flow, we plan to evaluate the possibility of accelerating the timeline to pay back past due balances to our brand partners,” Metrick told vendors in a memo last month that was obtained by WWD. At least for now, the Saks story is no longer a tale about financing. Everyone inside and out agrees that Saks has the money to get through this year and sources close to the company maintain that it has the financial wherewithal to last much longer even if Christmas doesn’t turn out to be a blockbuster season. One source said Saks’ outside auditors gave the company a clean bill of health — good for at least a year — after the $350 million in financing was lined up and now that’s been upsized to a potential total of $600 million, giving it even more cushion. Right now, the future of Saks is not about its ability to wrangle investors or lenders, but the company’s retail savvy and its ability to push what Metrick has called a “reset” of luxury retail through an increasingly complicated retail market. “All we heard about is ‘We’re running out of money,'” said Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, summing up the bondholder take on the company. “’We need money for inventory, we need money to make interest payments.’ Money, money, money. So OK, we got you set up, you told us you needed this much money, now you show us that you know what to buy and you bought the right inventory and you know how to sell it to make a reasonable profit.” That’s the trick in retail anyway — and one that requires finesse in good times and real skill in tough ones, like now when consumers are skittish and President Donald Trump’s trade war is still disrupting supply. Big retail mergers are dicey to start with. “Now, they have control of the best high-end retailers,” Hynes said. “In theory it should work out. Nobody’s going to open a new high-end retailer tomorrow. It’s just not going to happen. So they got the market cornered. In theory, if anything’s going to work, this should work. Everybody says, ‘Rich people always have money, this should work out.’ However, if you look at history, combining retailers has never worked out.” That point could be argued, kind of — the Federated-May mega merger worked for a time and changed the retail landscape, but that company, now Macy’s Inc., is now morphing again for a new age. But nobody argues that Saks is working in a tough space. “Department stores are not the best neighborhood to be operating in,” said Mickey Chadha, the Moody’s Investors Service debt analyst who follows Saks. “They’re relying on cost cuts, layoffs, efficiencies between the two companies,” Chadha said. “And that’s all great. If you can accomplish that, you’re definitely better for your bottom line. However, you have to grow, you have to grow. And their sales have been declining quite dramatically in the last couple of years. So if you don’t grow, there’s only so much you can do in synergies and cost cuts. “This $600 million of new monies that we’re talking about is great,” he said. “It gives them more runway to get the ship back on course. But it’s not going to be the end all. If they continue to burn cash, that $600 million will then disappear again in the next 12 months, and then they’ll need more capital. The holiday is going to be key for them.” Holiday, next year and beyond relies not on raising more money or courting investors, but on making the big Saks reset work. It’s a complicated bit of work for Metrick. Saks Global is combining operations for the two nameplates, reestablishing trust with vendors, cementing the new payment terms, expanding through a luxury shop on Amazon and looking at brands in new ways with its Authentic Luxury Group joint venture. Somewhere in there could be a bright future for the idea of the luxury department store, which has suffered blow after blow since the bankruptcy of Barneys New York in 2019. There is no shortage of brands with real gripes against Saks as it just now starts paying bills due years ago. But some luxury labels are also sensing new potential ahead — and brands both large and small say Saks Global is vital to their businesses and its survival is key. One adviser to independent designer brands said they are getting more excited about Saks’ shop on Amazon, which launched with 50 brands and is said to be bringing new shoppers into the business. “Are we going to actually see more sales through e-commerce than we’re seeing in the physical stores?” the adviser wondered. “How does the retail footprint shrink or change?” That refocuses the narrative around Saks back to where it really should be — its retail fortunes.
