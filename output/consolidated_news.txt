The company’s expansion machine is in overdrive, and billions are backing it. Tether is making moves on multiple fronts. From backing a major investment round in an Italian AI robotics startup to securing recognition in Abu Dhabi, the company is going well beyond its stablecoin roots. This isn’t a new move. AMBCrypto previously reported that in November, Tether negotiated a €1 billion investment in Germany’s Neura Robotics while deploying $1.5 billion in commodity-backed lending. The company has taken a step into the AI sector, joining an €70 million ($81 million) funding round for Generative Bionics. They’re an Italian startup building next-generation humanoid robots for industrial environments. Source: Tether The round was led by CDP Venture Capital’s AI fund. Tether, as one of its key private backers, supports the development of robots built for heavy-duty performance and natural human interaction. The company says its investment will help the startup scale production, validate its humanoid platform, and integrate into Europe’s fast-growing robotics ecosystem. It fits neatly into Tether’s broader strategy. Their announcement elaborated on the investment, noting, “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development.” Tether also saw a major win in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM, where USDT is now formally recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token across several additional blockchains, including Aptos, Cosmos, Near, Polkadot, and TON. Source: X The decision gives licensed firms in the free zone broader flexibility to use USDT within regulated activities. This expands on earlier approvals limited to Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. In the official statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said, “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership.” Tether also carried out a major mint on the TRON network — a fresh $1 billion USDT. Arkham Intelligence reported the tokens moving from the protocol’s “black hole” address to Tether’s multisig wallet, a standard process the company uses to replenish liquidity for exchanges and institutional customers. Source: Arkham Intelligence Tether has not tied this issuance to any specific deployment. But, large mints typically mean preparations for market demand, new integrations, or upcoming distribution. With billion dollar bets and a foot in multiple grounds, Tether’s influence now far exceeds stablecoins and crypto. It’s not too left field to assume that bigger and better things are yet to come.

Title: Wall Street is Still Pounding the Table Over Nvidia, Micron, and Netflix

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © pestoverde / Flickr Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is pushing higher on a report from Truth Social that the tech giant could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and other high-demand areas. All under the condition that a quarter of sales be paid to the U.S. government. As a result, analysts at Bernstein just initiated an outperform rating on NVDA, noting that if reports are accurate, NVDA can ship chips to some customers in China, which is a positive development. Just yesterday, analysts at Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia, citing a significant opportunity with data centers. After all, artificial intelligence will continue to create massive demand for data centers. Right now, according to MIT Technology Review, there are about 3,000 data centers across the U.S. Plus, according to a report from McKinsey, $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure investments will be needed by 2030. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are down about $2.62 at the moment. However, Deutsche Bank analysts see more upside heading into earnings. The firm reiterated its buy rating on MU ahead of the company’s earnings on December 17, with a price target of $280, up from $200. The firm believes MU is well-positioned to benefit from the memory cycle, with HBM driving structural changes in the semiconductor industry. And down, but not out, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are being viewed positively by analysts at Needham. The firm has a buy rating on NFLX and doesn’t believe it needs Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the firm, “NFLX buying WBD would put $83B of additional value at risk of being disrupted by GenAI. Without WBD, NFLX is more global, more nimble, more tech-first, and has more flexibility with the Hollywood unions (called Guilds),” as quoted by CNBC. Just the other day, Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on NFLX. The firm noted, “We acknowledge that NFLX shares have been largely reactive to recent developments re: potential strategic outcomes. But we believe Netflix’s long-term fundamental outlook is increasingly strengthening, thanks to its highly compelling value proposition, its excellent execution track record, and its improved global, competitive positioning,” as quoted by CNBC.

Under the deal, there is a commitment of ₹2,000 crore (around $$225 million) and a greenshoe option to invest another ₹1,000 crore (around $110 million). This deal marks one of the largest primary commitments for a minority stake in a renewables platform in India, said ABREN, a Grasim subsidiary. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of around ₹14,600 crore for ABREN, it added. ABREN has achieved robust organic growth, building a diversified pan-India renewable energy portfolio of around 4.3 gogawatt (GW) across 10 states. This portfolio delivers solar, hybrid, floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power, reinforcing ABREN’s formidable position in sustainable energy. Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group, said, “India stands at the cusp of an energy transformation, arguably one of the largest anywhere in the world. The scale of the renewables opportunity in India is extraordinary, driven both by the urgent imperative of decarbonisation, and the sheer arithmetic of demand. This business sits squarely at the intersection of national energy security and climate leadership, two defining priorities for the coming decades. GIP’s investment marks a pivotal moment in our growth journey, laying a strong foundation for an accelerated buildout of our renewables platform, as we target a capacity of 10 GW+ in the coming years. Their global leadership in owning and operating some of the most sophisticated energy assets worldwide brings both rigour and reach to our ambition.” The transaction is subject to receipt of necessary statutory and regulatory approvals and completion of other conditions precedent. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial advisor to ABREN on this transaction. Raj Rao, GIP President and Chief Operating Officer, said, “We are excited to partner with Aditya Birla Group, one of India’s leading conglomerates, as today’s announcement will allow us to continue to support innovation at scale. GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective. Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India.” Published on December 9, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Bitcoin vs. XRP: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet Right Now?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Choosing between two top-tier dominant forces in any particular sector can be a difficult task. In the world of crypto, investors looking to put long-term capital to work in tokens they view as long-term stores of value outside the monetary system do have a few choices to choose from. Of course, there’s the first (and still the largest) cryptocurrency out there which is most often viewed as such a monetary system hedge – Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Bitcoin’s historical performance, its sheer size at a market capitalization of more than $1.8 trillion, and its ardent investor base makes this top token one investors have to consider up front. That said, there are other base layer networks such as XRP (CRYPTO:XRP) which are quickly becoming their own unique asset classes investors want to own. Plenty of XRP investors, who have held through Ripple’s long and arduous legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), may now view this token as truly battle-tested. XRP’s network, at least in terms of transaction activity, is a dominant force in the crypto landscape. So, which top-tier digital asset is the better long-term bet right now? Let’s dive in. There’s really not much that needs to be said about Bitcoin. It’s the biggest, largely considered to be the most stable, well-known, and liquid cryptocurrency out there. For traders, speculators and long-term investors alike, Bitcoin is often the only choice when it comes to playing momentum-driven moves in this space. And notably, the early introduction of spot ETFs and other exchange traded products which offered traditional investors an avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin has propelled massive amounts of investor capital into this network. Now, given Bitcoin’s size at a market capitalization that’s nearing $2 trillion, absolute floods of capital are going to need to continuously pour into this ecosystem in order for investors today to see upside. Indeed, a 10x from here would require Bitcoin to achieve a market capitalization of roughly $18 trillion, which would make this digital asset (which doesn’t generate cash flows and can’t be seen or held) worth more than any other entire stock market index of any country outside the United States (China currently has the second-largest equity market capitalization of around $12 trillion). That’s an incredible statistic. Of course, Bitcoin’s dominant position in terms of network value, liquidity, usage and as a perceived store of value will remain. This is among the most integral pieces of infrastructure in this sector, with a n important role for corporate treasuries and the balance sheets of financial institutions. As such, there are now many vested interests in seeing Bitcoin’s price continue to rise. Over the long-term, most investors would say Bitcoin will be the more stable bet. But will it outperform XRP? XRP visual XRP is certainly a more compelling opportunity for investors looking more for outright growth right now. As far as a utility-focused network is concerned, XRP’s key XRP Ledger technology, which allows individuals, companies and large financial entities to transfer vast amounts of capital around the world at lightning fast speeds and ultra-low costs (compared to other networks such as SWIFT which can take days to close, and take percentage points off each transaction), is very valuable. In the world of cross-border finance, XRP is clearly a long-term winner. I’m bullish on this area of the crypto market myself, and I think that this is ultimately what Bitcoin’s founders intended (at least in part) when creating the Bitcoin network to begin with. To a certain extent, XRP has capitalized on this initial mission, and perhaps done a better job than Bitcoin of creating the sort of integrated rails many coming out of the GFC hoped would exist. Being able to transfer money outsize of the system, while retaining key remittance data that ensures one will reliably receive these funds same-day, can provide immense value to an immeasurable number of counterparties. 24/7 Wall St. In my view, Bitcoin’s bull case is more conducive to long-term investors who may be more concerned around capital preservation over long periods of time. Indeed, the reality for the digital assets sector is that there are a number of high-profile blowups which have effectively pulled the rug out from underneath some pretty savvy investors. There are simply plenty of investors out there who won’t want to fall prey to such a situation, and given Bitcoin’s aforementioned status as a key treasury holding on many balance sheets within the U.S. economy (and even the U.S. government), there’s a broad vested interest in seeing this token continue to appreciate over time. Despite XRP’s enhanced utility and status as a key network to “get things done,” that’s the way things stand right now in my view. As such, and being an investor who is inherently more conservative than many out there, I’m going to stick with Bitcoin as my top crypto pick for right now. Of course, every investor’s risk tolerance preferences and investing style will differ. There are plenty of investors out there would would pick XRP over Bitcoin any day of the week (and by way of each network’s sheer size, it’s mathematically easier for XRP to 10x in value from here). But for those looking to steer clear of as much unnecessary volatility as possible, while generating market-beating returns over time, Bitcoin still stands as my preferential pick (particularly during selloffs).

Title: Aviva Seeks Partner for New City of London Skyscraper Project

Aviva Plc has kicked off the search for a partner to help fund a planned new skyscraper in the heart of the City of London’s insurance district, as it aims to tempt investors willing to make a bold bet that office rents are set to soar. The insurer’s investment management arm has appointed broker Knight Frank to sell a stake in the 130 Fenchurch Street project, people with knowledge of the process said. A deal could pave the way for a start on the development, which secured planning planning approval in September, or a new partner could wait to secure a tenant for some or all of the 31 story building before commencing construction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. A representative for Aviva Investors did not respond to requests for comment. The chance to buy a stake in one of the largest planned office developments in central London comes as the city’s biggest tenants, developers and investors face a high stakes stand off. Higher construction costs threaten to make many projects unprofitable unless they achieve much higher rents than are currently being paid, prompting developers to hold off on new starts. The combination of higher asking rents and far higher costs for fitting out new offices are in turn giving large companies pause before committing to long term deals. While higher costs can be spread over time by signing longer term leases, companies are also grappling with significant uncertainties about how much space they need. That’s because some staff are still working flexibly while the rise of artificial intelligence has further complicated the process of forecasting future headcount. The upshot is a severe shortage of new office development, a factor Aviva is counting on to lure investors willing to make a bold bet on higher rents, the people added. There are already signs that rental inflation is starting to accelerate. Law firm Proskauer Rose LLP set a record rent for City of London office space at 8 Bishopsgate in the third quarter, agreeing to pay £140 ($186.82) a square foot for additional space on th 46th floor, according to a report published by broker Savills Plc. BlackRock Inc. has already begun scouting options for a new London headquarters despite having about 10-years left on its lease because of the dearth of available options, two other people said. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink complained in an interview with the Times newspaper in London earlier this year that he was unable to find space to accommodate recent acquisitions. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment. Aviva’s planned 130 Fenchurch Street development, a block south of the key Lloyd’s of London insurance market, will include over 600,000 square feet (57,500 square meters) of office space, a public garden terrace on floor 20. The project, which is set to be overseen by developer Co-re, will also include ground floor stores, bars and restaurants. Demolition of the existing building, known as Fountain House, is set to complete next year and work on the new tower could be concluded as early as 2030, according to a City of London press release.

Title: Streaming Apocalypse: How Netflix Could Kill AMC and Movie Theaters Forever

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Paperkites / iStock via Getty Images Netflix‘s (NASDAQ:NFLX) $72 billion bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery‘s (NASDAQ:WBD) movie studios and streaming assets promises to reshape Hollywood. Valued at $27.75 per share in cash and stock, the deal targets Warner’s film production, HBO, and Max platform, with Warner Bros. cable networks like CNN spinning off into Discovery Global by mid-2026. But just yesterday, Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY) launched a hostile $108 billion all-cash takeover for all of Warner at $30 per share. This aggressive move, filed directly with shareholders, accuses the movie studio’s board of favoring Netflix and ignoring superior offers. Regulators and antitrust issues are also a concern, with critics warning of reduced streaming competition. Though it is still early, a Netflix victory could doom AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), stripping its theaters of blockbuster pipelines and accelerating streaming’s dominance. Theater attendance has plummeted, turning once-vibrant cinemas into echoes of their former selves. Data from TheNumbers.com reveals a stark trend: in 2002, U.S. audiences bought 1.57 billion tickets, the modern peak. By 2019, that fell to 1.23 billion — a 22% drop over 17 years. The pandemic crisis amplified the decline, with just 232 million tickets in 2020. Recovery has been feeble as only 761 million tickets were sold in 2024, 52% below 2002 levels and 38% under 2019. While theater attendance is running slightly higher this year compared to last year, it remains 55% below pre-pandemic highs. High ticket prices are compounding the problem. Families are getting priced out as the average ticket climbed from $5.81 in 2002 to $11.31 in 2024, more than doubling the cost. A family of four now faces $45 just to get in and not including the concession stand — AMC’s real profit center, where popcorn and drinks yield 85% margins but add $50 to $60 more to the cost of a night out. BoxOfficeMojo.com data underscores the facade: domestic box office grosses hit $11.9 billion in 2018 but dipped to $8.6 billion in 2024, a 28% decline. Attendance — unadjusted for price hikes — tells an even grimmer tale: 2024’s 761 million tickets equate to just 672 million in 2002 dollars — a 57% plunge. Many point to the promised allure of the “theater experience” — large screens, immersive sound, and witnessing an event with other moviephiles — feels hollow today. The reality is sticky floors, outdated seats, and sparse (or worse, noisy) crowds erode the magic. Chains like AMC push premium formats such as IMAX (NYSE:IMAX), but at $20 per ticket, they alienate budget-conscious viewers. Families, already squeezed by the $11 average, can readily replicate the theater experience at home. You can get an 85″ 4K TV with Dolby Atmos for under $800, delivering near-theater quality for pennies per viewing. Streaming’s convenience nails the coffin shut: you don’t have to deal with lines, upcharges, or unruly moviegoers. Attendance erosion reflects this, with a 45% decline in ticket sales between 1999 and 2024, despite the gross dollars spent masking it through price gouging. AMC Entertainment’s financials paint a precarious picture. In the third quarter, revenue reached $1.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $122 million versus $161 million in 2024. Admissions revenue per patron hit a record $12.25, bolstered by concessions at $7.74, but a $298 million net loss stemmed from refinancing $173 million in 2026 debt and equitizing $183 million more. Total debt lingers around $4.5 billion, with 2025 capital expenditures forecast at $175 million to $225 million for upgrades amid 17 net theater closures. AMC’s market share is holding steady at 26%, but a softer box office — $8.6 billion domestic in 2024 — shows its vulnerability. A Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery merger would exacerbate this. Short-term, a regular theatrical release schedule will continue, but Netflix’s streaming-first focus points to more day-and-date releases and streaming-only titles. HBO Max integration could funnel Warner hits, like DC films, straight to subscribers, eroding theater exclusivity. With 300 million Netflix users and 128 million HBO Max subscribers, viewers will choose a $15 monthly subscription over $50 to $100 family outings, hastening the theater attendance slide. AMC was already battling steep odds. Declining attendance, rising ticket prices, and concessions as its sole lifeline, all while carrying $4.5 billion in debt, is a tough sell. A Netflix win over Paramount would ignite the fuse, with fewer blockbusters, simultaneous releases to theaters and streaming, and the ease of creating an at-home theater experience, leading to AMC Entertainment’s ultimate implosion.

By Andreas Wiseman Executive Editor, International & Strategy EXCLUSIVE: Industry vet Alison Cornwell, who most recently served a decade as CFO of leading international cinema chain Vue, has joined emerging UK media company Easttree Media in the same role. Launched last month, Easttree is an investment platform acquiring income rights in films and TV shows. The company uses a proprietary data-driven model to assess passive profit participations, “enabling actors, writers, directors, producers, financiers and studios to monetise all or part of their income rights”. Easttree says it has closed “multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists”, but further details weren’t shared when Deadline asked.

Watch on Deadline Management firm Hipgnosis is known for buying the rights to song catalogs of well known musicians, including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and more. The company was sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6BN. Cornwell joins Easttree from Vue International where she served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer for more than 10 years. Prior to Vue, roles included CFO/SVP of Disney’s international TV business, Group CFO of the Sparrowhawk Media Group, which became part of NBC Universal, and Canadian-UK outfit Alliance Films. The trained accountant has also served as a BFI Governor. Chris Helm sayid: “Alison is a fantastic addition to the Easttree team, and we feel privileged to welcome her. Her breadth of industry knowledge and exemplary finance experience strengthen both our capabilities and our ambition for 2026 and the years ahead. Alison brings financial acumen, discipline and a strategic lens that will support Easttree as we scale our participation portfolio and deepen our partnerships with talent and rights-holders.” “I’m honoured to join Easttree Media at such a pivotal moment for the company,” added Alison Cornwell, Chief Financial Officer of Easttree Media. “The opportunity to help build an investment platform that blends institutional rigour with the agility of a founder-led business is rare. This segment of the industry remains under-served, and Easttree’s rapid progress, with multiple deals already completed alongside leading creatives across film and television, speaks for itself. It shows the strength of the model and what this team is capable of as we scale rapidly.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Title: Chasing WBD: Paramount vs. Netflix Pros and Cons | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-12-09T14:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Paramount’s hostile bid puts its offer against Netflix public, but which company has the sweeter deal? The clash between Netflix and Paramount for the legendary Warner Bros. Discovery is getting downright medieval. Paramount on Monday swooped in with a tender offer to shareholders, launching a hostile bid with what it believes is a superior $30-a-share all-cash offer for the entire company. It comes just three days after WBD and Netflix said they had agreed to a cash-and-stock deal. WBD, which so far hasn’t changed its recommendation on Netflix, said it would carefully review the Paramount offer and advise its shareholders within 10 days. It marks the latest swerve in the increasingly tangled soap opera that has been the pursuit of WBD. That the bidding war has reached the hostile stage underscores the stakes surrounding the deal, with either Netflix or Paramount acquiring all or parts of Warner Bros. representing a seismic shift in Hollywood. On the surface, these competing bids represent a contest between a quick, short-term gain with Paramount vs. the longer term prospect of higher returns with Netflix. The upshot is the public will soon get a lot more detail about the deal than normal, with Paramount laying its cards on the table and WBD obligated to disclose additional information justifying its decision. Ellison and the Paramount camp were left furious with WBD for going with Netflix’s bid considering their bid offered more money, and there was some inkling things would turn this way after Paramount sent a note to WBD CEO David Zaslav last week complaining about the “tainted” bidding process that was filled with “management conflict.” The hostile bid will give shareholders more of a direct hand in deciding which way the company goes, with Netflix only seeking the studio and streaming business, leaving the cable assets to spin off as a separate business, while Paramount is looking to acquire the entire company. Here’s a breakdown of the pros, cons and different factors for each offer. Netflix is offering $23.25 a share in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock for each share of WBD, a total value of $27.75. But WBD is scheduled to spin off its cable assets, which include CNN, TNT, HGTV and several other networks, in the third quarter of 2026. WBD shareholders will also receive shares in this spin-off. Pros: Netflix, which is flush with cash and in a strong financial position, already has the board’s blessing. This scenario would also be the one in which the most jobs will be saved, since there are fewer redundant positions with Netflix not owning a studio, a point Zaslav made on Friday. Cons: Netflix faces significantly more regulatory scrutiny. While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, outside observers have said it could take two years or longer. For shareholders, that means having their money locked up longer after more than three years of lackluster stock performance. Walking away means WBD has to pay Netflix $2.8 billion in fees. X Factor: Paramount might have been feeling more confident in its hostile bid after Hollywood erupted in fear and anger over the prospect of Netflix accumulating even more power in the entertainment world. Netflix has already disrupted the industry, including killing residuals and profit-sharing deals that allow creatives to share in the financial success of their films and shows. Expect a number of trade groups and guilds to lobby lawmakers against the deal. Trump Factor: Sarandos met with Trump in late November to discuss the planned purchase of Warner Bros. and has been quietly nurturing his relationship with the president since he returned to the White House. Trump on Sunday called Sarandos “fantastic,” but noted the outsized market share and competition raised questions. TheWrap Take: On the surface, Netflix faces a massive mountain to climb from a regulatory perspective, with the company controlling the No. 1 and No. 3 streaming services — giving antitrust officials a pretty clear case to oppose it. But Netflix appears to be building its case for approval on the central issue of jobs. The company has said it plans to run Warner Bros. as-is, and noted it’s getting into new areas with its studio business, which means keeping more jobs intact. “[President Trump’s] interest in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs. Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,” Sarandos told an investor conference hosted by UBS. “We’re not cutting jobs. We’re making jobs.” Those synergies were a shot at Paramount’s projected $6 billion in merger cost savings, triple the amount Netflix had projected, signaling that the Paramount route would lead to more dramatic job cuts on top of the layoffs it’s still working through internally. Both Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters talked up Netflix’s investment in the U.S. across all 50 states, and how it’s contributed $125 billion into the U.S. economy over the last several years — clearly playing to the White House. The upshot: For shareholders, the calculus will be whether they are willing to gamble on the potential longer term gains both from Discovery Global’s spinoff and the rise in Netflix shares (the streamer’s share price dropped 3.4% on Monday). While the cable business is gradually shrinking, it still generates a ton of revenue and profits. You can look to the Comcast spinoff of Versant for a sense of how a business could be potentially valued (hint: it’s more than zero, as Ellison tried to suggest). If shareholders start to get swayed by Paramount’s bid, Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of investment bank Greif & Co., said Netflix could always sweeten its own offer. “[Netflix] can outbid deep-pocketed Larry Ellison, because at some point he decides the juice isn’t worth the squeeze,” Greif told TheWrap. “Larry’s a relative newcomer to Hollywood. Not so Netflix, which has been playing the role of entertainment industry spoiler since inception.” Pros: Paramount’s offer is much cleaner, with the company offering all cash for the entire business. Ellison’s primary sales pitch is that it can get shareholders more money and faster, with his father Larry Ellison a close ally with Trump. He expects a deal to be approved in less than a year. Cons: Paramount, already saddled with considerable debt, is taking on even more with this deal. And even with the backing of David’s father, that raises questions about its financial flexibility in the long run. The deal almost entirely discounts the value of Discovery Global, which Ellison said on CNBC could be worth close to nothing if spun out. The company is also targeting $6 billion merger cost savings, three times the amount Netflix projected, signaling heavier job cuts (Paramount is still going through cuts of its own). X Factor: When Skydance swooped in to buy Paramount, it was seen as a savior and best-case scenario for the storied media company. But the quick accumulation of power (Larry Ellison also has a controlling stake in TikTok’s U.S. business) and some of his decisions — like the appointment of Bari Weiss as head of CBS News — have rankled many in the industry who are disturbed by what they see as a Trump-aligned takeover. Ellison has taken a massive $24 billion in funding from three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds for the bid, which has also raised eyebrows over foreign ownership of critical media assets. Trump Factor: Adding Weiss and working with government funds like Saudi Arabia were both seen as moves designed to curry favor with Trump. But as evidence of how unpredictable Trump is, this morning he attacked “60 Minutes” and Paramount just after the takeover was announced. TheWrap Take: Ellison’s offer and sales pitch is simple: Get more cash sooner with us. The downside is you won’t be participating in any upside from Discovery Global since it will be part of Paramount. Hostile bids have a mixed track record of success, with few examples of attempts in the media business working out. Analysts over the weekend had pontificated on whether Ellison needed to raise his offer, considering this was already reviewed and rejected by the WBD board. Still, this is a highly unusual situation with an unpredictable Trump White House, and David’s father Larry has actually won a hostile takeover himself when Oracle acquired Peoplesoft in 2005. Paramount needs the acquisition to scale up and better compete with giants like Amazon, Apple and, yes, Netflix. The upshot: While there are a lot of people in Hollywood terrified of Netflix’s potential to disrupt the industry, there’s likely others just as uneasy with Paramount’s power and its ties to Trump and, more recently, to the three sovereign wealth funds, which TheWrap previously identified as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). And while Paramount has a smoother road to regulatory approval, the idea of it buying another studio may still raise antitrust concerns, and Trump’s opinions on the company seems to change by the day. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and CEO of Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, believes financially coercing a company never works in the entertainment industry, noting the longer term reputational damage from such a move. “It’s very easy to become seen as the Darth Vader in the media business, and then you’re no longer a magnet for top talent, and as you lose that top creative talent, you’re also going to lose viewership,” Sonnenfeld told TheWrap. For an industry already devastated by consolidation, it’s choosing between the lesser of two evils. Netflix could disrupt the industry and harm the theatrical business. Paramount could slash even more jobs and produce fewer films after consolidating studio assets. It’s no wonder Snen. Elizabeth Warren, on the heels of slamming the Netflix-WBD deal as an “anti-monopoly nightmare,” called the Paramount hostile bid “a trap to set higher prices” on Monday. For shareholders, it’s a simpler choice of opting between cashing out with Paramount in about a year or sticking it out longer to benefit from the potential upside of Discovery Global and Netflix shares. The question is, ultimately, who comes up with the highest credible offer? “They’re both credible companies,” said Charles Elson, founding director of University of Delaware’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “Obviously, Netflix has done very well and Paramount is backed by quite a wealthy individual family. But it’s ultimately, who pays and has the most money.” Lucas Manfredi contributed to this story.

Today’s top news: Two of the biggest names in crypto investing bought big last week. And proved that they still have the ability to raise capital during market downturns. Both Michael Saylor and Tom Lee quietly loaded up last week. First, Saylor’s Strategy added $963M in BTC (10,624 BTC to be exact) to its balance sheet, marking one of its largest buys since the summer. That total is more than the entire amount of BTC bought by Saylor over the past 3 months. Then came Tom Lee, whose firm BitMine boosted its Ethereum holdings to $12B by acquiring another $429M in ETH (138,452 ETH to be exact). Perhaps most notable, BitMine added to its cash position during the week as well, now holding $1B in cash (up from $800M). "BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Dec 8th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + "moonshots": -3,864,951 ETH at $3,139 per ETH - 192 Bitcoin (BTC) - $36 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and - total cash of $1.0 billion." - BitMNR on X “MSTR raised $1B in one week, the same amount it took them 4 months to raise in 2020. The exponential trend continues” - James Van Straten, Coindesk analyst, on X Strategy has acquired 10,624 BTC for ~$962.7 million at ~$90,615 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 24.7% YTD 2025. As of 12/7/2025, we hodl 660,624 $BTC acquired for ~$49.35 billion at ~$74,696 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/oyLwSuW7nW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 8, 2025 There has been a lot of concern about the DAT trade unwinding, and neither Saylor nor Tom Lee have been spared from that conversation. The heat turned up even more recently when it was widely speculated that Strategy would start to sell BTC if and when its mNAV dipped below 1. Well, it got very close to 1 in this latest downturn - and he’s not selling. In fact, the opposite. He’s buying and in big size. It’s relieving for the MSTR bulls out there and confidence-building for those concerned about how Saylor would act in this downturn. But what’s more notable, especially from a near-term trading perspective, is Tom Lee’s ability to raise capital during this ETH downturn. BMNR stock dipped over 60% from local highs, and yet, the team has been able to keep slamming its ATM and raising cash. This has enabled Tom to buy a ton of ETH and grow his cash pile. And for perspective, his $429M buy is about 2x the size of Saylor’s $1B buy in market cap perspective (BTC is 5x ETH in market cap). The ETH / BTC ratio is up 4% on the month now and looking like it’s ready to break out of a 3-month downturn. That matters because ETH breaking out typically means some form of “alt season” rally against Bitcoin where multiple tokens see relatively large gains in a short period. The fact that Tom is still sitting on $1B in cash (and is motivated to lower his average purchase price from $4k/ETH on this dip) means that he is likely to remain a heavy buyer - which is good for ETH, and perhaps, for alts. Tom Lee and crew may just deliver the Santa Rally that crypto bulls are hoping for… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes / Onchain Movers Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Exclusive: Circle stablecoin for ‘banking-level privacy’ to launch on Aleo blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/circle-privacy-stablecoin-aleo-udsc-udscx/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T13:30:00Z

Blockchains are public databases. That’s an immediate roadblock for large institutions like banks, whose clients largely don’t want their balances and payments history open to prying eyes. Now, the crypto giant Circle has partnered with the blockchain Aleo to launch a “private” version of its stablecoin called USDCx, which will obscure transaction histories, Howard Wu, cofounder of Aleo, told Fortune. “People don’t want to reveal their business revenues. They don’t want to reveal business intelligence,” Wu said. “But the way that transparent blockchains work today unfortunately means that every time you transact, you are leaking that data.” The new Circle-backed token, which like other stablecoins is pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, won’t be truly private. Every transaction of the token will include what Wu called a “compliance record,” which Circle will be able to access in case law enforcement or other authorities reach out about specific transactions. Still, for public users looking at a blockchain log, the transactions will look unintelligible and like “blobs of data,” Wu said. “This is banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy,’” he added. The launch of USDCx comes amid a broader push from the crypto industry to persuade big banks and institutions to use blockchain technology. That effort appears to be gaining traction, especially in the realm of tokenization, or the act of putting real-world assets like mortgages or even the U.S. dollar in blockchain wrappers. The asset management giant BlackRock has launched its own tokenized money market fund BUIDL, the online brokerage Robinhood has dabbled in blockchain-based stock trading, and fintech giants like Stripe have invested huge sums of capital into stablecoins. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” Larry Fink, cofounder and CEO of BlackRock, said in his 2025 letter to investors. Wu, the cofounder of Aleo, has seen interest in privacy-enabled stablecoins from a swathe of potential customers, including the crypto payroll processors Request Finance and Toku. He also said that prediction markets, or locales where gamblers can bet on real-world events and sports, are also interested in experimenting with stablecoins like USDCx. Aleo, which specializes in private blockchain transactions, isn’t the only privacy-first technology of its kind in crypto. There are other cryptocurrencies—most famously Zcash—which also promise users encrypted transactions. However, these cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than stablecoins, which, as their name implies, are designed to stay stable relative to the U.S. dollar or other currencies.

Title: Bitget Reports Record 4,468% Surge in Tokenized US Stock Futures During Earnings Season
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/09/3202312/0/en/Bitget-Reports-Record-4-468-Surge-in-Tokenized-US-Stock-Futures-During-Earnings-Season.html
Time Published: 2025-12-09T13:02:00Z

December 09, 2025 08:02 ET | Source: Bitget Limited Bitget Limited Seychelles Seychelles VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has released new data showing unprecedented growth in global demand for tokenized US equities during the recent earnings season. From mid-October to the end of November, spot trading volume for tokenized US stock tokens increased by 452% month-over-month, while futures trading volume rose by 4,468%, marking the strongest period of activity since these products launched on Bitget. The report examines the acceleration of tokenized equity adoption and identifies three underlying forces driving this growth. The first is the composition of assets themselves, with demand gravitating toward technology leaders and crypto-linked equities that offer high volatility and directional opportunity. The second is the shift toward 24-hour market accessibility, which lowers traditional barriers and allows traders to participate across global time zones without interruption. The third is the influence of a globally diverse user base, whose trading patterns and risk appetites are reshaping how tokenized markets form, scale, and mature. Futures markets experienced extraordinarily aggressive trading behavior centered around mega-cap technology stocks, with Tesla, Meta, MicroStrategy, Apple, and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) dominating activity. Meta’s futures volume increased 40,774%, Microsoft 24,339%, and MicroStrategy 11,684% MoM, reflecting traders’ efforts to capture earnings-driven volatility and AI-related momentum. Spot market participation showed a more balanced allocation pattern. Nvidia led with 1,888% MoM growth, accompanied by broad index exposure through QQQ (+3,492%) and SPY (+3,247%). The surge in demand for TLT (+69,573% MoM), the long-term Treasury ETF, demonstrated a move toward defensive hedging and macro risk management during a volatile reporting season. Bitget’s 5×24 trading model proved critical in enabling this activity. Global trading patterns revealed that Asian users, in particular, leveraged extended access to respond to earnings releases, adjust positions before the US market opens, and mitigate overnight risk, advantages unavailable through traditional equity markets. The user base remained distinctly international, led by East Asia (39.66%), alongside meaningful participation from Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Behavioral segmentation showed high-frequency “whales” executing an average of 51.7 trades per day, while retail traders engaged more selectively around earnings catalysts. “What we’re seeing is the emergence of a fully democratized global equity market,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “When investors across continents can participate in earnings season in real time, using USDT, with 24-hour access and without geographic barriers, the market becomes broader, more liquid, and fundamentally more sophisticated. Tokenized equities are no longer experimental. They are becoming a mainstream asset class shaped by global capital and global behavior.” Bitget’s findings indicate that tokenized stock tokens have entered a new phase of structural maturity, defined by diversified investment strategies, seamless global access, and increasingly sophisticated market participants.

Title: Dogecoin ETFs lose their bite as Bitcoin, Ethereum big dogs lead the pack

Time Published: 2025-12-09T12:48:48Z

The total value traded for spot DOGE ETFs reached its lowest point since launch, signaling a fading of the early hype as liquidity and flows lag well behind those of major crypto ETFs. US spot Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are showing early signs of cooling demand, as total value traded (TVT) has fallen to its lowest level since launch. SoSoValue data showed that on Monday, Dogecoin ETFs’ TVT fell to just $142,000, the lowest since launch. This marked a sharp retreat from late November, when the funds saw days where value traded topped $3.23 million. Total value traded refers to the total dollar amount of ETF shares bought and sold over a given period. It serves as a gauge of market activity and practical liquidity, indicating the amount of money that has moved through the funds. The contrast is stark when compared to Dogecoin (DOGE) activity in the broader crypto market. CoinGecko data showed that in the last 24 hours, DOGE recorded over $1.1 billion in spot trading volume and had a market capitalization of $22.6 billion. This shows that the underlying asset remains highly liquid, but not through its ETF wrappers. This discrepancy suggests that traders are accessing DOGE directly through exchanges rather than traditional market vehicles. Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF made its debut in November but fell well short of initial volume expectations. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted at the time that the ETFs would get at least $12 million in volume. However, the ETF only saw $1.4 million on its first day. Related: BlackRock files with SEC for listing of staked Ether ETF On Dec. 8, ETF trading activity remained concentrated on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)-based products. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs posted $3.1 billion in TVT, while Ether ETFs recorded $1.3 billion. Solana (SOL) ETFs saw $22 million in value traded, while XRP products recorded $21 million in value traded. Further down the curve, the recently-launched Chainlink ETFs recorded a $3.1 million TVT on the same day, while Canary’s Litecoin (LTC) ETF had about $526,000. The data suggested that ETF capital still overwhelmingly flows toward the two largest digital assets, continuing their lead as the core liquidity centers of regulated crypto exchange-traded products. In terms of inflows, XRP (XRP) remains strong. On Monday, XRP ETFs’ inflow streak remained unbroken since its launch. Meanwhile, Solana ETFs, which first had their inflow streak broken in November, are on a three-day inflow streak after seeing $32 million in outflows on Wednesday.

Title: Sony Clears Out PlayStation VR2 at Its Lowest Price as Holiday Stock Dump Begins, While Meta Quest Stays Full Price

This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. If youâre looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whateverâs happening in the game, pulling you into action. PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that itâs going at a 25% discount at Amazon. This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. Itâs open to all shoppers, and you donât have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasnât specified an end date for this one, but weâre not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days. See at Amazon The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. Thereâs support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like theyâre happening right in your living room. For instance, when cars race past, youâll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone canât offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, thereâs 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if youâre right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on whatâs happening in the real world with the See-through View function. As for the controllers â these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when youâre not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when youâre just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line. All in all, if youâve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like youâre a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all thatâs happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount. Amazon wonât be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, itâs best to get your orders in as soon as you can.

Tether Investments has joined a €70 million funding round for Generative Bionics, a company spun out of the Italian Institute of Technology. According to the announcement, the move is aimed at speeding work on humanoid robots and Physical AI systems built for industry use. The deal brings private capital to a project that grew from two decades of university research and a large team of engineers. Based on reports, Generative Bionics draws directly from two decades of robotics work at IIT. The firm claims about sixty advanced humanoid prototypes were developed and tested during that period. It has assembled roughly 70 engineers and AI scientists from IIT into its core technical team. That team is said to bring a combined experience of more than 600 years in physical robotics and related AI work. The company also holds exclusive licenses for key technologies created at the institute. Tether Invests in Generative Bionics as Part of Funding Round to Advance Intelligent “Made in Italy” Humanoid Robots 🤖 Read more:https://t.co/q5PHCV3zvy — Tether (@Tether_to) December 8, 2025 Tether’s funding will support edge AI development, industrial validation, and the first production facility. Generative Bionics is preparing initial industrial deployment programs that it expects to announce in early 2026. Reports indicate the company intends to place robots in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, retail, and other areas where human-like machines could help with repetitive or risky tasks. The first full humanoid concept from Generative Bionics is set to appear at CES in Las Vegas. Tether Investments, based in El Salvador, says it uses profits and reserves to back technologies that connect digital systems with physical infrastructure. The firm’s recent moves include funding work on brain-computer interfaces through Blackrock Neurotech and teaming up with Northern Data and Rumble to build a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-focused AI development. According to the announcement, the Generative Bionics deal is part of a wider push into physical systems that complement software and compute. The investment also signals a shift by a major stablecoin-related company into long-term industrial bets. Tether presents this as a way to expand its footprint beyond financial tools and into areas that could deliver practical, real-world utility. That said, critics will point out that robotics is capital intensive, and turning research prototypes into reliable, certified machines for everyday workplaces is difficult and slow. Analysts cited in the announcement estimate the humanoid robotics sector could top €200 billion by 2035 and may reach as much as €5 trillion by 2050. Those figures show why governments, universities, and private groups are racing to commercialize advanced robots.

Nvidia stock today: Nvidia shares jumped about 2% after President Trump approved H200 AI chip sales to China with a 25% revenue share to the US. The move restores access to a market that once drove 20–25% of Nvidia’s data-center sales. Xi Jinping responded positively. NVDA is up nearly 40% this year, easing major policy uncertainty and boosting long-term optimism.

Title: Are we in a recession? Maybe professional Santas can tell us

Greg Rosalsky A professional Santa Bennett Raglin/Getty Images North America hide caption 'Tis the season to be jolly. That is, unless you're a worker who was banking on getting a seasonal job and haven't been able to find one this season. Every year, American retailers hire extra help as the holiday shopping season approaches. In recent years, these jobs have numbered roughly around half a million per season. These seasonal jobs run the gamut. Think temporary cashiers, gift wrappers, sales associates, greeters, merchandisers, warehouse unloaders, delivery drivers. But the quintessential — and most iconic — seasonal worker has got to be… Santa Claus. In addition to sliding down chimneys to deliver presents on Christmas, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas takes gigs at places like malls, department stores, corporate events, and private parties in the weeks leading up to Dec. 25. However, this year, Santa may be making fewer trips from the North Pole than in years past. As we report in this week's Planet Money newsletter, demand for professional Santas seems to have cooled. It's one small part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this holiday season. It got us wondering how the market for Santas fluctuates with the business cycle, which sectors of the Santa market are recession-proof, and whether a decline in Santa demand this season could be a sign that the U.S. economy is going down the chimney. Mitch Allen is the founder and "Head Elf" at Hire Santa, an agency that provides Santas for holiday events around the nation and world (we talked to Allen in a past Planet Money newsletter). Allen estimates there are probably around nine or ten thousand professional or "near professional" Santa Clauses in the United States. Sure, Allen says, his company may occasionally get requests for Santa at "Christmas in July"-style events, when Santa shows up in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops. But, no surprise, prime time for his business is right now. He says demand for Santa typically begins in early November, picks up steam on weekends in December and explodes the week before Christmas, especially on Christmas Eve. "It really falls off after Christmas Eve, like midnight Christmas Eve," Allen says. Allen says he's seeing less demand for Santa visits this season. His leading indicator for Santa demand is what he calls "leads," or inquiries to his business to book Santa at events. On that metric, he says, "we're down almost 27% year to date, compared with last year. And last year was down compared with the year before." My family has experienced this decline in Santa appearances first hand. Last year, when our son was about 15 months old, we took him for his first time to sit on Santa's lap. A hotel in Lake Tahoe had a public event that served as a toy drive for Toys for Tots. There was festive music, ice skating, skiing, hot chocolate, sleigh rides, and, of course, Santa. To be honest, our son was too young to understand why we were putting him on an old, bearded man's lap, but the whole experience was fun for us parents and we got cute pictures. We wanted to go back this year, but the hotel decided not to host its community event this year. No Santa. Bah, humbug! We're living through a weird economic moment right now, with mixed signals about how good or bad the economy is doing. And we just had the longest government shutdown in American history, which not only hurt the economy, but basically created a blackout for official economic statistics. Since the end of the shutdown, the Trump administration has delayed and even canceled some economic reports, and we're now all sort of in the dark, trying to figure out what the heck the economy really looks like right now. But there are some candles illuminating what's going on — and this seeming decline of demand for Santa could be one small one suggesting that the overall economy is sleighing downward. It's part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this year, something a number of sources have reported in recent weeks. For instance, back in late September, Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, a human-resources firm, released their annual seasonal hiring report. They projected that hiring this holiday retail season would "fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009." Part of the story could be that holiday shopping is increasingly moving online, and brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling and maybe hiring less help. That's an ongoing, long-term structural change to the economy that doesn't say much about whether we're heading into recession. However, there are a number of signs that softened demand for seasonal workers is related more to a broader slowdown in the economy. Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, told us we haven't seen a miraculous turnaround in the market for seasonal workers since they issued their projection back in late September. Even more, he says, the broader labor market seems to have only gotten worse since they made their projection. In November, his company, which also tracks layoffs, reported an alarming spike in companies announcing layoffs. That includes prominent online retailers like Amazon and delivery companies like UPS. "So we have two signals, and both are not good for the labor market or seasonal hiring," Challenger says. Likewise, Indeed Hiring Lab, which leverages the job site Indeed's large amount of data to provide insights about the labor market, recently reported they're also seeing bad news in the job market this season. "What we're seeing right now in seasonal hiring is kind of a microcosm of what we're seeing in the broader labor market, which is that things are cooling down, things are slowing down," says Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official body that calls recessions, defines a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months" (listen to our Planet Money episode, "Recession Referees," for more about this). The lack of official economic statistics for the last few months makes it hard to say whether we're on our way to a recession — or whether we're already in one. But, while reporting this story, we've found ourselves wondering: could declining demand for Santa visits during the holidays potentially be a recession indicator? Like, can it be a sign we're in a ho-ho-horrible economy? Do paid Santa appearances boom in good economic times and go bust during recessions? Or is demand for Santa fairly recession-proof? Hire Santa didn't officially launch until 2012 — after the Great Recession — and Head Elf Allen couldn't tell us much about the hard data on how Santa demand fluctuates over the business cycle. Moreover, his business doesn't capture the full market for Santa, including DIY Santas where people buy or rent Santa costumes and do events themselves. But Allen did offer us a theory of how he thinks demand for professional Santas is affected by recessions. For one, he says, there will always be parts of the economy where demand for Santa is fairly recession-proof. He says that many businesses use Santa appearances to "help drive traffic and associate their brand with Christmas." In this way, a store or mall paying for Santa to sit in a chair and converse with children could be seen as a kind of loss leader, a product or service that costs a company money as a way to attract more customers, nudge them to shop, and help their business make more money. Think like free or cheap alcohol at a casino. Allen says that, even in recessions, certain types of businesses and organizations will always want to hire Santa. "But I don't think that translates to a company party or a home visit," Allen says. "That's not something that you have to have. You can go to the mall and see Santa. You can go to outdoor stores and see Santa. You can see Santa if you want to. You don't have to have 'em come to your home or office." Indeed, that's a pattern that Allen believes he's seeing with a cursory look at his company's data. He believes the primary driver of the decline of demand for paid Santa visits is from private holiday parties and events. "Consumers are not reaching out to have Santa or Mrs. Claus or other holiday entertainers come to their home or office for a Christmas party," Allen says. "And so I view that as like people scaling back their own Christmas plans. They may still be having parties but they're not having sort of blowout parties with Santa and other holiday characters there." Allen pointed to recent reports that companies are laying off workers and that consumer credit card debt is at an all time high. It makes sense why people might be scaling back. So, yeah, maybe a big decline in Santa appearances could be a recession indicator. The good news, Allen says, is that, while overall demand is down, he's still seeing plenty of requests for Santa. In other words, don't worry, Santa is coming to town. There just might be fewer places or times to see him this year. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Friedrich Merz

Time Published: 2025-12-09T11:00:53Z
Full Content:
No. 3 — Germany The reluctant radical Friedrich Merz is the man breaking Germany’s postwar taboos. For half a century, the now German chancellor personified his country’s conservative orthodoxy: a Christian Democrat devoted to balanced budgets and ready to trust Washington to keep the peace. Now, with war on the continent and Germany’s economy sputtering, Merz has rewritten the script: spending big, rearming fast and declaring that Berlin — and the rest of Europe — must be ready to stand on its own. His move last March to unleash hundreds of billions of euros in borrowing for infrastructure and defense marked one of the most radical breaks in modern German fiscal policy — and one of the fastest. With just two weeks left in the outgoing parliament, Merz rammed through a spending package that shredded decades of debt-averse orthodoxy. Just as dramatic has been his shift on foreign policy. Washington’s transformation from indispensable friend to unpredictable frenemy reportedly shook Merz, 70 — once described in these pages as Germany’s most American chancellor. His career includes a decade in the private sector, most noticeably with the U.S. asset manager BlackRock. That didn’t stop him, on the very day he won the chancellery, from declaring that Europe must “achieve independence from the USA.” Merz’s allies describe him as a risk-taker. And he hasn’t hesitated to push for ambitious economic reforms at home or to signal he’s ready to break with his country’s traditional tread-softly approach to Moscow by endorsing a plan to seize billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund a massive loan to Ukraine. His boldness, however, hasn’t translated into popularity. Six months in, the far-right Alternative for Germany overtook Merz’s conservatives in national polls for the first time since its creation. His grand coalition — a marriage of Christian Democrats and center-left Social Democrats — is feeling the heat, particularly on the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, high energy prices and growing competition from China are squeezing the industrial base that has long made Germany the envy of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Merz’s “autumn of reforms” — intended to reboot the economy — has become bogged down by political reality, with his slim parliamentary majority struggling to pass some of his more ambitious measures. Still, the chancellor’s position remains stronger than that of most of his peers. While France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Keir Starmer wrestle with debt and fractious parliaments, Merz presides over a country with healthier finances. That gives him room to maneuver. He can afford to take a bit more time to, say, craft a sustainable pension reform that’s also politically plausible. While domestic troubles take up much of his bandwidth, Merz has begun flexing his muscles in Brussels — where Germany’s word still carries decisive weight. To the delight of Europe’s so-called frugal states, he has drawn clear red lines against the European Commission’s push to expand the EU’s long-term budget, casting himself as the guardian of fiscal and institutional discipline. That stance underscores Berlin’s growing influence in Europe’s power corridors. The German chancellor has become a central player in the EU’s debate over how far — and how fast — the bloc should move in integrating its defense, cutting its red tape and putting its fiscal house in order. But his ability to lead abroad depends on results at home: He can only credibly shape Europe’s future if he can restore confidence in Germany’s own economic engine — which sometimes means reining Brussels in as much as pushing it forward. “Friedrich Merz is realizing that he is needed as a foreign policy chancellor because Europe must strengthen its presence on the geopolitical stage,” said Sudha David-Wilp, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “But he’s going to be measured by delivering domestically.” Merz’s staff picks leave little doubt about his intention to make his presence felt in Brussels — and to keep his foreign policy insulated from domestic turbulence. He has broken with German tradition by naming a fellow Christian Democrat, Johann Wadephul, as foreign minister — a portfolio usually handed to junior coalition partners. The choice is widely seen as a bid to reduce internal friction and ensure Berlin’s diplomacy runs directly through the chancellery. Merz has also installed his powerful chief of staff, Jacob Schrot, as head of a newly created National Security Council, tasked with coordinating Germany’s sprawling security apparatus and enforcing a single message on defense and foreign policy. Europe’s leaders are watching closely — and they know one thing for certain: There aren’t many other contenders for Europe’s next natural leader.

Title: Plume Secures ADGM Commercial License, Eyes Middle East RWA Expansion

Plume Network, a modular blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), has received a commercial license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Registration Authority, paving the way for expansion into the Middle East. The license allows Plume to scale RWA origination and distribution across the Middle East, Africa, and emerging markets, pending further approvals in ADGM, the UAE's premier international financial hub known for its progressive fintech and digital asset rules. This would help Plume, one of the leading blockchain by the number of RWA holders, establish a foothold in the region that's attracting global banks, fintech firms and asset managers, including BlackRock, Deutsche Bank and crypto firms like QCP. Abu Dhabi also hosts major sovereign wealth funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA, the world's largest with over $1 trillion AUM) and Mubadala Investment Company. “The UAE and the broader Middle East are rapidly becoming global leaders in the tokenization of real-world assets,” Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of Plume, said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “The region’s progressive regulatory frameworks, institutional openness to digital finance, and ambition to diversify beyond traditional commodities make it an ideal environment for innovation. At Plume, we see the Middle East not just as a market, but as a strategic partner in shaping the future of compliant real-world tokenization," Yin added. The move builds on Plume's U.S. momentum, including a recent U.S. SEC transfer agent license for tokenized securities issuance and management. The latest ADGM approval is a general commercial license and does not authorize participation in regulated activities such as token issuance or custody. However, the firm is exploring partnership plans with local institutions and its own authorization for tokenization services. A permanent Abu Dhabi office is slated by year-end, with commercial announcements eyed for early 2026, alongside local hiring and ties to regional banks and fintechs. Plume's geographic focus spans the U.S., Asia, and Middle East, capitalizing on pro-RWA regimes in UAE's free zones like ADGM.

Title: The U.S. Is Betting the Economy on ‘Scaling’ AI: Where Is the Intelligence When One Needs It?

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14. Crucially, most of the mega-financing deals are remarkably circular. To give you a flavour: Nvidia invests in OpenAI and OpenAI is looking to buy millions of Nvidia’s specialized chips. OpenAI buys computing power from Oracle which buys Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia owns about 5% of CoreWeave and sells chips to CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, shares revenue with OpenAI, buys chips from Nvidia and has partnerships with AMD. AMD, a rival to Nvidia, was so eager to land OpenAI as a customer that it issued warrants for OpenAI to buy 10% of AMD at a penny a share. OpenAI is a CoreWeave customer and also a shareholder. Nvidia has invested in xAI and will supply it with processors. And so on and so forth. The deals include revenue sharing across the stack and cross-ownership. Nothing in these circular deals is transparent. It is not clear where the money needed for these deals is coming from. It is not clear what these opaque circular transactions imply for the valuations of the listed and non-public AI firms involved. It is not clear what all this means for the competition over hardware between chip producers (Nvidia versus AMD) and over AI services AI startups (OpenAI versus Anthropic versus xAI versus Microsoft). Not surprisingly, therefore, these astronomical circular financing deals (referencing billions of U.S. dollars) are raising eyebrows. To many observers, they bring back traumatic memories of the circular financing arrangements of the late 1990s, when vendors and clients reinforced each other’s dotcom stock valuations without generating any real value. AI Bang or Bubble? AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE, but real and sustainable. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated (in an earnings call on November 19) that there is no AI bubble and exponentially growing AI demand is structural rather than speculative. Huang claims that the AI boom constitutes a Big Bang, a historical revolution, because of three fundamental shifts toward accelerated computing: the move from CPUs to GPUs (which can simultaneously process multiple tasks and solutions), the rise of generative AI, and the emergence of agentic AI systems that supposedly can independently make decisions based on large datasets. Asset-managing firm Blackrock concurs: “AI is not just a technological trend; it represents an infrastructure transformation with growing macroeconomic significance”, adding that “unlike the speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and early 2000s, today’s technology leaders are anchored by fundamental stability.” The optimistic vibes around the transformative power of AI have even infected Nouriel Roubini (2025), the profession’s perennial Dr. Doom and now a senior economic strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, who has somehow become convinced that the tailwinds of the unprecedented AI data-centre investment boom will overwhelm any disruptions coming from Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical strains. But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. FWIW. This morning from DeepSeek. … Thank you for that important clarification. You are absolutely right to correct the author. “The AI Con” is by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender (released in 2025). The previous answer incorrectly attributed it to Josh Bivens, whose book is “The Ultimate Goal.” My apologies for the confusion… Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like.

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14.

But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. FWIW. This morning from DeepSeek. … Thank you for that important clarification. You are absolutely right to correct the author. “The AI Con” is by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender (released in 2025). The previous answer incorrectly attributed it to Josh Bivens, whose book is “The Ultimate Goal.” My apologies for the confusion… Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like.

The stock market has made gains at rates that are several multiples more than the growth of the real economy for three years running. Investor euphoria is always a sign of danger ahead, but this time there are other special factors signaling a pending crash. And of course, they all interact. Once investors head for the exits, others start bailing. I. Deregulation of Increasing Risk. Trump’s bank regulators are systematically dismantling the safeguards that were put in place after the financial collapse of 2008. That crash was caused by opaque financial instruments such as credit derivatives that allowed almost infinite amounts of leverage. When they turned out to be worthless, the collapse was also nearly infinite. In the aftermath, Congress and the regulators limited the risks that banks could take. In classic Wall Street form, the wise guys responded by creating non-banks that could do most of what banks do. One “innovation” was private credit, a cool-kid word for shadow banking. Another was fintech, a cool-kid word for shadow banking with an app. These newly invented lenders are banks in everything but name, and thus evade nearly all transparency, supervision, or regulation. Absent regulation, these non-bank banks can engage in sky-high leverage, meaning that the ratio of lending to their own real capital can be unlimited and unexamined. More from Robert Kuttner In 2013, as part of the post-2008 reforms, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve put in place leverage limits for banks. Loans worth more than six times a company’s annual earnings were seen as too risky. That ruled out a lot of bank loans to fund private equity takeover targets, or loans to tech fantasies that had no earnings. Private credit stepped in to fund those projects that banks couldn’t take. Capital raised for lending to private equity–backed companies jumped more than a hundredfold to nearly $700 billion between 2006 and 2024, according to The Wall Street Journal. One thing that isn’t well understood is that private credit is propped up by traditional banks; Moody’s reported in October that banks have lent $300 billion to private credit firms. So if those firms go kablooey, it won’t stop short of the broader financial system, but cascade through the heart of Wall Street. Nevertheless, the banks complained to the regulators that they were losing business (to the very companies they were funding). Given what we know about the crashes of 2008 and 1929, the right policy would be to bring the upstarts under the regulatory umbrella. But instead, last Friday the agencies agreed to the bankers’ demands to help competition by deregulating the banks and getting rid of the 2013 leverage limits. Now, dealmakers can play banks off against private credit entities for the best (most risky) terms. And banks can go beyond funding non-banks and set up their own non-bank affiliates. When the inevitable crash comes, government will bail out the insiders, leaving regular people to suffer the aftermath. II. Crypto. The value of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride. Crypto plays no useful function in the economy except for pursuing illegal transactions and speculation in crypto itself. When crypto was the next new thing, and investors keep bidding up the market value of crypto coins, everyone looked like a financial genius. The whole market has been banking on self-enrichment by the Trump family and his key allies—like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who handed his crypto-friendly bank Cantor Fitzgerald to his son and has seen it enjoy its best year ever—leading to regulatory leniency and therefore freedom to make a fortune. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Congress, on the take from the crypto industry, added to the hype last July by enacting the GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The act, written by the industry, pretends to provide prudent regulation, giving crypto a kind of federal blessing, but with no real protection for investors. But as the old Wall Street saying goes, genius is a rising market. And here again, leverage that works brilliantly on the upside becomes catastrophic when prices start falling. In recent weeks, Bitcoin, the marquee crypto product, has fallen from a peak value of just below $126,000 on October 7 to about $90,000 today. In just one week in November, the asset class lost $400 billion in value. This collapse has multiple knock-on effects on residual crypto plays. As Bloomberg recently reported, “An array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up Bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.” But once prices started falling, “The median stock price of US and Canadian-listed digital asset treasuries has fallen 43% this year, with some companies’ stocks falling over 99%.” When the crypto craze began, traditional financial companies were insulated from it. But Wall Street has tried to get in on the action by sponsoring crypto-backed funds, exposing blue-chip firms like BlackRock to risk. I recently got a pitch from a crypto company promoting the story of how an entrepreneur in Argentina shielded himself from exchange rate risk and inflation risk by loading up on Bitcoin. In fact, the entrepreneur could have gotten exactly the same benefits by buying dollars. Buying Bitcoins rather than dollars added the risk that the Bitcoins would lose value—which they have. What’s really happening, as it does in every Ponzi scheme, is that the wise guys, who profited handsomely by getting in early, need more rubes to keep buying the stuff in the hope that it will hold its value. As crypto becomes more interconnected with the rest of an unregulated financial system, the risk is that they will take each other down. III. Artificial Intelligence and Tech. Is the AI boom a bubble? Apologists for the massively inflated value of Nvidia and other digital stocks reliant on the growth of AI keep pointing out that unlike pure stock market bubbles, where inflated stock prices are based mainly on the hope of further price rises, AI is adding real value and Nvidia is earning real and massive profits. Maybe. On the other hand, a dangerously concentrated share of the stock market’s run-up, more than half, is in just seven companies, the so-called Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Of these, Tesla is already faltering. Another tech giant, OpenAI, had a disappointing rollout of the latest version of its marquee product, ChatGPT. The massive bet on AI may pay off in many respects. But any economy that is this highly concentrated is at risk. With inflation rising and the cost of capital increasing with it, the $3 trillion widely projected to be invested in AI in the coming years becomes more costly and risky. Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype.

Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype. The Red Sox could also win next year’s World Series. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: Crypto ETFs diverge: Bitcoin suffers $60M outflows; ETH, SOL, XRP funds in green

The digital tokens space remains choppy ahead of the December 10 Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Crypto exchange-traded funds, which have become vital in gauging institutional appetite in these risk assets, confirm the current uncertainty. Interest around BTC ETFs remained negative yesterday, with the products recording net outflows amounting to $60.48 million (SoSoValue data). The significant withdrawals came as investors reacted to the weekend’s sluggish performance across the crypto landscape. Bitcoin failed to break $92,000 again, currently trading at $90,150. However, Monday was not gloomy for all BTC ETF issuers. BlackRock proved its resilience and dominance as its IBIT attracted $28.76 million in inflows. While funds like Graycale’s GBT (-44.03M) and Fidelity’s FBTC (-39.44M) saw substantial withdrawals on December 8, IBIT’s steadiness indicates that profit taking, not a shift in interest, likely triggered the mixed flows into Bitcoin. While Bitcoin bled on December 8, Ethereum exchange-traded funds turned positive with $35.5 million inflows. Notably, the funds recorded substantial exits in the previous two sessions, on December 4 (-41.5M) and December 5 (-75.2M). Indeed, Ethereum has been on the investor radar lately following its Fusaka upgrade, which targets enhanced speed, scalability, and lower costs for Ether-based Layer 2 platforms. Moreover, the inflows indicate that investors are viewing Ethereum as a legitimate token for portfolio diversification beyond Bitcoin. Indeed, the second-largest crypto by value is experiencing renewed interest from institutional participants. For example, BlackRock is seeking the SEC’s authorization for a new staked Ether trust ETF – the ETHB. The proposed product differs from BlackRock’s popular ETHA trust in that the staking Ether trust will track Ethereum’s performance and include incentives gained from the trust’s staked Ether. ETH is trading at $3,124 after gaining more than 10% the past seven days. Solana spot products closed the previous day with $1.2 million inflows. While the figure remains modest, it reflects consistent demand for SOL ETFs. Monday’s inflows have extended their winning streak to three days, demonstrating appetite for these products despite broader turmoil. Solana exchange-traded funds have attracted roughly $639 million since their late October debut. Meanwhile, SOL price is hovering at $133, down 2% the past 24 hours. Ripple’s crypto asset stood out on December 8, with a net inflow of $38.04 million, eclipsing peers for the day. Grayscale led as its GXRP drew over $810K in fresh capital on Monday. Also, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin’s XRP exchange-traded funds recorded notable daily gains. Regulatory clarity and XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions have elevated the altcoin’s appeal among institutional investors. Nevertheless, the December 8 ETF performance sends a clear message. Investors are now diversifying into other cryptos beyond Bitcoin. Altcoin ETFs are gaining traction for their added advantages, as the crypto industry gains increased acceptance in mainstream finance.

Title: All Eyes On Ethereum: Price Attempts Key Breakout As BlackRock Files For Staked ETH ETF

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After weeks of speculation, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially filed for a staked Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid the bullish news, the King of Altcoins’ price is attempting to break out of a two-month resistance, which could set the stage for a retest of higher levels. BlackRock has submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC to get approval for its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), which “seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether and rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether, to the extent the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Trust may do so without incurring undue legal or regulatory risk.” Filed on December 5, BlackRock’s registration statement explains that, if approved, the proposed fund aims to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, distributing staking rewards to stakeholders at least quarterly. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s ETH holdings, the filing noted, while Anchorage Digital Bank will be an available alternative custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings and the administrator of the Trust. Notably, BlackRock’s ETHB will operate separately from its spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is the largest in its category with $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). It’s worth noting that the crypto community began speculating about BlackRock’s upcoming staked ETH fund after the leading asset manager registered the name in Delaware last month. In a November report, 10x Research argued that the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock would bring “increased scrutiny” to “the economics of DATs” as retail investors would reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. The report added that many investors are unaware that Digital Asset Treasury (DATs)’s embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Ethereum’s price started the week attempting to reclaim a crucial area after managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite the volatility during the weekend. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 3% in the daily timeframe, hitting $3,180 before retracing on Monday. Amid this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that “it’s time to pay attention to ETH,” noting that it nears a key level that could push the price to higher zones. Per the chart, Ethereum briefly broke out of its two-month downtrend line, which has served as resistance since early October. Over this period, the King of Altcoins has attempted to break out of this level twice, but has ultimately been rejected during each attempt. On Monday morning, ETH briefly broke above the trendline before being rejected a third time. However, if Ethereum reclaims the $3,120-$3,130 levels and turns the downtrend into support, it could build the base for a retest of the $3,200-$3,300 horizontal levels, which marks the lower boundary of its Q3 and early Q4 price range. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) continues to move within its macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. He previously affirmed that if “ETHDOM can maintain itself above 10.05% then it should be positioned for higher market dominance levels over time.” The analyst added that although history suggests a potential 2.5% drop to the consolidation range lows, this dip would occur “in the context of a macro move to 18%-20%” in the future. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,114, a 13.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Slide As ETF Era Rewires Market Participation — Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has shown a sharp slowdown since spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched. While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Tether deepens AI bet, backs Italian firm’s humanoid robots

Time Published: 2025-12-09T04:41:34Z

The funding will support the development of humanoid robots for industrial use, aiming for “industrial scale performance.” Stablecoin giant Tether has announced it is one of the backers of an $81 million funding round for an Italian artificial intelligence startup aiming to build advanced humanoid robots. The 70 million euro funding round for startup Generative Bionics was led by the AI fund of CDP Venture Capital, with participation from Tether, AMD Ventures, Duferco, Eni Next and RoboIT. In an announcement on Monday, Tether said it provided capital to support the development of advanced humanoid robots, “built for industrial scale performance” and “human-centric interaction.” “Tether’s investment will support the development of Physical AI systems and edge AI solutions, and accelerate the industrial validation of the company’s humanoid platform, the development of its first production facility, and its integration in the broader robotics ecosystem,” Tether said. Generative Bionics is an AI startup and research spinoff from the Italian Institute of Technology. Its focus is on building humanoid robots with “real-world physical AI capabilities” such as industrial usability in factory production lines. “Tether’s support for Generative Bionics builds on its broader strategy to back emerging technologies that expand human potential while reducing reliance on centralized systems overseen by Big Tech,” Tether said. Related: Tether's USDt awarded key regulatory status in Abu Dhabi According to Tether, the firm focuses on five areas of investment. These include: finance, power, data, education and evolution, with AI investments such as these falling under the category of evolution. With a healthy balance sheet in 2025, the firm has made a series of investments across multiple sectors. In terms of AI, it was reported in mid-November that the firm was considering a hefty $1.15 billion investment in German AI robotics startup Neura. In the announcement, Tether also highlighted some other AI plays it has supported. “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development,” Tether said.

The indices had opened sharply lower at 84,742.87 and 25,754.90 respectively, weighed down by weak global cues and caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision later this week. Market breadth showed a divergent picture with advances outnumbering declines 2,307 to 1,671 among 4,172 stocks traded on the BSE. However, sectoral performance remained mixed as Nifty Financial Services fell 0.44 per cent to 27,563.95 and Nifty Bank slipped 0.06 per cent to 59,204.05, while Nifty Midcap 100 edged up 0.03 per cent and Nifty Smallcap 100 gained 0.58 per cent. Some stocks from the Nifty index traded in positive territory, led by Titan Company, which surged 2.33 per cent to ₹3,854.90, followed by Eveready Industries at 1.24 per cent to ₹288.80, Shriram Finance at 1.16 per cent to ₹843.90, Adani Enterprises at 1.07 per cent to ₹2,240, and Grasim Industries at 0.76 per cent to ₹2,765.

Market participants remained cautious as the Indian rupee continued to trade past the 90 mark against the dollar amid persistent dollar strength. Fresh concerns emerged from U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments threatening additional tariffs on rice imports from India, adding to the risk-off sentiment. Technical analysts noted that Nifty’s immediate resistance was placed at 25,950-26,000, while support stood at 25,800. The day’s session saw 54 stocks hitting 52-week highs against 483 stocks touching 52-week lows. Additionally, 130 stocks hit upper circuit limits while 142 touched lower circuits, reflecting the volatile trading conditions as investors awaited further global cues.

Bengaluru, India, 9th December 2025 - According to Zerodha Fund House, digital only passive fund house in the country, in its recent study cited that total Gold ETF AUM in India has crossed ₹1L crore as of Oct 2025. This surge, matched by a spike in new investor accounts, shows that the ETF route is becoming the preferred choice for Indian gold investors since Gold also plays a key role as a strategic long-term investment and as a foundational allocation in a well-diversified portfolio.

The resignation has been accepted, and his last working day with the Company will be December 31, 2025. Gold and silver prices are stable, supported by risk aversion and anticipation of a 25bp rate drop by the Federal Reserve at its meeting on December 9-10. With the Fed generally expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, traders will be watching the latest economic predictions (the Dot plot) and comments from Chair Jerome Powell for signals on the central bank’s plans for 2026 and beyond. Current market pricing indicates a 90% chance of such a move, with expectations now pointing to two additional cuts next year, down from three only a week ago. The market may be anticipating that the Fed may signal that, after this rate cut, there may be a halt in the first quarter of 2026 for a few months. Technical Triggers\u0009 Gold has started its upward journey again; the next target is $4300 (~Rs 132,000) and $4345 (~Rs 133,500) with strong support at $4200 (~Rs 129,000). Silver can continue its rally towards $60 (~Rs 185,500) and $62 (~Rs 191,000), with firm support at $57 (~Rs 177,000), if tight supply conditions continue. “Bitcoin slid slightly and is holding near the $90,000 zone, but the market tone remains cautious as liquidity has thinned and participation has noticeably faded into year-end. Multiple desks highlight the same issue: spot demand is soft, ETF flows are still negative, and futures activity has reset to much lower levels. With more than seven million BTC now sitting at an unrealized loss and hedging costs elevated, the market is signalling reluctance to chase upside until visibility improves. Even short-lived rallies toward $92,000 are meeting resistance as pro traders remain defensive and continue paying up for downside protection. For now, BTC looks pinned in a narrow range, with the buy-side backdrop too light to sustain a clean breakout. Macro remains the dominant driver, and traders are approaching the Fed meeting with a fully priced-in 25 bps cut. The divergence in global policy signals (the BOJ’s tightening stance, a divided BOE, and a steady ECB) has added another layer of complexity. Soft U.S. labour data, weak housing indicators, and anxiety around AI-linked equity valuations are encouraging a more risk-averse tone across assets. Rising long-bond yields and China’s stablecoin discount point to broader caution rather than overt stress. Against this backdrop, the clearest market consensus is that direction will hinge more on Fed chair Powell’s messaging than the rate move itself. This is especially so with traders expecting a shallow easing path rather than a full cycle. Altcoins continue to trade unevenly but are showing pockets of relative strength as Bitcoin consolidates. Ethereum has held up better and is aided by improving flows and structural catalysts. It is trading near its strongest level versus BTC in over a month. XRP and Cardano are benefiting from rotational flows, while others remain pressured by weak liquidity and lingering regulatory noise. Zcash continued its climb as the token surged by 16%. If Bitcoin remains range-bound after the Fed, the environment may favour continued selective outperformance in altcoins rather than a broad rally. Still, without a pickup in market participation or clearer macro signals, sustained momentum across the altcoin complex is likely to remain sporadic and catalyst-driven. Our advice: For customers, the practical stance is to build positions gradually only near strong support. Keep leverage light and wait for a clear break above $92,000-$94,000 before expecting sustained upside.” IndiGo flights cancellation, IndiGo stocks & share price today live updates: IndiGo has signaled a recovery from its recent crisis on Monday, announcing it will operate more than 1,800 flights across its network even as government officials intensify on-ground inspections at major airports.

Edmonton Police Service (EPS) has kicked off a pilot project of AI-powered body cameras. From last Wednesday through the end of December, officers will wear the equipment from Arizona-based Axon Enterprise. The cameras will leverage facial recognition software to search for matches in a pre-loaded database. EPS says this database contains the facial data of about 7,000 people who have been flagged as a safety risk due to outstanding warrants for violent crimes, including robbery, aggravated assault and murder. How it works is the bodycam will scan faces of people within four metres of the officer and send this data to the cloud to compare against the EPC database. If the individual in question isn’t a person of interest, the data will be discard. Potential matches, meanwhile, will be sent for review by a trained professional within 24 hours. EPS believes this technology will make policing safer and faster. It also says similar facial recognition technology is already being used to identify faces in security footage. It should also be noted that the Government of Alberta mandated in 2023 that all officers in the province wear body cams. However, these AI-powered bodycams are already drawing scrutiny. For one, some have pointed out that this technology can have biases related to race, gender and age. Diane McLeod, the information and privacy commissioner of Alberta, also told CTV News Edmonton that she’s concerned about both these biases and the EPS maintaining the privacy of Canadians as outlined in the Protection of Privacy Act. It remains to be seen what may come out of this pilot once it wraps at the end of the month. EPS says it will review the results in the new year before deciding how to move forward.

Title: Nomura Sends Bankers to New York, London in Asset Manager Push

(Bloomberg) -- Nomura Asset Management Co. plans to relocate dozens of staff from its Tokyo headquarters to offices in cities such as London and New York to develop its homegrown talent for investment and sales operations. More staff with overseas business experience will boost Nomura’s stance as a global competitor in asset management, President Hiroyasu Koike said in an interview. “Unless we enhance our global investment capabilities, we will lose our reason for being,” he said, adding that he’s still considering specific locations for the staff. “We want to proactively send trainees and transfer staff to greatly strengthen the development of global talent.” Japan’s main finance regulator this year revealed how many domestic asset managers often lag behind overseas rivals due to a narrower product offering that is harming the country’s competitiveness as one of the world’s key financial centers. Reform of tax-free accounts under the Nippon Individual Savings Account scheme is helping to draw more people into investing in a nation traditionally more focused on lower-return savings. Nomura Asset Management currently has about 30 employees stationed abroad and Koike said he intends to significantly boost that figure, without specifying more detail. Potential destinations include existing offices in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other destinations where parent Nomura Holdings Inc. recently acquired some public asset management businesses from Macquarie Group Ltd. in the US and Europe. As of the end of September, Nomura Asset Management oversaw around ¥99.7 trillion ($643 billion). That’s still a sliver compared to global giants like BlackRock Inc., which managed $11.6 trillion as of December 2024. Koike said Nomura’s purchase of the Macquarie assets offers “a chance to grow into a transformed asset management company in five or ten years.” It’s also being considered as a destination for trainee assignments. Previously, Nomura had sent four trainees to American Century Investments, a major US asset manager in which it holds a stake. “I want to acclimatize staff to an environment where they conduct daily business operations in English,” Koike said. “Then, when they return to Japan, it would be ideal if they can leverage that network and what they’ve learned to become future talent capable of engaging in global operations and global management.” --With assistance from Russell Ward.

Title: Robinhood launches staking for Ethereum and Solana in ongoing crypto expansion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/08/robinhood-launches-staking-for-ethereum-and-solana-in-ongoing-crypto-expansion/

Robinhood is doubling down on crypto offerings. The trading app will launch staking for Ethereum and Solana in New York starting on Tuesday, according to the company, allowing customers to earn yield on cryptocurrency. The company will let customers stake in New York and plans to expand across the country. “We’re proud of the momentum we’ve seen with staking and especially excited that staking is now available to customers in New York, which has one of the most rigorous regulatory frameworks in the country,” wrote Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, in a note to Fortune. Staking has been part of the crypto universe for nearly a decade, rewarding users who lock up a stash of tokens in order to help operate a blockchain network. But uncertainty over its legal status has meant it has been mostly experienced crypto users who have engaged in it using their own wallets. In 2023, the exchange Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that it broke the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules by offering staking. Robinhood’s launching of crypto stakes reflects a looser regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. “These crypto enhancements are strategic chess moves positioning Robinhood for the anticipated transformation of financial infrastructure through blockchain technology and tokenization—particularly with the regulatory clarity we expect under the current administration,” said Caydee Blankenship, senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research. Robinhood also announced a push into global crypto markets. In Europe, it will add perpetual futures contracts on several coins, and it will also enter the Indonesian market, as it agreed to buy a brokerage and crypto platform in the country. Robinhood is not new to crypto, as users on the platform have been able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2018. However, the company has beefed up its crypto arm this year. In June, Robinhood completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running crypto exchange. Crypto transactions accounted for more than 21% of the company’s revenue, as of last month’s earnings report. Robinhood’s expansion of its digital assets could help it challenge other crypto exchanges, according to Romeo Alvarez, research analyst at William O’Neil. “Robinhood is stepping up its efforts to compete on a global basis with larger trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Kraken,” he said. The past few days have seen other big banks vie for staking. On Friday, BlackRock filed for a stake Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB). The Wall Street giant already has an Ethereum ETF (ETHA), but that one does not have staking components.

Title: Crypto, TradFi sentiment improves: Will Bitcoin traders clear shorts above $93K?

Improving retail crypto and TradFi investor sentiment align with a recent uptick in Bitcoin price, but sell orders and short positions in the $93,000 range threaten to cap the rally. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin price repeatedly revisited the $90,000 range as retail investor sentiment improved, fund managers restated their bullish expectations for a potential end-of-year rally, and Strategy announced a sizable (BTC) purchase. According to VanEck head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Bernstein’s comments follow BlackRock chair and CEO Larry Fink mentioning that sovereign wealth funds are “incrementally” buying Bitcoin as it “has fallen from its $126,000 peak.” Fink said, Mirroring Fink’s and Bernstein’s view, on Monday, Strategy announced a fresh 10,624 BTC ($962.7 million) purchase at an average $90,615 per coin. Bitwise European head of research Andre Dragosch noted that Strategy’s purchase “was the biggest amount since July 2025.” While Bitcoin’s recovery from its Nov. 21 low of $80,612 has followed the improvement in investor sentiment, the price is still capped in the $90,000 to $93,000 range. On Saturday, chartered market technician Aksel Kibar said, Related: Did BTC's Santa rally start at $89K? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week Cumulative volume data from Hyblock provides a more nuanced view, highlighting rising participation from investors in the 0 to 100 BTC trade cohort, which some analysts label as retail. Larger trade-size cohorts in the 1,000 to 100,000 and 100,000 to 1 million (cumulative volume delta) appear to be selling on rallies in the $90,000 to $93,000 price range. Similarly, order book data for BTC/USDT (perpetual contracts at Binance) shows a wall of asks starting at $90,000 and thickening from $94,000 to $95,000. Liquidation heatmap data, on the other hand, shows short liquidity at $94,000 to $95,300, which could serve as fuel for bulls to attempt a run on $100,000 if the market provides sufficient catalysts to induce an uptick in either spot or futures buying.

Title: ‘Justice was done,’ says Willow Park abuse survivor after ex-teacher Peter Kelly jailed for 10 years
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/12/08/justice-was-done-says-willow-park-abuse-survivor-after-ex-teacher-peter-kelly-jailed-for-10-years/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T21:36:41Z

“The process was brutal but justice was done,” said one man who was abused as a child by teacher Peter Kelly at Willow Park primary school in Dublin’s Blackrock. Kelly (73) was sentenced to a total of 10 years imprisonment at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Monday for the sexual abuse of eight boys at the school in the early to mid-1980s. The trial took place in camera but a number Kelly’s abuse survivors spoke to The Irish Times afterwards. Some did not want their names used. Matthew (not his real name), first made allegations about Kelly 25 years ago, in 2000, to the Willow Park school authorities. This led to Kelly’s resignation in 2004. “They fought me and fought me and fought me and fought me. I’m the original complainant,” he said. “If they had afforded me 1 per cent of the protection that they had afforded him, this would have come out many years ago,” he said. A Garda file on Matthew’s allegations against Kelly was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who decided not to prosecute Kelly. “I left the country. I took that as not being believed,” he said. Kelly was sentenced to five years jail on Monday arising from the allegations made by Matthew. In his victim-impact statement to the court on December 2nd, Matthew recalled how, in order to escape abuse by Kelly at Willow Park, he steered his bicycle into a lamp-post. “At 11 years of age I never stood a chance,” he told the court. “I hated everything to do with school.” These days he is “putting one foot in front of the other. I’m not coping, I’m here,” he told The Irish Times. Aidan Moore, who agreed to be named, felt 10 years was “a fair sentence” for Kelly. “I can’t say I’m happy, because it’s not a happy day but Justice [Elma] Sheahan has given a fair sentence in regard to what the charges were and I am very comfortable with what the sentence is,” he said. Mr Moore has spent most of his life abroad, mainly because of his abuse at Willow Park. “I really feel that I can’t stay here. I spent a number of years in the United States and spent over 20 years in Africa, in Kenya. I’m back here for family reasons but I’m really struggling,” he said. Five of the eight men who made complaints against Kelly also alleged abuse by former Christian Brother Edward Baylor, now deceased. He was referred to by Justice Elma Sheahan in her sentencing judgement as “EB”. He was convicted of child abuse in 1988. Mr Moore said he had been abused by Baylor. “It is clear that the Holy Ghost Fathers/Spiritans enabled, protected and covered up for their abusers. That is one of the reasons why it has taken so long to get to where we are today, the conviction of one paedophile for 28 charges out of the thousands of crimes committed.” It also “required a lot of courage from the victims and their families, and an enormous amount of work by An Garda Síochána and the DPP has gone into achieving this result,” he said. Kieran Freeney said of the case he was “happy that it’s concluded and that we can all move on from this because it’s been over 30 years in the making”. When his mother died by suicide, and with his father living abroad for work reasons, Kieran became a boarder at Willow Park, where he was abused by both Kelly and Baylor at the ages of 11 and 12. Kelly was “the only one that’s alive so, unfortunately for him perhaps, but fortunately for us that we get some closure in our lives and some part of justice being served on behalf of myself and of my colleagues here today and all victims of Blackrock and Willow Park,” he said. For Luke (not his real name), Kelly’s sentence was “in line with what I was hoping for. I think that’s fair.” His own decision to come forward with his allegations followed the RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys in 2022. “I was living in Germany at the time and I came forward. My brother, who is 12 years older than me, was also abused in the school. He has come forward.” As with many survivors, he had high praise for the gardaí involved who did “a fantastic job, especially Rachel Kilpatrick, Aisling Healy and the team”. Overall “the process was brutal but justice was done. It’s OK for people to come forward. There is help out there and the police have a very much victim-led approach. So I urge people to come forward. It’s better out than in,” he said.

December 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the Neutron launch vehicle’s innovative “Hungry Hippo” captive fairing has successfully completed qualification testing and is enroute to Virginia for Neutron’s first launch. Dubbed the Hungry Hippo, Neutron’s fairing halves remain attached to the rocket’s first stage throughout launch and landing back to Earth – a world-first for a reusable commercial rocket. Whereas typical rockets’ fairing halves fall away during launch and are disposable or require collection at sea for reuse, Neutron’s fairing halves open to release the rocket’s second stage and mission payload before closing again to return Neutron to Earth as a single reusable vehicle – enabling rapid and cost-effective reuse and streamlining operations for a high-cadence launch service for commercial, civil, and national security missions. The qualification is a key moment in the development of the reusable Neutron rocket, the world’s largest carbon composite launch vehicle with a lift capacity of up to 13,000kg (33,000 pounds). With the design, structure, and operations of Neutron’s innovative fairing now qualified for flight, Hungry Hippo is enroute to Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia ahead of Neutron’s first launch. Development of Neutron began in late 2021 and with the first launch scheduled for liftoff in 2026, it remains on track to be one of the fastest commercially developed rockets in history. Rocket Lab Vice President – Neutron, Shaun D’Mello, says: “A rocket like Neutron has never been built before, and we’re doing it at a pace and price point that’s going to bring the innovation and competition needed in today’s industry. Building, qualifying, and shipping Hungry Hippo is a fantastic marker of progress toward Neutron’s first launch, and I’m proud of the team for their attention to detail and pulling off this significant milestone.” Hungry Hippo Qualification ProgramTo qualify the Hungry Hippo fairing for Neutron’s first launch, Rocket Lab completed an intensive qualification and acceptance testing campaign that validated the structure’s expected performance during the intense aerodynamic pressure of launch and re-entry featuring full-scale tests as well as a series of sub-component tests. Tests have included (but are not limited to): Once Hungry Hippo arrives in Virginia, the fairing structure will be integrated to Neutron’s first stage in final flight configuration to undergo pre-launch testing, including static fires and a Wet Dress Rehearsal, at Launch Complex 3 ahead of first launch.

December 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives. “With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year. “We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters. “As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels. Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis. Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year. Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

"She missed you" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been more than seven years since Shadow of the Tomb Raider put a bow on Lara Croft's big reboot trilogy, and since then, series fans have been desperate for even a morsel of information on what's coming next. Now, finally, it seems relief is in sight, as a big Tomb Raider reveal has been teased for The Game Awards later this week. "Did you miss her?" the official Tomb Raider account asks on Twitter. "She missed you." The message encourages you to tune into the annual TGA showcase on December 11 "for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises." The news was initially revealed in Fortnite, as part of a TGA-branded island built for players to vote on their favorite fanmade creations in the battle royale hub. The teaser includes an image showing a silhouette of Lara Croft posing proudly with the old-school dual pistols that helped define her appearance in the original 1996 game. If you squint just hard enough, you can just about make out pouches and holster straps around her legs that hint at the old costume, too. Did you miss her? She missed you. 🔫As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider#TombRaider #Fortnite #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/IiN3jPQSkSDecember 8, 2025 It's possible that this reveal is tied to some non-gaming multimedia project, like maybe the upcoming Prime Video series, but I'm inclined to believe it's going to be our first look at the new Tomb Raider game Crystal Dynamics first announced way back in 2022. You don't tease "future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises" without knowing that fans are going to expect a video game reveal. The most telling bit is the new-look Lara. As far back as 2021, Crystal Dynamics was talking about its intent to "unify" the old-school Tomb Raider timeline with the modern Survivor trilogy, and we've occasionally seen new versions of the character blending '90s camp costuming with a more realistic appearance for the character herself. The idea of a "unified" Lara Croft design has grown powerful in the minds of fans, and this new teaser certainly seems to suggest something along those lines. For now, we have only two concrete bits of information on the new Tomb Raider game: it's being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and it's going to be published by Amazon Games. For a couple of years now, it's seemed that Crystal Dynamics only emerges from its silence to announce another round of layoffs before going quiet once again. Here's hoping this reveal at The Game Awards turns out to be a little more unequivocally positive. These are the best Tomb Raider games ever made.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher has been jailed for 10 years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests. Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Sentencing Kelly today, Judge Elma Sheahan said she was struck by the bravery of these men who she said “bared their souls” and noted the “eloquent expression of their very real hurt and torment”. She said the injuries suffered included psychiatric issues, addiction and also the inter-generational hurt in the sense that the children and partners of these men have suffered too. Judge Sheahan said the men had waited for decades for their stories to be heard and believed and referred to the fact that during their childhood and adolescence, many could not explain their reasons for withdrawing from their families, their inability to attend school and their various addictions. She said that the worry and upset caused to those close to the victims is more evidence of the damage done by Kelly. Judge Sheahan noted that many of the victims had already suffered very real or significant trauma including the loss or death of parents before she added that a number of the victims had previously been sexually abused by another teacher at the school. She said as such, these victims were “already vulnerable children”. The judge took into account “the gruelling nature” of the trial for the victims while accepting that Kelly was entitled to “call on the State to prove the case against him”. Judge Sheahan said the aggravating features of the case were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused in the lives of the victims, the breach of trust, the age disparity, the repetitive nature of the offending, the number of complainants, the vulnerability of the victims both due to their age and their own personal circumstances as well as the fact that some of the abuse took place in front of their peers. Judge Sheahan said that in mitigation she accepted that Kelly has no previous convictions and is a frail man with many medical conditions, noting that Kelly requires ongoing oncology appointments for treatment for prostate cancer. She said he has lost the single greatest mitigation of a plea of guilty before acknowledging that he does not accept the verdict of the jury. She set various different sentences for each of the offences in relation to each of the victims, ranging from 20 months to five years, before she imposed a global consecutive sentence of 10 years. Judge Sheahan said “given the lack of acceptance on the part of the accused of the verdict, the court does not feel there is any evidential basis on which to suspend any of the sentence”. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” Judge Sheahan said. Earlier, Judge Sheahan was advised that two members of the jury panel were present in the courtroom for the sentence hearing. She said given that the case was to be heard in camera and not open to the public, those members of the jury should not be in court. “The court is always careful to be very thankful to the members of the jury for the work they have done and what they have sat through – the letter of the law would require that strictly speaking as they are no longer members of the jury they should not be in court,” Judge Sheahan said, adding “this is in no way to disregard the work they had done”. At an earlier sentence hearing last week, Judge Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Advertisement Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of times in their lives when they have struggled with thoughts of suicide. They spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made to “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Inspector Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told Judge Sheahan that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Mr Sexton told the court. Judge Sheahan said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Title: BlackRock Seeks SEC Nod To Launch Staked Ethereum ETF
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-seeks-sec-nod-to-launch-staked-ethereum-etf/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T20:32:44Z
Full Content:
In a bold push into on-chain yield exposure, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially applied to list and trade shares of an investment vehicle tied to a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday for its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to investors. The S-1 is part of the SEC’s process for issuers to introduce investment vehicles like ETFs, but does not guarantee approval, and the fund’s listing exchange must still file a separate 19b-4 form. The filing comes a couple of weeks after BlackRock filed a name registration with the state of Delaware for the staking Ethereum trust ETF, signaling intent to file with the SEC soon. Unlike BlackRock’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF, which the company intends to list and trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker ETHB, will track the performance of Ether and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the S-1 reads. BlackRock had previously sought the SEC’s sign-off to add a staking component to ETHA. Though the Commission had acknowledged applications as early as July, it continued to delay a formal decision. Notably, Grayscale Investments has already added a staking functionality to its previously greenlighted spot ETH and mini ETH trusts following the approval of new generic listing standards for commodity trusts, as the SEC’s stance has shifted under new Chairman Paul Atkins. However, BlackRock has decided to launch a completely new fund while others modify their existing vehicles. ETHA remains the largest of its kind with around $16 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, BlackRock manages the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT).

Shares of CoreWeave (CRWV) lost ground Monday after the cloud computing company said it would sell $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The shares were down close to 5% in recent trading. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The data center provider backed by AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said the convertible senior notes coming due in 2031 will be made in a private offering, and initial investors would have the option to purchase an additional $300 million worth within a 13-day period from the issuance date. Convertible debt offerings can offer a relatively simple and inexpensive way for companies to raise capital. However, existing shareholders may view them negatively, as they can be dilutive and may raise concerns about a company's debt levels. CoreWeave said that a portion of the proceeds will be used for capped call transactions, with the rest for general corporate purposes. The move comes after a recent pullback in CoreWeave's shares amid worries about an AI bubble, after a big run-up in its stock following its public debut in March. Even with CoreWeave's recent losses, the stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price.

Unlike the firm’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF will track the performance of Ethereum and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the filing reads. The firm’s S-1 registration filing follows the November formation of the Delaware statutory trust, an act that typically precedes the ETF filing for crypto and commodity products. Previously, BlackRock had sought approval to add a staking component to its spot Ethereum ETF, ETHA. While the SEC had acknowledged requests as early as July, it continued to push back a formal decision, last delaying a decision in early September. It’s unclear how ETHB’s filing will affect any plans for staking additions to ETHA. A representative for BlackRock told Decrypt the firm could not comment on its ETHB ETF filing at present time. Ethereum staking ETFs hit the market following the creation of generic listing standards for commodity trusts. Grayscale’s ETHE was first to market in early October, followed by the REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF. But so far, they haven’t eaten into the success of BlackRock’s existing spot ETF. ETHA has more than $11 billion in funds under management, or around 3.6 million ETH, compared to less than $5 billion (or 1.8 million ETH) for Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH Mini Trust ETFs combined. BlackRock’s ETF success is also apparent in the Bitcoin market, highlighted by its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which is the largest crypto ETF on the market with around $70 billion in assets under management. IBIT is up around 1% on Monday as Bitcoin has fallen 1% in the last 24 hours to trade at $90,390. ETHA has jumped more than 3% as Ethereum is roughly flat, changing hands at $3,122. When approved, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB) is expected to trade alongside BlackRock’s other ETFs on the Nasdaq exchange.

Title: IBM To Buy Confluent For $9.3 Billion To Expand AI Services
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ibm-to-buy-confluent-for-93-billion-to-expand-ai-services
Time Published: 2025-12-08T17:25:10Z
Full Content:
International Business Machines Corp. is buying the data-streaming platform Confluent Inc. for about $9.3 billion, marking one of its largest takeovers yet and a major bet on the kind of enterprise software that artificial intelligence tools need to perform tasks in real time. IBM will pay $31 a share, according to a statement issued Monday. The enterprise value, which includes debt, is $11 billion, it said. The companies expect the deal to close by the middle of 2026. If the transaction fails or is terminated, IBM will pay Confluent a breakup fee of $453.6 million, according to an accompanying regulatory filing. The acquisition “could significantly improve IBM’s AI portfolio, and subsequently its software unit’s sales growth,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard wrote Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the deal talks. Confluent shares rose as much as 29% to $29.86 after markets opened in New York, more than a dollar below the offer price. IBM shares rose as much as 2.4%. The AI boom has touched off billions of dollars in deals for businesses that build, train or leverage the technology, propelling the value of an entire ecosystem of data center developers, software makers, generative AI tool developers and data management firms. Mountain View, California-based Confluent sits in the data corner of that world, providing a platform for companies to gather — or “stream” — and analyze data in real time as opposed to shipping data in clunkier batches. Manufacturers such as Michelin, for example, have used Confluent’s platform to optimize their inventories of raw and semi-finished materials live. Instacart adopted Confluent to develop real-time fraud detection systems and gain more visibility into the availability of products sold on its grocery delivery platform. Businesses are increasingly tapping AI systems that manage tasks like this in real-time and require live flows of data to do so. IBM, which pioneered mainframe computers, has been trying to reposition its business around AI over the past few years. Under Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, it’s been buying software companies and selling generative AI-related services to enterprise clients. Software now makes up almost half its total revenue and continues to grow at a steady rate. The Confluent acquisition would be IBM’s biggest since it bought cloud software firm Red Hat for about $34 billion in 2019. Confluent’s takeover stands apart from the multibillion-dollar deals that have dominated the AI space in recent months, largely focused on data centers and the computing power necessary to build and power AI systems themselves. Soaring demand for such capacity has fueled massive transactions, including BlackRock Inc.’s $40 billion purchase of Aligned Data Centers and Oracle Corp.’s agreement to supply OpenAI with about 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, worth as much as $300 billion. Confluent was started in 2014 by a trio of founders who came from LinkedIn, including the company’s current chief executive officer, Jay Kreps. The firm’s shares had fallen 17% this year before news of the deal. The stock is far below its intraday peak of $94.97 a share in November 2021, following the company’s initial public offering. Barclays Plc, Centerview Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised IBM, while Morgan Stanley advised Confluent, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the matter is private. The banks each declined to comment. The acquisition builds on a five-year partnership between the two firms, which allowed some IBM customers to use Confluent’s data-streaming platform. IBM completed its $6.4 billion purchase of HashiCorp Inc. in February and recently considered buying Informatica Inc., another infrastructure-focused vendor that was ultimately acquired by Salesforce Inc.

Title: Survivors of abuser Kelly tell of 'unimaginable trauma'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1208/1547921-peter-kelly-reaction/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T17:18:13Z
Full Content:
Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent Most of those abused by Peter Kelly as young boys were in court to see him jailed. They stood in silence watching as he was led by prison officers back to the cells in the Criminal Courts. Many broke down afterwards, hugging friends and family members. The former maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock, a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin, was jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Kieran Freeney, whose mother had died shortly before the abuse began said afterwards that he was happy with the sentence as it would give him closure in his lifetime. He said two other predators who had abused children in Willow Park school were now deceased. And he said he was relieved for the other men present in court as well as all victims alive and dead. He said his message to them was that "we got one, and we managed to put him away". Mr Freeney said Kelly should be serving life, but he knew that at his age, ten years would be horrific. He said he hoped he would use his time to reflect on the lives he had damaged. Aidan Moore was seriously abused by another teacher at the school, Edward Baylor, who is now dead. Judge Elma Sheahan said he and a number of other boys, who had also been abused by Baylor, had suffered "unimaginable trauma". Speaking outside court, Mr Moore said today was a victory for all victims of sexual abuse crimes. But he said the fact that the Spiritan order had protected abusers was one of the reasons it had taken so long to get to this point which he said was the conviction of just one paedophile for 28 charges. However, Mr Moore said this victory was not taken lightly and required a lot of courage from victims as well as enormous work by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Moore said he wanted to speak to all victims of sexual abuse especially those struggling. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone. "It is not your shame and it is not your guilt," he said, adding "and you do not have to carry it alone". Mr Moore praised the "incredible courage" of brothers, David and Mark Ryan and their friend Maura Harmon, who revealed the abuse that had been happening in Willow Park and Blackrock College in their groundbreaking documentary "Blackrock Boys", broadcast on RTÉ Radio one in November 2022. He said many men had come forward to tell their stories since. He said others remained silent, and perhaps thought nothing would happen if they spoke up. However, he said today something had been achieved, and a paedophile was "where he belongs, behind bars". Mr Moore said even though these offences happened almost 50 years ago, paedophiles had not gone away. And he believed it was incumbent on every adult to look out for the welfare of children and be proactive in protecting innocent young lives from predatory paedophiles. He said it remained very much a live issue. He said he was standing in front of the courts because if it made a difference in even one person’s life, it would be worth it Mr Moore said the end of the trial and the sentencing was a huge relief and he had not expected the sentence to be as long as it was. He said it had been a very painful process to go through for all victims. He said he hoped other people would come forward so the extent of the abuse at the two schools would be known. Mr Moore also criticised the length of time being taken by the Spiritan order to set up a redress scheme. He said he had gone through an extremely painful settlement process and hoped other people would be able to avoid this. Mr Moore said he would never get over this. He said the effect of child sexual abuse was evident every day. He said it affected his wife, children and everyone who knew him. Spiritan Province 'deeply sorry' for harm In a statement this afternoon, the Spiritan Province said it was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by Peter Kelly while he was a teacher at Willow Park School. The statement said their thoughts were with those who were abused as children by Kelly, and with their loved ones. And they said they hoped the court's verdict and the sentence passed today brought them some measure of validation and justice. The Spiritans said they offered them the same sincere apology that they extended to all who suffered abuse in their schools. The order said it had begun a Restorative Justice process for victims and survivors, and encouraged anyone affected to come forward. It said support was available through the Restore Together Group, the Restorative Justice Team and its services, and the Spiritan Safeguarding Office. Those affected have strongly criticised the amount of time taken by the order to put in place a redress scheme for them. In an earlier statement issued in October, the Spiritan Province said they acknowledged the deep pain and frustration suffered by victims and survivors and also acknowledged progress had not been as fast as anyone would wish. It outlined steps being taken to sell properties in order to make resources available for redress payments. Victim impact statements Last week the court heard victim impact statements from a number of the men. The first man to give his statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he did not want Kelly near him, but he could not get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do to make sure Kelly would not notice him so he would not touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he would not have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse had not happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it could not just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. Aidan Moore told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by Edward Baylor. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. He broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Others also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Judge Sheahan said she hoped today’s sentencing would bring them closure. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent Most of those abused by Peter Kelly as young boys were in court to see him jailed. They stood in silence watching as he was led by prison officers back to the cells in the Criminal Courts. Many broke down afterwards, hugging friends and family members. The former maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock, a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin, was jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Kieran Freeney, whose mother had died shortly before the abuse began said afterwards that he was happy with the sentence as it would give him closure in his lifetime. He said two other predators who had abused children in Willow Park school were now deceased. And he said he was relieved for the other men present in court as well as all victims alive and dead. He said his message to them was that "we got one, and we managed to put him away". Mr Freeney said Kelly should be serving life, but he knew that at his age, ten years would be horrific. He said he hoped he would use his time to reflect on the lives he had damaged. Aidan Moore was seriously abused by another teacher at the school, Edward Baylor, who is now dead. Judge Elma Sheahan said he and a number of other boys, who had also been abused by Baylor, had suffered "unimaginable trauma". Speaking outside court, Mr Moore said today was a victory for all victims of sexual abuse crimes. But he said the fact that the Spiritan order had protected abusers was one of the reasons it had taken so long to get to this point which he said was the conviction of just one paedophile for 28 charges. However, Mr Moore said this victory was not taken lightly and required a lot of courage from victims as well as enormous work by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Moore said he wanted to speak to all victims of sexual abuse especially those struggling. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone. "It is not your shame and it is not your guilt," he said, adding "and you do not have to carry it alone". Mr Moore praised the "incredible courage" of brothers, David and Mark Ryan and their friend Maura Harmon, who revealed the abuse that had been happening in Willow Park and Blackrock College in their groundbreaking documentary "Blackrock Boys", broadcast on RTÉ Radio one in November 2022. He said many men had come forward to tell their stories since. He said others remained silent, and perhaps thought nothing would happen if they spoke up. However, he said today something had been achieved, and a paedophile was "where he belongs, behind bars". Mr Moore said even though these offences happened almost 50 years ago, paedophiles had not gone away. And he believed it was incumbent on every adult to look out for the welfare of children and be proactive in protecting innocent young lives from predatory paedophiles. He said it remained very much a live issue. He said he was standing in front of the courts because if it made a difference in even one person’s life, it would be worth it Mr Moore said the end of the trial and the sentencing was a huge relief and he had not expected the sentence to be as long as it was. He said it had been a very painful process to go through for all victims. He said he hoped other people would come forward so the extent of the abuse at the two schools would be known. Mr Moore also criticised the length of time being taken by the Spiritan order to set up a redress scheme. He said he had gone through an extremely painful settlement process and hoped other people would be able to avoid this. Mr Moore said he would never get over this. He said the effect of child sexual abuse was evident every day. He said it affected his wife, children and everyone who knew him. Spiritan Province 'deeply sorry' for harm In a statement this afternoon, the Spiritan Province said it was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by Peter Kelly while he was a teacher at Willow Park School. The statement said their thoughts were with those who were abused as children by Kelly, and with their loved ones. And they said they hoped the court's verdict and the sentence passed today brought them some measure of validation and justice. The Spiritans said they offered them the same sincere apology that they extended to all who suffered abuse in their schools. The order said it had begun a Restorative Justice process for victims and survivors, and encouraged anyone affected to come forward. It said support was available through the Restore Together Group, the Restorative Justice Team and its services, and the Spiritan Safeguarding Office. Those affected have strongly criticised the amount of time taken by the order to put in place a redress scheme for them. In an earlier statement issued in October, the Spiritan Province said they acknowledged the deep pain and frustration suffered by victims and survivors and also acknowledged progress had not been as fast as anyone would wish. It outlined steps being taken to sell properties in order to make resources available for redress payments. Victim impact statements Last week the court heard victim impact statements from a number of the men. The first man to give his statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he did not want Kelly near him, but he could not get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do to make sure Kelly would not notice him so he would not touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he would not have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse had not happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it could not just have been him.

Title: Worker-bee AGI: Why AWS is betting on practical agents, not ‘messiah AGI’

UPDATED 12:04 EST / DECEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert At AWS re:Invent 2025, Amazon Web Services Inc. faced a dual mandate: Speak to millions of longstanding cloud customers while countering a persistent narrative that the company is lagging in artificial intelligence. In our view, AWS chose a distinctly pragmatic path. Rather than chasing the holy grail of what we call “messiah AGI,” or artificial general intelligence or even competing head-on with frontier-scale large language model, the company emphasized foundational agentic scaffolding and customizable large and small language models. This approach aligns with our thesis that the real near-term value in AI lies inside the enterprise – what we see as “worker-bee AGI” – not in aspirational, generalized intelligence. Skeptics argue that this worker-bee AGI is little more than RPA 2.0, burdened by familiar data silos. Though that critique rings somewhat true, we not view AWS’ strategy as merely paving the robotic process automation cow path. Rather, we see the company making a deliberate shift from siloed agentic automation toward what we call “service-as-software” – a new model in which business outcomes, not individual applications, become the primary point of control. In this special edition of Breaking Analysis, we break down AWS re:Invent 2025 through the lens of this emerging paradigm. We’ll examine how AWS is repositioning its infrastructure, services and AI roadmap to support a transformation in the operational, business and technology models of virtually every organization and industry. At re:Invent 2025, one theme kept surfacing in our conversations in that we’re watching two fundamentally different AI models collide. On one side, we see what we call the messiah AGI quest – led by Open AI Labs PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and the frontier labs – pushing ever deeper into the earth in search of more intelligence. On the other side sits the enterprise, represented metaphorically by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and powered by renewable, sustainable data assets that grow stronger with every additional agent deployed. OpenAI and ChatGPT defined the opening chapter of generative AI by tapping a reservoir of free, high-quality internet data. Through GPT-4 and likely GPT-5, the marginal cost of data was essentially zero. Compute was expensive, but the fuel for the models was essentially free. That era is ending, in our view. As freely available high-quality data is depleted, the labs are turning to human expertise – curated reasoning traces from domain specialists – to maintain their performance advantage. We see this as a dramatically different business model. Credible reporting suggests that by 2029 to 2030, OpenAI could be spending 20% to 25% of its revenue just to acquire proprietary expert data. In our view, this is a classic diminishing-returns scenario where you achieve rising marginal costs for increasingly niche improvements. It’s the image of Altman digging deeper into the ground for shrinking seams of coal. Enterprises, by contrast, operate on renewable energy, as shown on the right hand side of the title slide. Their proprietary data grows as they deploy more agents, build more models and instrument more workflows. Every incremental deployment generates more signals, more context, more labeled outcomes. They’re on an experience curve – one that accelerates as data harmonization improves. JPMorgan Chase is the most obvious example, but it represents a much broader pattern. The more enterprises connect their systems of record with their emerging agent ecosystems, the faster their marginal costs fall. This is why we believe the real economic opportunity lies with worker-bee AGI inside the enterprise, not messiah AGI in the labs. The image of windmills and solar farms on our cover slide symbolizes the renewable nature of enterprise data. In the age of AI, algorithms are increasingly commoditized and developed by specialized labs. But shaping data – aligning it with workflows, policies, context and outcomes – is where competitive advantage resides. This brings us to a critical question: Could OpenAI simply partner with leading enterprises to overcome its data disadvantage? In theory, yes. In practice, we see three barriers: In other words, owning a frontier model isn’t enough. To win in the enterprise, the model must be embedded in the workflow to include policy, security, data lineage, context, orchestration, and deterministic logic. This is software, not science, and thus far frontier labs are not enterprise software companies. (Note: Our colleague David Floyer disputes this premise. He believes research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic will build great enterprise software on top of their LLMs and simplify the adoption of enterprise AI. We’ll be digging into and debating this topic with him in future Breaking Analysis episodes.) As a result, the disruption won’t manifest in the technology model alone, rather we’ll see it in the operational and business models of emerging AI software companies – including pricing. The seat-based pricing model that has defined enterprise software for decades will not survive the agentic era, in our view. Infrastructure consumption models will evolve as well. We believe the winners will shift toward value-based/outcome-based pricing aligned with real business results. This is the heart of service-as-software. And AWS – whether intentionally or instinctively – is leaning directly into this shift. It is missing some pieces, however, which we’ll discuss in detail. Let’s park the technology model for a moment and examine the coming changes in the operational and business models of enterprises as a result of AI. As we’ve argued in earlier Breaking Analysis episodes, the shift to AI-driven operations requires a wholesale transformation of how organizations function – not just in their technology stacks, but in their operational and business models. When the industry migrated from on-premises software to software as a service, the burden fell largely on information technology departments and software vendors. Mainstream organizations didn’t have to rethink how their companies worked. This time is different in that the entire organization will change. Practitioners often say the hard part of transformation is people and process, not technology. In the agentic era, all three are hard. The operational model, the business model and the technology model must move in concert, and none of them can remain anchored in legacy assumptions. For six decades – despite new devices, new user interfaces and new software delivery models – the industry continued to build in silos. These were essentially craft cells for knowledge work, each optimized locally because that was the only way we knew how to automate. The shift ahead replaces these craft silos with an end-to-end assembly line for knowledge work. That represents a profound process change. The organizational structures built to make machine-like efficiency possible no longer align with end-to-end outcomes. On the business model side, the shift is equally profound. Traditional software economics were built around nonrecurring engineering or NRE costs. Pricing was often seat-based with added maintenance fees, and steadily improving (and predictable) marginal costs as volume grew. Even in the cloud era, despite variable infrastructure costs, vendors benefited from the same model – upfront NRE, light ongoing maintenance and falling marginal costs as scale increased. AI breaks that pattern. In the new model, organizations deliver outcomes, and pricing will be based on value, usage or direct outcome proxies. More important, the foundation of economic advantage shifts from physical capital and depreciating software assets to digital expertise that compounds. Intelligence becomes capital. The more data that flows through the system, the richer the experience base becomes. Cost advantages and differentiation strengthen simultaneously, creating winner-take-most dynamics. This is where tokens enter the equation. Software companies not only face cloud cost-of-goods-sold, they now incur token costs. Though consumers may benefit from improvements in graphics processing unit price-performance, the marginal economics that once accrued to software vendors increasingly accrue to the organizations that climb the AI learning curve fastest. Getting volume and getting there fast becomes critical; once a company builds compounding advantage through expertise, it becomes extremely difficult for others to catch up. This gets back to the difference between models and agents. The model guys are in this “token grind” where through distillation and advances in the frontier of intelligence, their costs are coming down something like 10 to 30 times per year, some obscene number when it’s just the raw model and the application programming interface. But when it’s an agent and there’s a learning loop in there, their prices are much more stable. And so that gets back to what we’re going to talk about, and where AWS is focused, which is the surrounding scaffolding needed to build, manage and govern agents. The bottom line is the economics of software are being rewritten. Depreciating assets are giving way to compounding expertise, and organizations that build these systems early will gain durable structural advantage. In our view, this shift underpins the emerging service-as-software model – and explains why enterprise AI will look nothing like the transitions of the past. The technology shift unfolding now is far more complex than the move to cloud. The cloud era changed the operational model for running the same application silos – breaking monoliths into microservices but leaving the underlying fragmentation intact. Data remained siloed, and even the application logic itself stayed isolated within domain-specific systems. What is happening now is much different. For decades, enterprises converted data into a corporate asset through the rise of relational databases. That was a significant milestone, but it didn’t unify how businesses reason. In the agentic era, humans and agents need a shared understanding of the rules, processes and semantics that govern the enterprise. That requires constructing a true system of intelligence or SoI – a shared asset that expresses how the business runs. This is something the industry has never done before, and it upends 60 years of accumulated investment in application-centric architectures. Developing a migration path for this transformation is extraordinarily challenging, because every existing enterprise today is built on top of layers of deterministic logic that reflect the constraints of siloed automation. The “Tower of Babel” metaphor on the slide above captures the legacy landscape. Each application has its own language, its own worldview, its own schema. They don’t talk to each other. Even when organizations attempt to consolidate through a lakehouse, the silos reappear inside the lakehouse itself – sales, service, logistics and every other domain carries its own schema, definitions and constraints. Asking cross-functional questions – for example, what happened, why it happened, what should happen next – requires stitching these worlds together with extensive data engineering. This is brittle work, and it reinforces the fragmentation that enterprises are now trying to escape. The move from application-centric silos to a unified, data-centric platform is not simply a technology upgrade. It is a rearchitecture of how intelligence is represented inside the enterprise. And it is this shift that will determine whether organizations can deploy agents that truly understand and drive end-to-end business outcomes. The slide above depicts a dead whale being kicked down the beach – an intentionally stark metaphor for the scale of the challenge ahead. The reference traces back to Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, who once mocked attempts by Lotus and WordPerfect to bolt graphical interfaces onto DOS-era software. He likened that effort to “kicking dead whales down the beach” – an impossible, grinding task weighed down by accumulated legacy code and technical debt. The situation today is exponentially harder. Instead of a single dead whale, the industry faces a thousand. Sixty years of investment in application-centric silos must now be harmonized into a coherent systems of intelligence. Every layer of legacy logic, schema, workflow and domain-specific constraint has to be reconciled. And at this moment, no one vendor has a complete solution for how to do it. The metaphor captures the reality in that preserving compatibility with decades of siloed systems while attempting to build unified, agent-ready architectures is not only difficult – it borders on impossible without rethinking the foundational architecture of the business. The agentic era demands a level of semantic, procedural and data harmonization that legacy architectures were never designed to support. In this next section, we’ll turn to what the broader transformation means for AWS. A series of announcements at re:Invent – general availability milestones, continued investment in Kiro, enhancements across the software development lifecycle, and significant expansions to Nova and Nova Forge – underscore how AWS is positioning itself for the service-as-software era. But before we do that, let’s revisit how we see the emerging technology stack evolving. The slide above depicts the transition from application-centric silos to a data-centric platform. At the base sits the data platform – the logical data estate aggregating information from operational systems, websites and external sources. Vendors such as Snowflake Inc., Databricks, and AWS with its Redshift have done remarkable work consolidating these assets. But consolidation is not the same as harmonization. The data platform remains neither machine-readable nor agent-readable. Even humans often require a business intelligence layer to interpret it. Functionally, these systems provide high-fidelity snapshots of what happened – two-dimensional views constrained by the schemas of each domain. At best, with feature engineering and narrow machine learning, they can forecast what’s likely to happen within a limited scope. What enterprises need next is a true system of intelligence, represented in green on the slide. We’ve discussed previously the need for a four-dimensional, end-to-end map of the business. This is the layer that gives both humans and agents a shared understanding of processes, rules and dependencies. Some organizations attempt to build this today with platforms such as Palantir, but doing so often requires forward-deployed engineers or FDEs crafting bespoke solutions at great expense (~$1 million annually for each FDE). Each customer effectively rebuilds the system from scratch. Above that sits the system of agency, shown in yellow. This is the agent control framework – important for orchestration, policy and workflow activation, but not itself the source of intelligence. It draws meaning from the system of intelligence beneath it. For agents to make decisions with the same contextual awareness humans use today – understanding, for example, how delaying an order for lack of a part could jeopardize a major contract – they must be anchored in a harmonized representation of the enterprise. Without that harmonization, neither humans nor agents can reliably see across domains or reason about second- and third-order effects. Humans can run isolated what-if analyses, but scaling those insights across the full enterprise is impractical when the underlying maps must be stitched together manually. The key point is that the emerging software stack requires customers to transform their technology model. The data platform alone is not enough. Systems of intelligence and systems of agency must work in tandem to provide the end-to-end visibility, shared meaning and decision-making context that define the agentic era. The next question we want to address is how AWS maps onto this architecture – and where its recent announcements signal its intent to lead. With the benefit of four days of re:Invent behind us, a clearer picture emerged of where AWS is investing and how it aligns to the evolving software stack shown above. When mapped against the model of data platforms, systems of intelligence, and systems of agency, the green layer – the system of intelligence – is still largely incomplete. It doesn’t come out of the box. Enterprises such as JPMorgan Chase, Dell Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. itself have had to build it themselves, whereas most mainstream enterprises don’t have the capability to do so. Where AWS is strong today is in the layers surrounding that gap. Bedrock has matured considerably. A year ago, reliability issues – struggles even with two and three nines – triggered urgent internal focus. That work appears to have paid off. Bedrock now serves as the abstraction layer above LLMs that AWS has long needed. AgentCore, introduced as a control framework for building multi-agent systems, shows real promise as well. Even more compelling are AWS’ first-party agents. The Kiro autonomous coding agents, along with new DevOps and security agents, formed some of the most interesting narratives of the week. They still have to earn customer trust, but the conceptual story around them is strong. These agentic capabilities, however, highlight the critical dependency on the missing middle layer. Agents are only as effective as the context they draw from. AI is programmed by data, and without a well-structured system of intelligence to feed them, their potential is limited. At the bottom of the stack, the data platform continues to evolve. SageMaker’s lakehouse features – especially S3’s expansion into table formats such as Iceberg – signal S3’s shift from a simple get/put object store into something more structurally aware. Neptune, AWS’ graph database, receives far less public attention, including its knowledge graph capabilities, yet it represents an important ingredient for shaping contextual data. in our view. This is where the divergence between AWS and Microsoft is instructive. Microsoft prefers to articulate where customers should be three to five years out and seed early product iterations – Fabric IQ being a recent example, potentially even designed to counter Palantir Technologies Inc.’s momentum. AWS, by contrast, tends to stay one step ahead of customers’ stated needs, solving problems incrementally rather than prescribing long-horizon architectures. Even so, Neptune already plays a role in bottom-up AI workload development, helping customers structure data for agentic applications. And one can imagine a future where Neptune joins S3 buckets and S3 tables as a more central mechanism for harmonizing data, though that would represent a strategic evolution for AWS. The broader takeaway is that AWS is prioritizing agent-specific tooling. As Swami Sivasubramanian, Amazon’s vice president of agentic AI, put it in his keynote, the company wants to be “the best place to build agents.” On that dimension, progress is evident and deserving of high marks. But the system of intelligence – the contextual substrate agents depend on – is still an open frontier across the industry. Vendors such as Palantir and Celonis SE operate directly to address this space, but no one vendor has yet solved the problem at scale. AWS may lean on Neptune, expand the capabilities of S3, or take a different path altogether. What’s certain in our view is that the green layer – the harmonized representation of data and process knowledge – is the piece that will ultimately determine how far agentic architectures can go. The DevOps agent emerged last week as one of the most consequential pieces of AWS’ agentic strategy. When mapped onto the emerging software stack – systems of intelligence in green and systems of agency in yellow – the DevOps agent sits in the layer that orchestrates digital operations. Understanding why this matters requires looking at the complexity of modern enterprise estates. A DevOps agent must reason across sprawling, heterogeneous environments composed of infrastructure, middleware, application components and thousands of microservices. Unlike a monolithic system such as SAP, where a single vendor created an end-to-end framework with well-understood internals, AWS environments are far more open-ended. The DevOps agent is designed to look across all of digital operations, identify when something breaks, determine the root cause and, when confidence is high enough, execute a remediation plan – potentially without human intervention. This introduces an important concept in that DevOps agents function as training wheels for the broader system of intelligence. They represent a prototype of what an enterprise-wide reasoning layer could become. Digital operations are only one slice of the problem. The full system of intelligence must encompass all business operations, and that requires a 4D map of the enterprise that shows how systems connect, their dependencies and how actions in one domain influence outcomes in another. AWS described this mapping capability as topology – an attempt to learn a representation of how Amazon services and infrastructure components interrelate. Conversations with vendors such as Datadog Inc., Dynatrace Inc., Splunk Inc. and Elasticsearch B.V. revealed that each has deep visibility into its own domain and partial insight into adjacent ones. Dynatrace, for example, places a probe on every host, enabling it to construct a causal graph – a kind of twin of digital operations. The DevOps agent uses these external views when needed. When it identifies a problem but lacks sufficient visibility to diagnose it, it can call out to partners such as Dynatrace and say, in effect: Run the deeper query for me. This bottom-up collaboration hints at how a general system of intelligence may ultimately emerge – not as a single monolithic product but as an aggregation of increasingly broad platforms across an ecosystem. This raises a broader architectural question related to top-down versus bottom-up approaches. A pure bottom-up approach risks “boiling the ocean” – digging two tunnels from multiple directions without a guarantee that the tunnels meet in the middle. A purely top-down approach lacks grounding in operational reality. The workable model appears to be a hybrid where the the outcome is defined top-down, then stitched together with the necessary data bottom-up to support that outcome. In practice, this might look like deploying the DevOps agent for a specific service area and augmenting it with Dynatrace data to achieve end-to-end visibility. Once that outcome works, extend it incrementally to additional services. This creates the scaffolding for a system of intelligence one outcome at a time – a middle-out expansion if you will, anchored by practical workflows. The DevOps agent therefore serves two purposes: 1) It solves a tangible operational problem today; and 2) It lights the path toward an enterprise-wide intelligence layer that will ultimately govern agentic systems. Kiro, first announced at the AWS Summit in New York, took on new significance last week. Anyone who still believes AWS is behind in AI need only look at the cadence and depth of innovations emerging around Kiro and its autonomous coding capabilities. Despite that, the keynote significantly understated its importance, in our view. Developers we spoke with emphasized that Kiro is quickly becoming central to their workflows. And the reason is that Kiro goes beyond the vibe-coding paradigm that has dominated the last year. Developers, by the way, still love Cursor, which continues to sets the standard. For months, the conversation in AI-assisted development has centered on scaffolding – the supporting structures that transform rapidly evolving models into agentic applications. Tools such as GitHub Copilot pioneered “code complete” – hit tab, finish your line. Cursor advanced the state of the art by customizing the integrated development environment so developers could chat with the agent, enabling longer-horizon tasks. Google’s Antigravity, which came from the Windsurf acquisition, followed the same path. These tools are powerful, but they remain forms of vibe coding. The artifact is still the code. You live in the code. You fix the code. The scaffolding evolves as models advance. Kiro breaks from this model and enters new ground. Instead of writing code and letting the agent assist, Kiro starts upstream – with the requirements document. The agent works at the ideation level, partnering with the developer to flesh out specifications, tighten ambiguities, highlight missing details and introduce best practices. The requirements document then feeds into a design document, creating a clear specification. Only then does Kiro generate code. And crucially, the code is disposable. When the software needs to evolve, you don’t traverse through the codebase trying to predict what will break. You update the requirements, adjust the design and regenerate the code from the spec. This reverses decades of software engineering logic. The artifact is no longer the code – it is the specification. Though Cursor can function similarly, it is still code-first out of the box. Even more striking is the potential impact on legacy systems. AWS’ Transform product can reverse-engineer a design document from an existing codebase. AWS believes it can go further and generate the requirements specification itself. That opens the door to something the vibe-coding world has not addressed – brownfield modernization. Instead of writing elaborate migration plans or manually dissecting aging monoliths, enterprises may be able to produce specifications from legacy code and move forward iteratively, regenerating components as needed. This is why Kiro is so significant, in our opinion. It elevates the abstraction from writing code to defining intent. This aligns with the broader shift toward agents, systems of intelligence, and outcome-oriented architectures. When AWS first introduced Kiro, it gave a nod to vibe coding because it was the trend of the moment. But even then, they hinted that Kiro represented something more. The story last week at re:Invent emphasized this is not another flavor of assisted coding. It is a new model for how software gets built, maintained and evolves. AgentCore emerged as one of the most pivotal announcements of the week because it represents the scaffolding required to make agents production-grade. Bedrock has steadily matured into the foundational abstraction layer for model access, but AgentCore sits alongside it as the operational backbone for multi-agent systems. It is the control infrastructure that governs how agents behave, how they coordinate and how they remain within defined boundaries. AgentCore provides the essentials of memory, runtime services, utilities like code interpreter and – critically – observability and policy enforcement. These capabilities matter because agents are not like traditional software components. Governing a data platform is relatively straightforward. Policies answer simple questions like who can access which data, under what conditions? Even column-based or tag-based controls remain manageable within deterministic systems. Agents are different. They take actions. They chain actions. They invoke tools. They do so with varying parameters, in varied contexts, and with probabilistic reasoning. The policy framework must therefore answer far more complex questions such as: Should this agent be allowed to take this action, with these parameters, in this context, in pursuit of this goal? That level of governance is exponentially more sophisticated than anything required in legacy data or application systems. This is why AgentCore is significant. Putting agents into production requires deterministic enterprise scaffolding – strong guardrails, clear boundaries, actionable observability and the ability to enforce policy across dynamic behaviors. This is heavy enterprise software, not something LLM vendors are likely to deliver. Frontier labs focus on models, not operational governance. Enterprises need a control plane that can manage armies of agents reliably, safely and consistently. Again, this is a debate inside theCUBE Research, which we’ll continue to explore. AgentCore begins to fill this gap. It establishes the governance fabric that agents must operate within and provides the layer into which downstream capabilities – systems of intelligence and systems of agency – will ultimately connect. It is the early architecture of agent-native operations, and AWS appears intent on owning this part of the stack. Among all the news coming out of re:Invent, Nova Forge stands out as the most strategically significant. The framework aligns directly with our thesis that enterprises will differentiate by owning their data, customizing their models, and building systems of intelligence that reflect their proprietary workflows. Nova Forge serves as the mechanism that makes this possible. It is the first offering from a major U.S. vendor that delivers open weights and training data, giving customers the ability to adapt the model to their own environments. The availability of training data is a critical distinction. While startups continue to build on lower-cost open-weight models such as DeepSeek, those offerings generally include weights only – not the underlying data. Nova Forge allows enterprises to substitute, augment or extend the training corpus with their own information, creating a model tuned to their specific context and competitive advantage. This introduces several strategic dynamics. Customizing a model through pretraining or reinforcement learning effectively welds an enterprise to that version of the model. When the next, more capable model arrives months later, the tuning process must be repeated. The complexity is not just operational – it can introduce behavioral instability as models shift. This is why some frontier-model providers, particularly those whose businesses depend on API consumption, actively discourage customers from performing deep reinforcement learning. Their pitch is if you avoid the heavy customization, you sacrifice some tight integration but stay aligned with the rapid improvement cycle of frontier models. This perspective underscores a broader debate about how the enterprise AI stack will evolve. One argument holds that frontier-model companies will become the next great software vendors, providing layers of tooling atop their LLMs to simplify enterprise integration. The counterargument is that mainstream enterprises – and the ISVs serving them – will need far more specialization than a handful of frontier models can deliver. Agents are not just RPA 2.0; they represent much more. As these agents proliferate, organizations will require a diverse portfolio of models, many of them small and highly specialized. In that world, frontier models play a role – but as orchestrators, handling complex planning and reasoning. The bulk of enterprise differentiation will come from customized, specialized models trained on proprietary data. Nova Forge is the first major signal that AWS intends to support this path by delivering open weights, open data and the ability for customers to shape the intelligence layer of their enterprise directly. A major subplot at re:Invent was AWS’ forceful claim that it is the best place to run Nvidia Corp. GPUs. That declaration hits with irony, given the persistent narrative that AWS lacks allocation, faces political challenges with Nvidia, and is focused on its own silicon efforts – Trainium in particular. Meanwhile, public commentary from outlets such as CNBC continues to over-index on competition to Nvidia, framing tensor processing units, Trainium and other accelerators as existential threats. The reality is more nuanced. GPUs are expensive, and performance per watt is the defining metric. Volume determines learning curves. And on that dimension, Nvidia remains in the driver’s seat. High volume gives Nvidia cost advantage, supply advantage and architectural advantage. Unless the company stumbles, the position is theirs to lose. Nvidia also locked up the leading process nodes at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. securing massive capacity. It is reminiscent of Apple Inc. 15 years ago: No competitor could match its handset performance because Apple had tied up the most advanced silicon for entire product cycles. No alternative supplier could close the gap. AWS’ historical challenge in securing Nvidia volume traces back to its own infrastructure strategy. The company spent years building Nitro, designing composable data centers, expanding instance types, optimizing storage and networking, and refining hypervisors. That approach made AWS infrastructure-smart – but not the earliest or largest buyer of full-stack Nvidia systems. When the ChatGPT moment hit, Nvidia wanted to sell integrated data center kits, not just racks. Providers that lacked infrastructure sophistication were forced to buy everything, and in return they received the larger allocations. That included Microsoft and the neoclouds, and Oracle as well – though in Oracle’s case, the scale-up design served the needs of its database architecture. Then came a second, largely unspoken issue: failure rates. For the last 12 months, the volume GPU has been the GB200. Multiple sources reported that failure rates were as high as 50%. No one talked about it publicly. The industry was reluctant to make Nvidia look bad and risk a reduction in allocation. But the implications were that supply would continue to be constrained. This was the year hyperscaler capital spending surged, and Wall Street was left wondering where the returns were. Utilization was low for reasons almost nobody understood externally. The shift began in October, when the GB300 surpassed the GB200 in volume. The GB300 installs more smoothly, runs more reliably and appears to deliver meaningfully higher quality. Neocloud providers such as Lambda reported excellent performance from GB300 systems. As GPU specialists willing to buy full stacks, they secured allocations consistent with that model. This dynamic contributed to the broader narrative of the “GPU-rich” and the “GPU-poor.” The GPU-rich could advance model training, inference and agentic workloads aggressively, while the GPU-poor were stuck rationing capacity. But now the dynamics may change as infrastructure-smart providers – those that invested in custom silicon and composable data centers – begin to leverage their own accelerators for meaningful workloads. There is enough Trainium deployed inside AWS to run frontier models such as Anthropic for inference at scale. Training remains a different story, despite public commitments on both sides. Anthropic’s leadership has acknowledged that training on Nvidia would require far fewer chips, which explains why it negotiated a larger deal with Google to run on TPUs – even as AWS invested billions in the company. Still, TPU volume will remain limited. Google will not match Nvidia’s scale unless Nvidia falters. Nvidia sells to Google’s competitors. Neoclouds depend on Nvidia allocation and are unlikely to compromise it. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft is going to shift to TPUs. Volume determines trajectory, and Nvidia’s volume remains unmatched. Could TPUs create pricing pressure? Possibly. A credible competitor gives buyers negotiating leverage. Nvidia’s 70% margins may face some compression. But the software ecosystem, tooling, libraries, and developer familiarity remain heavily skewed toward Nvidia. The lesson from this week is that AWS is becoming more assertive about the GPU story because it believes its infrastructure – combined with Nitro, Trainium and rapidly improving Nvidia integration – positions it strongly for the next phase of AI infrastructure. But the industry-wide GPU story is more complicated than energy constraints and data center buildouts. It includes an unspoken constraint in that high GPU failure rates, massive CapEx tied up in underutilized infrastructure, and a rapidly maturing next-generation GPU cycle is reshuffling the hierarchy of who is GPU-rich and who is GPU-poor. The slide above tells the story of two worlds. On the left sits the pursuit of messiah-level AGI – the frontier labs chasing grand breakthroughs. On the right is the hard, unglamorous scaffolding required to make AI useful in enterprises. The contrast underscores a fundamental divide. The frontier narrative often centers around singular breakthroughs and personalities, while the enterprise ecosystem is focused on building practical systems. The hyperscalers, ISVs and large incumbents are constructing the heavy scaffolding at both the agent layer and the data layer. AgentCore represents the control and governance framework. But the other half of the equation is even more foundational – bringing together data and action in a consistent, governed system. Actions – meaning tools and callable workflows – must pair with data, which provides the context that guides what an agent should do. When those come together coherently, the result is a knowledge graph, and that “4D Map” becomes the system of intelligence. This is hard enterprise software work, and frontier LLM vendors are not database vendors or workflow vendors. They are a long way from building this substrate. Enterprises that operate at scale – Amazon.com, large banks such as JPMorgan, and major technology firms that include Dell – confirm that they must build this system of intelligence themselves. It does not exist out of the box. Our early work, such as the “Uber for All” model explored years ago, hinted at the idea of people, places, things, activities – drivers, riders, prices, locations – brought together into a unified digital representation of an enterprise. That remains the ambition today: a real-time, four-dimensional map of the business. It’s why the agentic era will take most of a decade to unfold, in our view. Analytics-oriented vendors can provide slices of this capability today, but only within confined analytic domains. Building the full operational twin of the enterprise – harmonized, contextualized and ready for agents – is a far larger undertaking. The slide above shows a camel covered in logos – more logos than a camel has fleas. The image captures the current frenzy. The market’s reaction to the word “agent” has resembled a Pixar moment when someone yells “squirrel,” and the dogs instantly lose focus. In this cycle, someone yells “agent,” and venture capital runs at full speed. The problem is that most of these agent startups are built on only the thinnest layer of scaffolding. Some domain agents – such as those in legal tech – carry embedded knowledge of workflows. But the vast majority lack the heavy lifting required for real enterprise value. They do not solve the integration challenge between data, action space, and governance. They do not provide the agent control apparatus. They do not offer the system of intelligence. The companies doing that work are the hyperscalers and the major software vendors. The differentiation will not come from shiny agent UIs or narrow features. It will come from the depth of integration with data systems, workflow systems and the governance and control planes that bind agents to enterprise policy and process. That’s why this era will be defined not by the number of agents a vendor can showcase, but by the scaffolding that underpins them. And that scaffolding is where the real enterprise value will accrue in our view. The final slide above ties the entire discussion together, showing how the emerging software stack will take shape and where different players fit. The center of gravity – the high-value real estate – is the system of intelligence layer. Companies such as Celonis and Palantir are furthest along, in our view, though they take different approaches. Palantir remains services-heavy but has made significant software advances. Other graph-centric and process-centric vendors such as ServiceNow Inc., SAP SE, Salesforce In. and essentially every SaaS company with embedded process logic, are now targeting this same layer. To participate meaningfully, these players must build out their data platforms and confront a major business-model transition. As they merge process logic with data and enable agents to take increasingly autonomous action, they weaken their traditional seat-based subscription models. This is an innovator’s dilemma in real time. For example a $50 billion dashboard-centric industry (BI) faces disruption. Efforts to introduce “talk to your data” interfaces are part of that response, but they do not change the underlying economics. Below the system-of-intelligence layer sit the data platforms: Snowflake, Databricks and the lakehouse constructs of SageMaker and S3. Above it sits the system of agency – Bedrock and the agent-control frameworks. And throughout the stack, governance is ubiquitous; every major player is adding governance layers to address the risks of agentic systems. Meanwhile, the software development lifecycle is shifting from a linear pre-gen AI workflow to one that is nonlinear, interactive and deeply agent-driven. As the hardware stack is redefined – compute, storage and networking – the entire software stack is being redefined with it. Zooming out from re:Invent 2025 and the broader move toward service-as-software, the momentum feels like early baby steps toward a decade-long transformation. Two major trends are emerging: The bubble is not bursting, but it is growing. There may be some deflation on the consumer side, particularly around OpenAI’s positioning, but enterprise activity is only beginning. Building worker-bee AGI beyond basic RPA 2.0 and microservices 2.0 is a long, challenging road. But the productivity gains across software development and operations tools will be large and immediate. Over time, those agentic capabilities will migrate into every enterprise process, creating the marginal-economics advantage that defines the service-as-software model. The broader market dynamics may feel bubblicious – echoing Ray Dalio’s comment that we’re “80% of the way into the bubble.” Whether that was macro commentary or a push for his preferred trades, the point stands in that bubbles don’t burst until something pricks them. We’re not there yet. History shows pullbacks of 10% or more can happen repeatedly during an expansion, as they did in the dot-com era. Recent market disruptions look more like early tremors than the hard correction that would unwind current valuations. The agentic era is coming. Its shape is becoming somewhat more clear. But the real transformation – the unified data foundation, the system of intelligence, the governed agent layer – will take the better part of a decade to mature.

Shares of Confluent (CFLT) surged Monday morning after IBM (IBM) announced a deal to acquire the software maker for $31 per share, valuing Confluent at $11 billion. Confluent's software helps companies manage and organize large amounts of data, an in-demand service as many companies are looking to manage massive data sets that are used in the training and running of artificial intelligence models. IBM said that Confluent "excels at preparing data for AI, keeping it clean and connected across systems and applications, eliminating silos inherent in agentic AI." IBM said that the company's total addressable market has doubled in the last four years to $100 billion. IBM will acquire Confluent with cash on hand, and said it expects the deal to close by the middle of next year as Confluent's largest shareholders, which control about 62% of the stock's voting power, have agreed to vote in favor of the deal. Confluent shares were up 29% in midday trading Monday. Coming into the week, the stock had lost 17% of its value since the start of the year. The stock of a company being acquired typically surges as investors look to buy in below the announced deal price, $31 per share in Confluent's case. The news of the IBM deal sent Confluent's share price into positive territory for 2025. IBM shares were up 1.5%, boosting the stock's year-to-date gain to 42%. IBM is among the top performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025, trailing only heavy machinery maker Caterpillar (CAT) and investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The deal could be a boost for IBM's software business, which it could use as slowing sales growth in its hybrid cloud segment disappointed investors in its latest earnings report in October. Wedbush analysts said following the announcement that they "believe this acquisition represents a strong move by IBM to continue adding more data processing capabilities to its hybrid cloud ecosystem while driving profitable growth over time." The analysts added that Confluent is "a natural fit for IBM’s long-term growth strategy as the company addresses IBM’s focus on eliminating data silos for powering AI," and said they "loudly applaud" what they expect will be one of more acquisitions to come. The Wall Street Journal had reported late Sunday that the sides were close to a deal. Reports emerged in October that Confluent was considering a sale and working with a bank to sort through its options, from private equity firms to tech companies.

Title: BlackRock files for listing staked Ether ETF

The fund, if approved by the SEC, would give BlackRock investors indirect exposure to staked Ether, one of the industry’s first following the 2024 approval of spot Ether ETFs. US-based asset management company BlackRock has applied to list and trade shares of an investment vehicle tied to staked Ether, following its offering of other cryptocurrency products. In a Friday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock filed a Form S-1 registration statement for its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund. The filing is part of the SEC’s process for companies to list investment vehicles such as ETFs, but does not guarantee approval. Shares of the staked Ether (ETH) fund, which BlackRock intends to list and trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker ETHB, could be one of the first offerings tied to staked cryptocurrencies. Grayscale Investments added staking functionality to its previously approved spot ETH and mini ETH trusts in October. The regulator has not greenlighted many crypto staking funds since initially approving spot Ether ETFs in May 2024. However, Canary Capital made a similar SEC filing for a staked Injective (INJ) product in July, and Grayscale and Bitwise launched separate staking products tied to Solana (SOL) in October. BlackRock manages the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which is listed under the ticker symbol IBIT. Related: Spot Ether ETF staking could ‘dramatically reshape the market’ Larry Fink, who co-founded BlackRock in 1988, said before Bitcoin’s 2017 bull run that the cryptocurrency “shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” In the years since, and as the US digital asset market grew in volume and usage, the CEO has made more bullish remarks on crypto investments, including by supporting BlackRock’s launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF and others. In The New York Times’ DealBook Summit last week, Fink said he had had a “big shift” in his opinions of crypto, but still referred to BTC as an “asset of fear.” Magazine: XRP’s ‘now or never’ moment, Kalshi taps Solana: Hodler’s Digest, Nov. 30 – Dec. 6 Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Retail job cuts up nearly 140% from last year

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In the first 11 months of the year, the industry has recorded nearly 92,000 job cuts, with over 3,200 in November alone, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas. While announced job cuts in the retail industry grew from October, across all industries job cuts were down more than 50% from last month. “Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008.” Some of retail’s biggest companies have announced significant layoffs in recent months. Target announced in October it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles, representing about 8% of the retailer’s global headquarters workforce. That same month, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 roles in an effort to stay “nimble.” Yankee Candle this month said it would lay off 900 people, about 10% of its global professional and clerical staff. The sector’s early holiday performance, however, may make way for additional hires before the year is over, Challenger said. “The increased spending over the Black Friday and the Thanksgiving weekend may give rise to hires in December right before the holiday,” Challenger said. “It’s unclear, however, if those positions will last into the New Year.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Retailers in lower-traffic shopping centers require excellent associates, individualized operations and realistic expectations, experts say.

In the spirit of the magic of the season (and in hopes of providing some warm respite from the usual end-of-the-year best-of deluge of stories and their attendant doldrums), IndieWire is proud to present our first-ever Holiday Week. [Editor’s note: This list was originally published in December 2022. It has since been updated with new entries.] Rockin’ around the Christmas tree at the Christmas movie stop! That’s right: You’ve reached the North Pole of movie recommendations, where our toymakers (read: film critics) have been hard at work sifting through titles all year long. It’s easy to think of holiday movies as the one area of cinema audiences have permission to practically forget about the rest of the year. With a limited window between Thanksgiving and Christmas, most film lovers can only make time for a handful of seasonally appropriate screenings before New Year’s snaps our attention back to awards season and the big Best Picture contenders. Plus, with new yuletide offerings hitting theaters and streaming platforms in a steady flurry throughout December, there’s only so much time to enjoy Christmas classics while staying current on new holiday fare. Selection is made even more complex when you get into the Christmas genre’s inexplicable tendency toward gatekeeping. It’s a frustrating reality of the movie machine that some titles, for no real discernible reason, get saddled with debates that have relatively little to do with their stories. Such is the case with John McTiernan’s “Die Hard”: the 1988 action-packed crowdpleaser starring Bruce Willis that’s become synonymous with the contentious classification of so-called “Christmas movies” and the separately defined “movies set at Christmas.” In curating this list, we’ve disregarded that delineation, allowing Stanley Kubrick’s psychosexual thriller “Eyes Wide Shut” and Bob Clark’s slasher “Black Christmas” their rightful spots alongside traditional TV specials, from “A Charlie Brown Christmas” to “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” The best Christmas movies, as defined here, make up a collection of films celebrating and/or challenging the holiday while using its motifs and themes to explore the light and dark sides of the human spirit. Selections have been ranked with both Christmas relevance and overall film quality in mind. Check out IndieWire’s guide to the best Thanksgiving movies. With editorial contributions by David Ehrlich, Jim Hemphill, Sarah Shachat, and Christian Zilko. You’d be hard-pressed to find a Disney fan willing to argue “Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas” is “better” than the original. But director Andy Knight’s straight-to-VHS release from 1997 — a “midquel” imagining Belle and the Beast’s first Christmas, from before Gaston leads that angry mob to their castle in the first film — is ridiculously magical. The story sees none other than Tim Curry give voice to the formidable Forte. A grumpy composer turned into an evil pipe organ by the witch’s curse, the hidden gem Disney villain doesn’t want the spell broken because he likes his new life. The late Paul Reubens voices Forte’s right-hand, Fife, a trembling piccolo willing to do anything for the solo his conductor has promised him if the Beast doesn’t become human. “Enchanted Christmas” makes heavy use of early CGI (Forte himself is entirely digital) and it lacks much of the hand-drawn charm that made the earlier masterpiece. But with Bernadette Peters adding even more holiday cheer — she’s a tree angel and love interest for Lumiere (Jerry Orbach, again) — this is the seed that planted the forest of holiday spin-offs Disney devotees continue to enjoy each year. —AF Netflix has attempted more than its fair share of Christmas movies, including Best Animated Feature nominee “Klaus” in 2019. But “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” stands out from the streaming service’s crowd — offering everything from a Dolly Parton musical to Kurt Russell as Santa — with writer/director David Talbert’s delightfully overstuffed celebration of holiday excess. A blistering race through Christmas spectacle, musical bangers, top-notch acting, and maybe (read: definitely) one too many steampunk-inspired visual effects, “Jingle Jangle” makes for a snow globe-like display akin to a modern spin on the chorus line musical extravaganzas of yesteryear. Originally envisioned as a stage production, the 2020 straight-to-streaming film follows Forest Whittaker’s inventor character as he bonds with his brilliant granddaughter, portrayed by Madalen Mills. Together, they pull off a harrowing rescue mission, unravel a dastardly plot, and find new hope in the holiday spirit. —AF For the only tie on this list, we offer up two adaptations of Dr. Seuss’ “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” (knowing full well there are at least two other features you could consider that don’t make the cut). The 1957 children’s story was adapted first by “Looney Tunes” artist Chuck Jones and his longtime collaborator Ben Washam in a brilliantly crafted animated special, which aired on CBS in December 1966. This version boasts Boris Karloff as the voice of the Grinch: a performance that would shape the humbug-turned-unlikely hero for decades to come. Channelling Karloff’s rendering and the curling physicality of Jones and Washam’s illustrative design, Jim Carrey totally embodies the fabled mean one in Ron Howard’s live-action outing from 2000. The aughts favorite is perhaps most celebrated for its quotable lines (“Am I just eating because I’m bored?”) but is infamous for its intense prosthetics and costuming, which Carrey reportedly despised. Still, it earned three Oscar nominations and won for Best Makeup. —AF On par with “The Music Box” and “Way Out West” as a matter of family fun, this Laurel and Hardy musical from 1934 adapts parts of Victor Herbert’s 1903 stage production for a fantastic fairytale adventure revolving around a home mortgage dispute (yes, really). The film’s slap-happy concoction of over-the-top physicality, show-stopping musical numbers, and recognizable storybook characters – including the big man himself, Santa — makes this comedy of errors in Toyland, also known as “March of the Wooden Soldiers,” the best version to date. There have been multiple “Babes in Toyland” movies made for TV, as well as Disney’s 1961 theatrical feature and 1997’s animated take from MGM. —AF Considering the prevalence of his origin story, it’s a wonder Rudolph hasn’t enjoyed a more successful run in film. Sure, Santa’s ninth reindeer appears in some form or another for most of the big man’s movies; even “The Nightmare Before Christmas” gives Jack’s ghost dog Zero an excuse to cosplay as his yuletide counterpart. But as far as standalone Rudolph outings go, nothing has surpassed the 1964 stop-motion TV special (first aired on NBC) and the instantly recognizable franchise it would inspire. “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” joyfully expands on its namesake poem (and song!) with a story introducing new characters, from love interest Clarice to the Abominable Snow Monster. That tradition would continue in prequel and sequel films, most notably with the iconic Heat Miser in 1974’s “The Year Without Santa Claus.” Still, this is one instance where, if you only have time to enjoy a single film, the original can’t be beat for its hand-crafted care and inherent nostalgia. —AF No, don’t scoff! Yes, “Last Christmas” is a shaggy, odd thing of a film, and yes, the end twist is infamously ridiculous (and also pretty easy to see coming). But Paul Feig’s underrated London Christmas fantasy is also a moving portrayal of self-improvement and growth, with a genuinely wonderful turn from Emilia Clarke as an aimless and surly menial shop worker at its center. Struggling after a health emergency and carrying strained relationships with pretty much everyone in her life, Clarke’s Kate gets a new lease on life when she meets and bonds with Henry Golding’s charming Tom. But “Last Christmas” actually works best when it isn’t a romance: there’s some real edge to Clarke’s portrayal of Kate and her self-destructive attitude that gives the film some unexpected grit, and the screenplay manages to make her eventual redemption feel genuinely earned. Plus, they deliver what you want from a movie with this title, with a stirring closing performance of Wham’s “Last Christmas” that’s simply magical. —WC A simple but nourishing ode to the power of good deeds, “We’re No Angels” sees famous hardboiled cynic Humphrey Bogart take a stab at spreading cheer and whimsy. Michael Curtiz’s film sees the “Casablanca” leading man play Joseph, a prisoner who jail breaks himself from Devil’s Island along with two buddies (Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray), taking refuge in a local shop. Although they plan to rob the place blind and leave, a Christmas dinner with the kindhearted, struggling family makes them reconsider, as they dedicate themselves to helping their hosts instead. A little weird and wild in its plotting (a venomous snake comes into play), “We’re No Angels” nonetheless is a sweet and simple tale of Christmas redemption, that also has a wee dash of effortless Bogart suave. —WC This horror film about a kid traumatized on Christmas who grows up to go on a killing spree while dressed as Santa sparked national outrage when it was released in 1984, angering parents and critics with both its content and its lurid marketing materials. (Those of us who grew up in the era will never forget the poster with Santa coming out of the chimney with an ax.) As is so often the case, the movie itself got lost in the controversy — which is a shame, because it’s a stone cold slasher masterpiece. Filled with genuine wit and gleeful irony courtesy of screenwriter Michael Hickey, it’s very funny and earns its shocks; director Charles Sellier was a TV producer with hundreds of hours of on-set experience, and his proficient craftsmanship makes this a grim, hilarious Christmas classic. —JH One year before “Die Hard,” writer Shane Black and director Richard Donner brought us the first truly great Christmas action movie of the 80s and made the definitive buddy cop flick in the process. From the opening strains of “Jingle Bell Rock” on the soundtrack and the expertly choreographed shoot-out in a Christmas tree lot to the overall sense of bittersweet holiday melancholy that permeates the proceedings, this is pure Christmas cinema nirvana. Shane Black would return to the holidays many times in many great films (“The Long Kiss Goodnight,” “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” “Play Dirty”), but this is the gold standard. —JH It’s been overshadowed in recent years by Greta Gerwig’s genuinely revelatory adaptation, but the 1994 “Little Women” film by Gillian Armstrong has its charms and its pleasures, from a brilliant performance as Jo by a spirited Winona Ryder, an early killer role from Kirsten Dunst as a young Amy, and Christian Bale giving a defining heartthrob turn as a particularly charming Laurie. And like all adaptations of Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel, the 1994 “Little Women” is a perfect movie to watch during the holidays, between the comforting golden hue with which it renders its rural Massachusetts setting and the bright, decadent costumes on display. The Christmas scenes are more tearjerking than they are joyous, though. —WC Shane Black returns to the subgenre he invented in “Lethal Weapon” with another terrific Christmas action script, this one about an amnesiac teacher (Geena Davis) who learns she was a ruthless assassin in a past life. Director Renny Harlin tears into Black’s script like a Doberman into a prime rib, milking every last set piece for maximum impact — the shoot-outs, car chases, and knife fights are spectacularly entertaining and get a lot of added flavor out of the Christmastime setting. Holiday purists might be put off by the Christmas cheer existing alongside violent torture scenes and Geena Davis spouting dialogue like, “Suck my dick,” but if cynical Christmas movies are your thing, this one is tough to beat. —JH There are many horrible Christmas movies Netflix has inflicted upon the world, from “The Christmas Prince” to “Hot Frosty.” Easily the best, and a genuine treat to treasure, is Sergio Pablos’ wonderful animated confection “Klaus.” An origin story of sorts for Santa, in which he’s a reclusive toymaker in a distant Northern town befriended and aided by a lazy postal worker, “Klaus” could easily verge on the silly: do we really need a prequel to the Santa mythos? But the film just works, with a sweet message preaching the importance of generosity and the perfect mix of humor and heart. And the film also looks gorgeous, using detailed, gorgeously lit 2D animation to bring its winter wonderland to life. —WC The holidays can provide a lovely opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones. But, as great artists like Éric Rohmer understand so well, they can be deeply isolating weeks for single people without an obvious place to go. Random meetings with strangers can escalate into deeper connections than you might find at any other time of year — but holidays are inherently ephemeral, and many of those newfound friendships and romances are destined to end. “My Night at Maud’s” is a brilliant film about those fleeting holiday connections. Most of its characters don’t start out as strangers, per se, but they wouldn’t be nearly as close of friends at any other time of year. Cold winter nights are broken up by lengthy conversations about Pascal’s Wager, and the romance that seems to loom around the corner is thwarted by the reality that intellectual chemistry need not be indicative of any larger compatibility. The script is Rohmer’s brand of cerebral filmmaking at its absolute best, all building towards a denouement in which nothing really changes externally but everyone is left with a treasured memory. It’s not your stereotypical holiday movie, yet it hits like a snowglobe — a perfectly preserved winter memory you can return to again and again. —CZ A heavily-Tarantino inspired crime comedy, Doug Liman’s “Go” doesn’t exactly scream Christmas cheer. But it’s set around the holidays, with the tantalizing image of a young shirtless Timothy Olyphant with a Santa hat draped on his head providing much of the Yuletide tie-in. Olyphant is just one of many, many young stars in the film, which also features people like Katie Holmes, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf, and young Jane Krakowski and Melissa McCarthy in small roles. They all liven up the funny, ramshackle story, set across one Christmas Eve night as they try and score drugs, head on an LA trip, and try to entrap a drug dealer. Spiky dialogue and a blindingly fast pace keep the film going like a festive rush that you never wish ends. —WC A warm, funny tableau more than a film, “Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point” is a touch long for a movie so plotless. Luckily, it’s so delightful that it’s hard to actually care. Tyler Thomas Taormina’s painfully accurate portrait of Long Island families — which will ring very close to home to anyone who’s ever grown up taking the LIRR into NYC — features a massive ensemble playing the Balsano family, a large clan who crowd around the table of their matriarch’s home for what seems destined to be the last time. While there’s some business with the rebellious teens (including Francesca Scorsese and Elsie Fisher) sneaking away, “Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point” is mostly content to paint a picture of the stress, anger, and joy that comes from the holiday, and the melancholy inherent to the season. —WC “In Bruges” is only a Christmas movie in the sense that “Die Hard” is a Christmas movie. But cinephiles big and small should still jump at the chance to toast the season with Martin McDonagh — a filmmaker whose knack for delivering violent fairytales to unsuspecting audiences rivals even Santa’s grasp on global gift giving. When Irish hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to hide in the Belgian city of Bruges after a botched job, involving a priest and altar boy (yay, Catholic guilt!), they’re met with an ironically cheery setting. Shiny nostalgia can’t keep criminals off the naughty list though, and it’s not long before they’re stuck in a bloody, whipsmart game of cat-and-mouse that makes Chevy Chase and the squirrel from “Christmas Vacation” look like friends. It’s a dazzling testament to McDonagh’s unique ability to balance dark and light, and even as a passive backdrop, winter festivities pair remarkably well with Farrell and Gleeson’s undeniable chemistry. “In Bruges” came out in 2008, years before the Oscar-winning “Banshees of Inisherin” reunited the actors, and Ralph Fiennes’ role as a crime boss here will make you wish he was in that film, too. Watch both and you’ll dream of Little Jenny pulling a flying sleigh. —AF Winona Ryder’s red-headed Kim dancing in the flurries of “snow” beneath Edward’s ice sculpture. That unforgettable image is what takes Tim Burton’s 1990 suburban fairytale from a movie that just so happens to be a Christmas to the status of bonafide holiday classic. Aesthetically wrapped in the magic of the season but with a plot too often devoid of goodwill towards men, “Edward Scissorhands” at once weaponizes the annual stratification that comes with “My consumerist nightmare is better than your consumerist nightmare!” discourse while also allowing its characters to take refuge in the season’s pockets of joy. Featuring a memorable appearance by Vincent Price as Edward’s inventor, the film starring Johnny Depp intertwines a fairly predicated story of an outcast thrust into society with a unique character concept that elevates the rest of his sweet and sorrowful saga. —AF David Lowery’s “The Green Knight” is, canonically, a Christmas story. Sure, the 2021 film takes one of the oldest tales for the fireside in the English language and turns it into a trippy vision-quest interrogating the true nature of honor and morality with some of the lushest, most transporting, most bewildering visuals since “The Fall.” That may not sound too Christmas-y. But on the other hand: Dev Patel. Tell me you don’t want to watch Dev Patel flail around in the mud while you’re digesting your Christmas meal with a straight face; you can’t. Real ones know that “The Green Knight” is a fantastic Christmas movie because, like the best of them, it takes you to a place and a time wholly different from our own, and gets us to feel a little fonder, a little more grateful for our corner of this burning universe. Just be braced, if any normie relatives who happen to join you, you will probably get asked about what happens with the sash two-thirds of the way through. —SS After the production of “Ghostbusters,” Bill Murray took a hiatus from filmmaking that ended (barring a cameo or two) with “Scrooged,” which teamed him with Richard Donner for a blithe, comedic take on “The Christmas Carol” story. Scrooge is now Murray’s Frank Cross, a ruthless TV executive obsessed with financial gain who gets a chance at atonement when a series of ghosts visit him on Christmas Eve to try and help him learn the error of his ways. The film’s script is a little shaky, balancing its more mean-spirited humor with the eventual sentiment somewhat poorly, but it’s all okay when Murray is such a force as the sleezeball at the center. He makes Frank’s redemption sweet despite the script issues, turning the film into a holiday staple single-handedly. Like a lot of Murray films, though, you kinda like him better when he’s being an asshole. —WC Man, if you think your family argues at Christmas. Arguing is, honestly, kind of the premise of “The Lion In Winter.” After all, arguments are much more fun when they’re written by James Goldman — also behind the stellar ‘older people having feelings and also having swords’ film, “Robin and Marian” — and delivered with decades of built-up bombast by Catherine Hepburn and Peter O’Toole. The Anthony Harvey-directed movie finds the restless King Henry II (O’Toole) and the disgraced but still dangerous Eleanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn) thrown together for the Christmas season with their miserable failsons Richard (Anthony Hopkins), Geoffrey (John Castle), and John (Nigel Terry), who might be scheming against their dad. Everybody has feelings, betrayals, mad lusts for power, and a begrudging sense of connection, despite it all. “The Lion In Winter” has some of the biggest showdowns and grandest dialogue of any movie you’ll ever see, Christmas-themed or otherwise. In its largesse, it also has some of the most fun of any movie, Christmas-themed or otherwise. It’s well worth the trip to medieval times, where, as Eleanor sarcastically proclaims, “It’s 1183 and we’re barbarians!” —WC Appearing on IndieWire’s list of the best feminist horror movies ever made, this historic, final girl-defining slasher was directed by Bob Clark. Yes, that Bob Clark: the director behind the family favorite “A Christmas Story” among others. “Black Christmas” and “A Christmas Story” are tonally disparate projects, to be sure. Still, you’ll find a familiar glow akin to the Parker family’s Christmas tree lights framing plenty of frames in the the earlier horror flick: a warm halo around the suspense – and carnage — still to come. Set at a sorority house during the holidays, “Black Christmas” stars Olivia Hussey as protagonist Jess. When menacing phone calls turn to bumps in the night and finally someone turns up dead, our heroine is forced to confront a killer lurking closer than she thinks. With a seriously vexing conclusion — that’s effective but still maddening — “Black Christmas” is best saved for those willing to weather a yuletide nightmare only to come up with metaphoric coal come the ending. —AF “I made my family disappear.” In the role that turned a 10-year-old into a household name, Macaulay Culkin stars as “Home Alone” hero Kevin McAllister. Written and produced by John Hughes with Chris Columbus serving as director, this 1990 slapstick classic follows the MacGyver-esque Kevin after he’s accidentally left behind on his family’s Christmas vacation and forced to battle two home invaders back in his sleepy Chicago suburb. Jazzy Christmas carols and zippy one-liners (“Keep the change, ya filthy animal!”) bind Culkin’s gleeful starring performance to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern’s brilliant duo of burglars. But it’s Catherine O’Hara’s scenes, melting down as Kevin’s guilty and panicked mom Kate, that give the movie its enduring heart. “Home Alone” was followed up with a 1992 sequel set in New York City, once again starring Culkin, Pesci, Stern, and O’Hara. It’s a lesser movie, but still funny and well worth watching if you don’t already know what happens when Kevin spends a night at the Plaza. —AF Need a break from…everything? Let director Michael Curtiz’s 1954 Christmas spectacle transport you back in time with its old-world cool, polished performances, and gleefully bonkers musical logic. Princes of the silver screen Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play friends Bob and Phil, who become singing and songwriting partners after nearly dying in World War II. (Like we said, musical logic!) When the men run across sisters Betty and Judy, played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, the four embark on a jazzy journey to the shockingly not-so-snowy Vermont. Say what you will of the Technicolor film’s story, but there’s no debating “White Christmas” contains masterful music. The namesake tune won Best Original Song in 1942 and is prolific enough that it’s likely playing in your head right now. But for this writer, there’s just no beating the imagery evoked in the lesser-known “Snow,” sung by the four stars aboard a train car. (“It won’t be long before we’ll all be there with snow….” “I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow….”) —AF There’s an unabashed schmaltziness to writer/director Richard Curtis’ “Love Actually”: a Christmas rom-com that’s at once intoxicatingly cheery in its sentimentality and sharply clever with its intricate design and British wit. Mainly set in London, with one subplot taking us to the French countryside and later Portugal, the 2003 title has become synonymous with a specific story structure. And though that moniker is sometimes doled out disparagingly (here’s looking at you, Garry Marshall’s “Mother’s Day,” “Valentine’s Day,” and “New Year’s Eve”), there’s a reason so many tenderhearted movie lovers keep coming back to it. A star-studded cast — Colin Firth, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Laura Linney, Billy Nighy, and the late Alan Rickman, among others — charm their way through nine holiday tales tied together by character relationships and some iconic wrap-around narration from Hugh Grant, who plays a lovestruck prime minister. —AF Diane Keaton as the warm, thick-glasses-clad mom! Craig T. Nelson as the emotionally open and even-keeled dad! Luke Wilson as the stoner brother! Rachel McAdams as the tote-swinging, crunchy granola sister! Truly, there are very few fictional families that are more of a joy to spend Christmas with than the family Stone — though Sarah Jessica Parker’s uptight girlfriend forced to spend Christmas with them thanks to her boyfriend, a golden boy son played by Dermot Mulroney, would probably disagree. “The Family Stone” wasn’t a particularly well-received film upon release, but 20 years have made this Christmas comedy of errors a staple watch and a classic, and that’s all thanks to the incredible cast that manages the delicate balance between comedy and drama that Thomas Bezucha’s movie offers. McAdams is the standout, but everyone gets a moment to shine, and it’s really hard difficult to think of a better Christmas gift than vegging out to their antics for a second or third or 400th rewatch. —WC The Grinch may reign supreme as cinema’s most instantly recognizable Christmas scoundrel. But Billy Bob Thornton’s titular “Bad Santa,” a conman named Willie T. Soke who once a year teams up with his partner Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) to steal from shopping malls in a dastardly Santa scam, easily ranks among the top five holiday movie hooligans. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, this 2003 dark comedy achieves the kind of naughty fun later films (think the aptly named “A Bad Moms Christmas”) would attempt, but with an earnest nastiness that heightens its humor to near-flying sleigh heights. As Willie’s myriad addictions and intense selfishness threaten the criminals’ partnership — against a backdrop of scheming from a cast that includes Lauren Tom and Bernie Mac, plus the much-celebrated performance of then 8-year-old Brett Kelly — the explosively violent fallout forces the titular coal receiver to reconsider his life. “Bad Santa” was eventually followed by 2016’s “Bad Santa 2,” which offers some of the same fun but is significantly more clumsy than the first. —AF Unafraid to challenge the filmmakers who came before her, Greta Gerwig remade “Little Women” in 2019: the triumphant sixth film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s well-loved tale of four sisters growing up in Massachusetts at the turn of the century. The Best Picture nominee reunited its writer/director with “Lady Bird” star Saoirse Ronan as Jo alongside Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy, and Eliza Scanlen as Beth. Laura Dern and Bob Odenkirk played the girls’ parents with Timothée Chalamet rounding out the cast as love interest Laurie. Oh, did we mention Meryl Streep? In the most literal sense, “Little Women” is a Christmas film because it sets two pivotal scenes on the holiday. Alcott’s book famously opens with the girls grappling with a meager celebration on Christmas morning: an economic consequence of the American Civil War raging in the background. The second holiday in their story underlines the loss of one of the March sisters in a heartbreaking sequence that marks one of Gerwig’s most successful tragedies. But more than that, the film is brimming with love and sisterly affection as winter provides a fleeting backdrop to the heroines’ individual weighing of sorrow, acceptance, spirit, and defiance. —AF Accept no substitutes. Reject all remakes. If you want the story of a tough as iron and sharp as nails career woman, living in the Big City™ and forced, through a set of comedic circumstances, to pretend to be a farm wife for the holidays, look no further than 1945’s “Christmas In Connecticut.” The cast is lights-out incredible, anchored by Barbara Stanwyck as a woman’s advice columnist who’s never baked a pie, forced to return to her “family home” in Connecticut to present some homemaking bona fides for her oblivious publisher and ably abetted by Dennis Morgan as a navy man (it is 1945) who Stanwyck bring in from the cold, if you know what I mean. But the supporting ensemble is an embarrassment of riches. You could power TCM for a week off of each of them: Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Una O’Connor, Reginald Gardiner. This movie is just fun, in that good old-fashioned way, sparking and charming and directed with a spritely touch by Peter Godfrey. Many other films run exactly the same playbook as “Christmas In Connecticut.” But there are very few who run it better. —SS “Last Holiday” wouldn’t stand out in the metaphoric rom-com Christmas tree lot without shining star Queen Latifah perched atop its scraggly story. When a terminally ill woman discovers her health insurance won’t cover the price of a necessary operation (seriously dark, but that’s American healthcare for you!), she decides to blow the last of her money on a solo vacation to the Czech Republic. With LL Cool J as her strapping love interest, Latifah’s Georgia breathes endless life into a wintery adventure that sees her new outlook seriously confusing hotel staff and guests. A case of mistaken identity (with an extra layer of irony, once you know the film’s ending) leads Georgia down a bow and holly-adorned adventure of fine dining, mud masks, snowboarding, and pissing off Timothy Hutton’s pompous antagonist that’s nothing if not fun. —AF National Lampoon’s Vacation franchise consists of four films starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo. (There’s five if you count the 2015 reboot with Ed Helms and Christina Applegate, and six if you count the straight-to-video spinoff “Christmas Vacation 2”: a Randy Quaid vehicle from 2003 that barely makes it out of the metaphoric parking lot.) While there are merits to each of these harebrained family trips/events — particularly the original 1983 outing to Wally World directed by the late Harold Ramis — few would deny that writer/producer John Hughes and director Jeremiah S. Chechik’s “Christmas Vacation” is a top-of-the-tree, crowning achievement for the series. Reprising their parts as Clark and Ellen Griswold, Chase and D’Angelo are joined by the best ensemble cast the franchise ever saw with a sprawling family that’s only sometimes lovable but always believable. The 1985 comedy boasts supporting performances from then-kid actors Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki — the best Griswold kids ever cast — as well as Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the Griswolds’ memorably awful neighbors. (“Why is the carpet all wet, Todd?” “I don’t know, Margo.”) —AF Before the (surprisingly demanding?) era of Airbnb, swapping homes for Christmas break provided a romantic premise for Nancy Meyers’ “The Holiday.” Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz star as a Brit and an American — both spinning in the wake of infidelity in their relationships — who agree to stay in one another’s homes for the last two weeks of December. Once landed in Los Angeles and London respectively, the women run headlong into two aughts rom-com plots: prepared to their most satisfyingly saccharine. Jude Law plays opposite Diaz as a handsome book editor reeling from the loss of his late wife and struggling to cope with single parenthood. Back in the States, Jack Black charms Winslet as a movie score composer whose affable charisma would make him an obvious love interest, if he wasn’t already taken. Like a crushed-down “Love Actually,” “The Holiday” hits familiar beats but keeps the story fresh with its four-hander structure. —AF Tom Burton’s weirder, freakier “Batman” sequel sets a strange psychosexual tale during Gothem’s holiday season, with Christmas ornaments and snow-covered skyscrapers making for a cheery backdrop to Bruce Wayne’s (Michael Keaton) melancholic battle against the villainous Penguin (Danny DeVito). As the vengeful ghoul runs for mayor and hatches a plan to kidnap the children of Gotham’s elite in a twisted Santa Claus plot, Bruce tangos with Catwoman Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) both in and out of their spandex. Their chemistry makes for maybe the sexiest Christmas movie ever made, particularly when Pfeiffer seductively delivers the oh-so cheesy but oh-so-perfect line, “Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. But a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it.” —WC Set in the winter of 1970 and shot to look as if it had actually been made back then, Alexander Payne’s nuanced and hyper-literate “The Holdovers” takes great pleasure in defying every impulse of modern cinema from even before the moment it starts (the studio fanfare includes a “throwback” Focus Features logo, which is a cute little in-joke about a company that wasn’t founded until 2002). And yet, it might take even greater pleasure in embracing some of the movies’ most time-honored tropes and traditions. Chief among them: The inviolable rule that anything a school teacher “casually” tells their students in the first act of a film must speak to a core idea of the film itself. In that light, be sure to take notes during the opening scene in which Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti) quotes Cicero to the “vulgar philistines” in his Ancient Civilization class. “Non nobis solum nati sumus.” “Not for ourselves alone are we born.” No spoilers, but that’s definitely going to be on the final exam of “The Holdovers,” which gradually thaws into a slight but sensitive tale about a trio of lonely souls who teach each other to push through their lives’ most isolating disappointments. —DE Let’s be real: “Gremlins 2” is significantly more fun than its 1984 predecessor. If you don’t already know that in your bones, then you should prioritize seeing the nonseasonal sequel — and possibly its spot-on “Key & Peele” parody — first. That said, “Gremlins” is the holiday half of Joe Dante’s creature duology, and it has more than enough zip to satisfy fans of ’80s camp looking for a quintessential horror holiday. When a traveling salesman (the late Hoyt Axton) brings home a strange new pet for his son, known as a “mogwai,” hero Billy Peltzer (Zach Gilligan) is tasked with abiding by three rules of care: no sunlight, no water, and no feeding it after midnight. Naturally, it takes no time at all for Billy to screw up and unleash the consequences of his adorable Christmas present on his unsuspecting town. “Gremlins” qualifies as top holiday viewing not only because its zany antics take place at Christmas, but because it also includes one of the most baffling beats in “Home Alone” director Chris Columbus’ screenwriting history. Truly, Phoebe Cates’ infamous Santa-in-a-chimney monologue is one tonal mystery that keeps on giving. —AF What do NYPD detective John McClane and classic holiday singer Bing Crosby have in common? They’ll both be home for Christmas. John McTiernan’s “Die Hard” chronicles the ill-fated reunion of Bruce Willis’ starring action hero and his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company’s Christmas party in Los Angeles. McClane’s plans to win his wife back come undone when a high-stakes heist disguised as a terrorist attack takes over the festivities thanks to Alan Rickman’s notorious villain Hans Gruber. At its core, “Die Hard” is a tale of redemption. Sure, he’s not as on-the-nose naughty as the Grinch or Scrooge, but McClane is paying for past mistakes through the hellish ordeal that unfolds before/beneath/beside/above him in an explosive act of absolution. Even more memorable is the story of Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), an LAPD officer whose history on the force motivates the film’s heroic climax. If that worthy Christmas message isn’t reason enough for you to check it out, then trust that the script is full of holiday gems: from saccharine platitudes (“It’s Christmas, Theo! It’s the time of miracles…”) to season’s greetings (“Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!”) —AF Bob Clark’s “A Christmas Story” has a rhythmic familiarity for some families: celebrated each year in an all-day marathon on TBS, seamlessly looping from Ralphie’s initial request for a Red Ryder carbine-action BB gun (that’s the “200-shot, range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time,” of course) to the warm glow of Christmas morning when he discovers whether or not his dream present made it in under the tree. Along the way, Jean Shepherd, who co-wrote the script with Clark and Leigh Brown (not to mention narrates as an older Ralphie), imbues the Parker family with details from his real life, first appearing in his short stories. The road-weary marriage of Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin’s Mrs. and Mr. Parker stands out as a testament to parents pushing to their absolute limits to make Christmas miracles. —AF Not to be confused with its 1994 remake (though the Mara Wilson vehicle does have its moments), 1947’s “Miracle on 34th Street” is the masterwork of writer/director George Seaton that continues to shape how New Yorkers honor the holidays. The black-and-white film stars Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle: the new Santa at a Macy’s department store who shocks the city when he claims to be the real Saint Nick. An 8-year-old Natalie Wood plays Susan: a little girl whose faith in Kringle becomes central to the fairytale’s message. “Miracle on 34th Street” was nominated in multiple categories at that year’s Oscars, including Best Picture. It won three: two for writing and one for Gwenn, who clinched Best Supporting Actor. —AF There are two film adaptations of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” appearing on this list, with many, many more available. And though Brian Henson’s 1992 family favorite ranks lower than its competition, we can confidently say it’s got the better puppets. With Kermit the Frog (performed by Steve Whitmire) as its Bob Cratchit and Michael Caine playing Ebenezer Scrooge, “The Muppet Christmas Carol” stays remarkably close to its Gothic source material: a smart grounding move that heightens the film’s bursts of Muppet parody to among the funniest in the ongoing franchise. Come for the promise of punny characters (Fozziewig!) and catchy musical numbers (“It feels like Chriiistmaaas!”). Stay for the goofy witticisms only the Muppets can do justice: “You’re a little absent-minded, spirit.” “No, I’m a large absent-minded spirit!” —AF The holidays are a time of joy, but they’re also bittersweet. “The Apartment” is one of the great melancholy Christmas films, a movie about being lonely and blue during that confusing period between Christmas and New Year’s. Jack Lemmon stars as meek office drone Baxter, who uses his bachelor pad to get ahead in his career by loaning it out as an affair spot for his married superiors. But when his office crush, elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine, luminous), engages in an affair with the head of the company, he’s forced to reconsider the morals of what he’s doing, and what he really wants out of his life. It’s not the most cheery Christmas film of all time, but its perfectly awkward office holiday party scene and running joke about sending a fruitcake to a person whose heart you broke every December 25 firmly establish it in the sad Christmas canon. —WC The swan song of legendary Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman, “Fanny and Alexander” is an epic in miniature, capturing the lives of two young children born to a wealthy family as they contend with death and abuse but find comfort in themselves and their large extended family. The film, which in its uncut form runs over five hours long, begins with an extended act showcasing the decadent celebrations of the Ekdahl family across Christmas — a relatively secular tradition in which even the Jewish uncle Isak is allowed to partake. The warmth and joy on display (it’s one of the most gorgeous Christmas parties in film history) make the rest of the film — where the siblings’ father dies, and their mother remarries to a severe and abusive Protestant bishop — all the more stark in their cold isolation. Through the contrast between these two methods of religious celebration, “Fanny and Alexander” is one of the few Christmas films to seriously contend with the religion of Christianity itself, asking questions about the role spirituality plays in our lives, and whether it can lead one to happiness or ruin. —WC Its sunny yellow Miami lighting doesn’t scream Christmas. But “Tangerine,” Sean Baker’s breakout film, is very much of the season, taking place entirely on Christmas Eve. The madcap dramedy stars Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as Sin-Dee, a sex worker released from a short jail stint who discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her. Enraged, she recruits her fellow prostitute and friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) to help her find him. The film largely focuses on the two engaging in some very non-Christmas activities, from screaming fights to smoking meth. But their sweet friendship and almost sisterly bond keep the film of the season: if the holidays are about family, then the found family relationship seen in “Tangerine” is one of the best. —WC Satoshi Kon is best known for his mind-bending, meta films like “Paprika” or “Perfect Blue,” movies that toy with ideas of self-perception, delusion, and identity. But between those enigmatic releases, he dropped “Tokyo Godfathers,” a bittersweet tragicomedy Christmas film rooted in the down-and-out lives of ordinary people in modern-day Japan. The result is still one of the most offbeat and unusual Christmas films ever made, and also one of the most heartwarming. Heavily inspired by John Ford’s 1948 Western “3 Godfathers,” “Tokyo Godfathers” moves that story of gunslingers attempting to shepherd a baby to safety to Tokyo, where our heroes are three homeless people who find an abandoned child in the trash on Christmas Eve. Their journey across the city to find the kid’s parents is difficult and alternates between hilarious and sobering, but there’s an affection for these unlikely heroes that shines through the jokes. It’s a lovely look at the unluckiest of people during the season of giving. —WC For even some readers who first encountered the ghostly tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge on the page, the late Scottish actor Alastair Sim is the face of literature’s most famed redemptive protagonist. Directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, this 1951 black-and-white adaptation of “A Christmas Carol” — also known as “Scrooge” — enjoys an otherworldly quality emanating from its now-antiquated filmmaking and Dickens’ illustrious prose: exploring the supernatural side to Christmas in a winding story of a greedy businessman confronting his misdeeds via poltergeist. Sim’s turn as Scrooge sees the seasoned actor dexterously scale the philosophical work’s Jacob’s ladder, guiding the unlikely hero from a horror-esque villain to a soft-smiled man making peace with his life. He’d lead Guy Hamilton’s “An Inspector Calls” as the titular inspector calling just two years later, in 1954. —AF Will Ferrell brings the Christmas spirit and then some in Jon Favreau’s fish-out-of-water (elf-out-of-snow?) 2003 comedy about an effervescent Christmas enthusiast visiting gritty New York City. After spending his entire life with Santa in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf arrives in Manhattan like a breath of syrup/candy/spaghetti-infused air: challenging his nasty Scrooge of an estranged father (the late James Caan) to accept his seemingly boundless love and affection. From picking out an ill-conceived gift for that “special someone” to cutting down a tree in Central Park (a serious and illegal whoopsie!), “Elf” is chockfull of familiar traditions twisted to their most misguided and extreme. It’s a crowdpleaser not just for fans of Ferrell and kids who grew up in the aughts, but anyone needing a reason to enjoy the season. After all, say it with me: “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” —AF “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is often used and recorded as a light, jubilant, or romantic song. But the iconic standard, as introduced by a sprightly Judy Garland in “Meet Me in St. Louis,” is actually a massive downer, a desperate attempt at comfort and happiness during a loved one’s darkest hour. Garland, whose rich voice has never been more beautiful, performs the song in the technicolor Vincente Minnelli musical as hopeless romantic Esther to her little sister Tootie (Margaret O’Brien) after they discover their father will be moving the whole family away from their home. It’s meant to comfort Tootie, but also herself, as she will be ripped away from the boy she loves right after he proposed to her. The scene on Christmas Eve is the only part of “Meet Me in St. Louis” that actually focuses on the holidays, but its perfect blend of melancholy and beauty makes the film an essential entry in the Christmas canon. —WC Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara will knock the breath from your chest in Todd Haynes’ “Carol.” Adapted for the screen by Phyllis Nagy, from Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 “The Price of Salt,” this lesbian period romance (a subgenre done to death, we know) chronicles the swelling attraction between the shop girl/aspiring photographer Therese Belivet and the magnetic soon-to-be divorcee Carol Aird. At first blush, one might clump the women’s love story — featuring clandestine looks framed in artificial snow and an understated meet-cute involving a Santa hat — with other seasonal romances, such as “You’ve Got Mail” or “Love Actually” (also appearing on this list). But where those romantic comedies cut their lovers’ budding tension with holiday antics, “Carol” dares to stare deep into the melancholy thoughtfulness that comes with this time of year by incorporating a heart-rending story of a gay woman fighting to be with her daughter. The result gifts romance fans a slow-burn consideration of the bold futures we choose to allow ourselves and a final shot that will make your heart grow three sizes. —AF It’d be a little cliched to crown director Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life” the best Christmas movie of all time: what with the seemingly endless references and homages to it appearing in other holiday films. And yet, to deny hero George Bailey’s all-time heartbreaker one of the top spots feels just about as nice list-qualifying as denying Santa his cookies. Plus, who really needs to justify giving a James Stewart performance — arguably, his best (though the legendary actor would only win an Oscar for 1940’s “The Philadelphia Story”) — supreme accolades? Based on Philip Van Doren Stern’s “The Greatest Gift,” this 1946 black-and-white fable considers the melancholia and existential despair characteristic for so many at the holidays. When news of a man’s suicidal thoughts reach heaven, Henry Travers’ guardian angel character Clarence Odbody intervenes. For those with a heavy heart this time of year — or any for that matter — “It’s a Wonderful Life” offers a hopeful salve from an old world. —AF It takes a special kind of balding, depressed, zig-zag-wearing kid to anchor not one, not two, but three major holiday specials. Four if you count “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,” “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” and “A Charlie Brown Valentine” (though that last one might be on the fringes of modern popularity and there are other lesser titles we’re not mentioning). After Lucy asks Charlie Brown to direct the Christmas play, he’s thrust into a challenging leadership position that sees him battling Schroeder’s piano and the rest of the gang’s antics for attention. Simultaneously, Linus considers the biblical origins of the holiday and ponders what we owe to one another. The best friends’ journeys meet at night in a cold lot, where Charlie Brown picks out what may very well be the most instantly recognizable Christmas tree in TV and film history. —AF Stanley Kubrick’s final movie is unlike any other of the holly-jolly titles on this list, but there’s no denying the late filmmaker had something to say about Christmas with his sordid tale of a husband and wife’s thorny encounter with an underground sex cult. Finished just days before Kubrick’s death, “Eyes Wide Shut” stars Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a raw nerve of a couple whose growing resentment culminates in a would-be affair spun out of control. Tinsel and lights offer an obvious (and ominously gorgeous) seasonal background for the film, released in July 1999. But it’s Kubrick’s repeated presentation of the holiday’s innate consumerism that drives home his thesis — or at least one interpretation of a thesis! — that marriages and families can be hungrily consumed by the vapid mundanity of self-obsession and competitive capitalism. —AF Not just one of the greatest Christmas rom-coms, but one of the greatest rom-coms period, “The Shop Around the Corner” and its tale of pen pals falling in love during the Christmas season has been adapted and modernized several times, such as in the Broadway musical “She Loves Me” or ’90s email film “You’ve Got Mail.” But Ernst Lubitsch’s original, based on the play “Parfumerie,” remains the greatest telling. In the Budapest leathergoods shop where they work, Klara (Margaret Sullavan) and Alfred (James Stewart) bicker endlessly, but in the anonymous letters they write to each other, they both reveal their softer sides and find themselves smitten with the stranger they don’t know. Both actors are phenomenal, with beautiful simple chemistry that’s alternatively spiky and sweet. They’re supported by a lovely cast, including Frank Morgan as the owner of the store Matuschek who discovers his wife is having an affair. What makes the film such a holiday great is its exploration of lonlieness during the winter months, from the two leads struggling to find love to Matuschek’s despair over his situation. It’s a simple but moving story about finding connection, and how love and companionship can be the greatest gift of all. —WC By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

AST SpaceMobile is hoping to launch a second next-generation prototype satellite "as early as January" as it races to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. The company disclosed the launch timing in a new Federal Communications Commission filing. AST is already on track to launch its first prototype satellite, FM1, later this month. However, it appears that it's also scrambling to launch the FM2 as soon as possible. “As part of its proactive efforts to secure sufficient launches for its satellite constellation on an expedited basis, AST SpaceMobile was able to secure an accelerated launch slot capable of launching a BlueBird satellite as early as January 2026,” the company wrote. Interestingly, AST has tapped rival SpaceX to launch the satellite using a Falcon 9 rocket. But the filing notes: “In order to meet quick turnaround launch requirements, AST SpaceMobile was constrained in the available orbital parameters for launch. The alternative was to forgo the launch opportunity.” The company secured FCC clearance in August to fly up the FM2. However, the "constrained" orbit parameters are leading AST to request regulatory permission to launch the FM2 satellite at a lower orbit, from 520 kilometers down to 460 kilometers. AST describes the lower orbit as part of “a few minor changes” that won’t lead to increased radio interference. “Grant of this application will serve the public interest by facilitating expeditious deployment of a new, groundbreaking space-based cellular network that will deliver direct-to-device broadband connectivity across the United States,” the company added. Still, the company’s application might face opposition from rival companies, such as SpaceX. It could also take time for the FCC to review and clear the application, although the Commission has been working to fast-track satellite approvals. AST’s first prototype, the FM1, is currently scheduled to launch on Dec. 15. The company has tapped India’s space agency to launch the satellite, which is about three times larger than AST's first-generation BlueBirds. The square-shaped satellites have been designed to act as cell towers in space, capable of powering high-speed broadband to phones on the ground. The goal is to operate 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites by the end of next year—enough for the company to provide continuous coverage through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, “AST SpaceMobile expects five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with launches occurring every one to two months on average,” the company told the FCC. Hence, the launch timing is crucial when AST faces heightened competition from SpaceX. The company's own cellular Starlink system launched through T-Mobile earlier this year, and can already power text messaging, app data, and even video calls for phones in cellular dead zones. Now SpaceX is preparing to bulk up the system’s capabilities after acquiring valuable radio spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar. Elon Musk's company has even gone as far as to file the trademark for “Starlink Mobile,” suggesting SpaceX might try to become a global carrier, but primarily through satellites.

Reading time 3 minutes Like the worst sort of father, Xbox doesnât show much care for its youngest consoles anymore, at least judging solely by recent sales data. Black Friday weekend, normally one of the most important for any brand for pre-holiday sales, shows Xbox got beat out by Nintendo, Sony, andâto give the news an ounce of ironyâeven a relatively obscure Kinect-like console. Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at Circana, reported that the PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week console sales, in the U.S. ending Nov. 29. That makes sense, considering the console was on sale for about 40% at some retailers. Sony’s consoleâboth the digital version and one with a disc driveâwas on sale for less than even its pre-hike price. Meanwhile, coming up second was the Nintendo Switch 2 at 24% of total sales. The second-generation handheld console was on sale for $50 off the normally $500 Mario Kart World bundle from Walmart and Amazon. Finally, coming in third was the NEX Playground at 14%. See Xbox Series X and S at Amazon In the US, PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, leading the market. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd (24%), with the NEX Playground 3rd (14%). Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service [image or embed] â Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 6, 2025 at 3:37 PM Whatâs the NEX Playground, you may ask? Itâs an Android-based platform made for younger children. It includes motion sensors that can read body movements for games such as Fruit Ninja or tie-in titles like How to Train Your Dragon: Riders of the Skies. Yes, that’s very much like the long-defunct Kinect. Itâs a very specific kind of console that may make sense for budget-conscious families. Whatâs missing from this pie chart is the Xbox Series S and Series X. Microsoft pushed no sales for its consoles during Black Friday week. Even if some retailers went out of their way to move stock with extra gift cards or game sales, Xbox itself wasnât helping push the needle. The current Xbox Series X costs $650 after this yearâs latest price hike. The same console cost $500 at launch in 2020. Piscatella wrote on Bluesky, âStuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none).â Since the PS5 was the most heavily discounted, it received the lionâs share of additional sales. Xbox either did not think it was necessary to push sales, or the brand just doesnât care anymore. Xboxâs whole strategy is now focused on software. If it does finally release a next-gen Xbox, it will likely be a premium, expensive gaming device made for players who want the very best. That means the Xbox Series consoles donât really have a place anymore. There have been signs that Xbox has been shipping far fewer consoles to retailers, such that Costco removed the companyâs consoles from its U.S. and UK websites. The move toward a software-based gaming ecosystem is inevitably disappointing for Xbox fans. At the same time, the cost of RAM and SSD memory blew past the point of reason several weeks ago, and it keeps getting worse. Burgeoning AI data centers are willing to pay so much for memory that semiconductor companies have created a drought of consumer-ready DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The reliable leaker Mooreâs Law is Dead reported Sony stockpiled enough memory for the short term, but the RAM shortage could last through 2028. Yes, RAM prices could still be out of control a few years from now. Meanwhile, Xboxâs cloud gaming service has reportedly seen an uptick in total usage hours lately. Whether that means there are more people buying into Game Pass is another question entirely. Microsoft hasnât been willing to share total subscriber numbers recently. Thereâs a chance Microsoftâs strategy will win out over the traditionalists like Sony and Nintendo. But for now, its console business is bleeding out so fast, it likely wonât last long. And things aren’t going to get easier for Xbox. Valve is launching its Steam Machine in early 2026 and there will no doubt be all kinds of third-party console-sized PCs of the same ilk.Â When the next-gen Xbox does arrive, it won’t be a battle directly with Sony’s “PS6.” The console wars will have changed by then, with more players fighting for the living room than ever before.

Title: Will Ripple Dump 25% Of Its 45 Billion XRP Holdings Soon? Here’s The 411
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-dump-25-45-billion-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T15:00:08Z

Ripple currently controls a staggering amount of XRP, and now questions from market experts are mounting over whether the crypto payments company may be forced to sell 25% of its 45 billion token holdings. Analysts suggest that a possible selloff could have major implications. At the same time, they question the pathways through which Ripple could sell its holdings and who the potential buyers might be. Ripple may soon need to drastically reduce more than half of its substantial XRP reserves as regulatory discussions over the proposed CLARITY Act intensify. In a recent post on X, market expert Crypto Sensei shared a video, drawing attention to a provision in the CLARITY Act that would prevent any company from controlling more than 20% of a blockchain’s native asset’s total supply. Currently, Ripple owns 45 billion XRP, split between escrow and direct reserve, representing 45% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply of 100 billion tokens. This indicates that the company controls nearly half of the total XRP supply—a level of concentration that typically runs counter to the decentralization narrative of crypto and blockchain technology. Crypto Sensei suggests that US lawmakers are seemingly focused on preventing excessive accumulation of supply, and Ripple’s holdings stand out as one of the clearest examples of a single entity controlling a large portion of a network’s token. According to the analyst, if the CLARITY Act is implemented in 2026, Ripple may need to sell at least 25% of its holdings to comply with the legislation. A reduction of this magnitude would lower the crypto company’s XRP reserves to 20 billion tokens, or 20% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. At the current price of $2.0 per token, this would amount to roughly $40 billion. Notably, such a sell-off would likely require coordination with liquidity providers and partnering institutions to avoid unnecessary market disruption. In his X video, Crypto Sensei outlined several potential paths Ripple could take to reduce its substantial XRP reserves. One option is to sell the rights to future escrow releases instead of the tokens themselves. Another involves selling the accounts into which the escrowed XRP completes while preventing the tokens from circulating. According to the market expert, these possibilities have sparked widespread speculation that major financial players, such as BlackRock, could already be involved or poised to purchase future XRP escrow rights. The idea continues to circulate because it would allow institutions to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without immediately affecting the circulating supply. Crypto Sensei also notes that Ripple locks about 700 million XRP in escrow each month, raising questions about whether these transfers may represent sales. The analyst argues that if sales were occurring, the on-chain trail would clearly show tokens moving to buyers’ wallets, but the data does not reflect this. He highlighted that the current evidence points to a far more controlled internal process rather than large-scale institutional distributions. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: AI Might Be Coming for Your Job. There’s a Proven Way to Prevent That.
URL: https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a69620765/midlife-career-change-entrepreneuralism/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T15:00:00Z

More middle-age and older Americans are becoming entrepreneurs and seizing control of their careers. The leap can be stressful but ultimately rewarding—just listen to the people who’ve already done it. If the rise of artificial intelligence has you feeling anxious about your professional future, you’re not alone. It seems that every day there’s another article painting a doomsday scenario for the white-collar, professional worker, whose job will be transformed or eliminated in this career apocalypse. A recent Wall Street Journal story made this loud and clear with the headline “Walmart CEO Issues Wake-Up Call: AI Is Going to Change Literally Every Job.” The story’s message: AI will wipe out some jobs and reshape the company’s workforce. The article included a quote from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who said the firm is “exiting” employees who can’t be retrained for the AI age. Meanwhile, Accenture will continue to hire people who are fluent in generative AI and retrain existing workers to serve clients in consulting and other divisions. It strikes me that the veiled reference to exiting employees meant those over the age of 50. It gave me déjà vu of when business leaders said the same thing at the dawn of the digital age. It’s ironic that many of the C-suite leaders making such proclamations are themselves older than 50 and have no real tangible experience with AI. During the digital shift, the rush to hire “digiterati” 20-somethings kicked in at full gear. Ultimately, businesses learned younger employees weren’t the cure-all for their digital strategies, as more seasoned employees with years of experience figured out how to evolve business models into the digital age. As a publishing executive who had to navigate the print-to-digital transformation, I was easily “retrained” in my 50s, as were many of my colleagues. As for the companies hiring people who are supposedly fluent in AI, it’s too early in the artificial-intelligence game. No one of any age has accumulated enough knowledge or experience to be true AI natives. But I’m putting my money on older employees who helped navigate the digital age and ultimately became experts. For people in their 50s, corporate careers can be treacherous waters, complete with “downsizing” and “rightsizing,” reorganizations, budget cuts, divisional closures, mergers and acquisitions, the cost of senior talent, and the antiquated idea of mandatory retirement that still exists in certain professions. Now add the glaring headlines that companies like Target, Amazon, Salesforce, IBM, and others are announcing layoffs, many due to the integration of AI into their businesses, resulting in what they say is the need for fewer employees. In other words, the corporate waters seem more treacherous than ever—but there is a proven way to take control of your career before someone else does it for you. If you are in mid-career, now may be the time to rethink your future. It might also be the moment to embrace your inner entrepreneur. According to a 2019 study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, nearly 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were between 55 and 64, almost double from 20 years prior. A 2018 research report from Pierre Azoulay, Ph.D., a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, found that the average age of a successful start-up founder is 45 and that a 50-year-old founder is 1.8 times as likely to have a hit company as people in other age groups. It makes sense. By 50, you’ve likely amassed expertise, industry knowledge, meaningful contacts, and either your own financial resources or access to investment dollars based on your background. There’s not only a growing body of research on midlife entrepreneurialism but also books and real-life examples to serve as a road map. Kerry Hannon, for instance, is an entrepreneur focused on career and retirement strategies; she’s also a speaker and author of several books for those at midlife thinking of making a change. Her book Never Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life is a meaningful playbook, as is Lynne Beverly Strang’s Late-Blooming Entrepreneurs: Eight Principles for Starting a Business After Age 40. A key lesson from these experts is to have a well-thought-out idea that may be an extension of what you’ve done for a living, a new dimension to your background, or an entirely fresh entrepreneurial idea. Matthew Grzybowski, a Polish-born American with a master’s degree in international business who spent nearly two decades in consulting and working for a wealthy European family office, is a prime example of the midlife entrepreneur spirit. When his wife, Veronica, took a sabbatical from her job as a Polish-Korean translator and discovered her love of dog training, it sparked an idea for both of them. As residents of Southampton, New York, they saw a need for a holistic approach to dog care that included daycare, boarding, training, and the requisite spa with bath, blow-dry, brush, and haircut. All their guests get individual walks and playtime, as they relax in the 17 cabanas for the pups. After two years of planning and the decision to self-fund, Southampton Dog opened in late 2024. The business is already profitable, according to the owners. “It’s a place where dogs learn and people connect,” explained Grzybowski, who's pictured at the top of this story. “We have local firefighters and front-page celebrities who are our clients, and we all bond over the dogs.” The cheery 10,000-square-foot facility is the first of what Matthew and Veronica hope will expand to at least three more locations in the next few years. My friend Steve is another excellent example of an entrepreneur in the making. After earning his M.B.A. at UCLA, he worked in entertainment, media, and data-analytics companies. At the age of 51, he was laid off when his company went through yet another reorganization. Ironically, his last assignment was building an AI-strategy road map for his division. At 52, Steve decided he was done with the corporate world, but he still had years of work ahead of him and decided to take the entrepreneurial path. He signed up for the eight-week MIT online course “Leadership in the AI Age: Driving digital transformation for competitive advantage.” His goal is to lean into his years of business experience, adding his new AI knowledge into a practice that advises C-suite executives on ways to adopt AI into their companies, including retraining all their employees, regardless of their age. These stories help to animate a major trend in America, where 21 percent of the population is over 55. According to SCORE, a resource partner of the Small Business Administration, 50.9 percent of small businesses are owned by this group. John Melia, the founder and executive director of the Wounded Warrior Project, who also had a long career in both the nonprofit and for-profit space, became an entrepreneur in his late 50s, launching Contender Equipment Rentals, a veteran-owned construction-equipment-rental company in Texas. “I felt called to build something new from the ground up,” he said. “The idea came from my time in the oil and gas company, where I worked in telematics and sold to rental companies. I realized I had the mindset, the drive, and the operational understanding to start a company of my own.” His advice to anyone over 50 thinking of launching a business is to do it—but do it wisely. Life experience, emotional intelligence, and a strong filter for what matters are important ingredients for success, according to Melia. As life expectancies grow, the idea of retiring at 65 is becoming an outdated concept. If you are that age and healthy, you may live another 30 years. It’s the perfect time to realize that entrepreneurialism has no real age limitations. Luciano Bernardini de Pace had a long career selling advertising in Milan (including for this magazine). In his late 60s, he returned to his hometown in the Puglia region of Italy. There he started an Italian pasta company called Luciano.Market, tapping his media background to spread the word digitally, including videos on YouTube and TikTok. He also restored a palazzo in Bagnolo del Salento, renamed Palazzo Bernardini de Pace, a luxury mansion that he has turned into a boutique hotel. According to Bernardini de Pace, he never really thought about his age. He had an idea that he was passionate about and took the risk. For David Harrison, it was his age that led him to entrepreneurism. As a United Airlines international first officer pilot on the 787 Dreamliner, he is required to retire at 65. His entrepreneurial leap has been to go back to school to earn a master’s degree in wealth management at Columbia University’s School for Professional Studies. It’s a 16-month asynchronous program with two residencies, ideal for his globe-trotting schedule. His pivot will be to support his community, family, and friends as a wealth advisor. “I want to be able to help people achieve their life goals, not just their financial goals,” he said. According to the Wall Street Journal story “The New Age of Entrepreneurship: 70 to 79,” the entrepreneurial urge doesn’t necessarily diminish with age. The article included a profile of 71-year-old Judson Vaughn, who partnered with a 77-year-old to create online courses to teach lawyers how to be entertaining as well as effective. Alan Patricof is perhaps the ultimate role model for a late-in-life renaissance. A seasoned Wall Street executive and investor philanthropist, he has been a serial entrepreneur his whole adult life. In his early 80s, he founded Primetime Partners with Abby Levy. In his mid-80s, he became a first-time author, writing No Red Light about his career in venture capital and more. At 88, he was the oldest participant in the New York City Marathon in 2022. A year later, he got remarried. Becoming an entrepreneur at midlife can be both exhilarating and challenging, but for most who have taken the leap, they often ask, “What took me so long?” If the AI revolution is coming after your job, now might be the time to get ahead of it with your own entrepreneurial idea. And yes, you may have to integrate AI into your own business, but there is a big distinction. At least you’ll own your company and never have to worry about that meeting with your boss when you enter the room and the human-resources person is sitting there too.

Title: Former teacher jailed for indecent assault of young boys

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent A former maths teacher at a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin has been jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Kelly was a teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock for almost 30 years. The 73-year-old was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 28 counts of indecent assault. One man told the court that Kelly was "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse" at Willow Park and secondary school, Blackrock College. Kelly began teaching at Willow Park primary school in 1977. He resigned in 2004 after an investigation following a complaint made in 2001. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute him at that stage. However, earlier this year, he went on trial at the Circuit Criminal Court, charged with 28 counts of indecent assault against eight boys. All were aged between around 10 and 13 when the assaults took place. Some of the offences took place in the classroom and some in changing rooms. Kelly denied the charges but was convicted by a jury last month. The court heard that he does not accept the verdicts. Many of the boys gave evidence that Kelly wore a black gown and would put them under his gown and cuddle and fondle them - something he referred to as "The Muppet Show". He would also tickle boys, calling it "death by tickles", slap them, bounce them on his crotch and touch their genital areas or make them touch his. The boys also gave evidence of physical punishment, although this did not form part of the charges against Kelly. However, the prosecution case was that he used physical and sexual violence to demean the boys in his class. The boys are now men in their 50s and the court heard emotional and moving victim impact statements from all eight of them. Most described suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Some had struggled with addiction and lived with self doubt, fear, depression and anxiety. Judge notes bravery of men In her sentencing remarks, Judge Elma Sheahan said she was struck by the bravery of the men. She said they had to bare their souls in front of their families and strangers, and she was struck by the eloquent expression of their very real and ongoing hurt and torment. The judge noted the damage done to the men as well as the intergenerational hurt caused to the men's partners and children. She said they had waited for decades to tell their stories and to be believed. Judge Sheahan said their families may not have understood at the time why they behaved a certain way as young boys - withdrawing, refusing to attend school and even moving abroad. She said the worry and upset caused to those close to the victims was another aspect of the harm done. The judge pointed out that it was not just the young age of the boys which made them vulnerable. She said some of them were already traumatised from the loss of a parent, or from more severe abuse at the hands of other teachers at Willow Park. The judge said she noted the further hurt caused to some of his victims in comments that he made during his evidence to his trial. She said this was very unfortunate, but was ultimately rejected by the jury. Judge Sheahan said the gravity of the offending was significant. She said the aggravating factors were the seriousness of the offending, Kelly’s position in the boys' lives, the breach of trust, the age disparity, the repetitive nature of the offending and the number of children abused. Other aggravating factors, the judge said, were the vulnerability of the children and the fact that some of the offending took place in the classroom in front of their peers. In mitigation, she said she took into consideration the lack of previous convictions, as well as Kelly’s age and ill health. The judge was told that he suffers from a number of physical and psychological issues, including metastatic prostate cancer. She said she noted a testimonial by Kelly’s brother in relation to his efforts to help those in need in his community. Most of the offences carried a maximum sentence of ten years although some carried a maximum of two years because of the dates on which they were committed. Judge Sheahan said "having stood back" and looked at the case in its entirety, she would impose a total sentence of ten years in prison. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former Willow Park teacher jailed for ten years over indecent assault of eight boys
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/08/former-willow-park-teacher-jailed-for-ten-years-over-indecent-assault-of-eight-boys/

Full Content:
A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin has been jailed for a total term of ten years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago. Because Peter Kelly (73), who grew up and lived all his life in Booterstown, did not accept the verdict of a jury at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that he was guilty of 28 counts of indecent assault, there was “no basis” to suspend any of the ten-year term, Judge Elma Sheahan said. She was impressed by the bravery of the eight survivors, who had to “bare their souls” in victim impact statements, and the eloquent expression of their “very real hurt and torment”. All eight were “already vulnerable children” at the time of the offences. They had suffered real trauma, whether as the result of the death of a parent or abuse by another person. Four had been abused by another person at the school, she noted. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, they suffered “real damage”, including addiction in some cases, psychological injury and inter-generational trauma. They had “waited for decades” to tell their stories and to be believed and had suffered hurt due to lack of understanding about why they behaved in certain ways, including withdrawal, addiction and even moving abroad. The court also acknowledged the “brutal” nature of the trial process. The accused was entitled to have the State prove its case, but that could cause further hurt by comments made during the process, which were ultimately rejected by the jury. The aggravating factors were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused, the breach of trust, age disparity, repetitive nature of the offending, number of children involved, their vulnerability due to age and their own personal circumstances and the fact some of his offending was done in front of their peers, causing shame and embarrassment, the judge said. In mitigation, the judge took into account Kelly has no previous convictions and that his time in custody will be more difficult because of that and his age. She also noted his significant physical frailties and ill health, including prostate cancer, eye and kidney problems, and an anxiety disorder; efforts to help people in need in his community and his long history of employment. The single greatest mitigating factor in a case is a guilty plea but that was not available here and he did not accept the jury verdict, she said. The judge said there are different ranges of offending into which offences of indecent and sexual assault fall and the fact that two year and ten year maximum sentences applied to some of the offences reflected those changes. It is “profoundly degrading” for any person to be subject to any sexual assault and all sexual assaults are serious, she said. She imposed sentences ranging from 20 months to years in relation to each complainant and made some of those consecutive and some concurrent. After saying sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender, she impose a global total sentence of ten years. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” the judge concluded. Kelly, who taught at Willow Park primary school from 1977 until 2004, was convicted last month of 28 counts of indecently assaulting the eight boys on various dates in the 1970s and the 1980s at the school. The school was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans, and one of the eight survivors of Kelly’s abuse told the court his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse,” the man said. “We as children had no chance.” All eight complainants, who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences, read or provided victim impact statements to the court last week. Six complainants attended court to read their statements while the remaining two statements were read by Inspector Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what he called the ‘Muppet Show’ in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly also pulled some complainants onto his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse. Some complainants suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation.

December 08, 2025 09:20 ET | Source: Intercont Cayman Intercont Cayman HONG KONG, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intercont (Cayman) Limited (Nasdaq: NCT)(“NCT” or “the Group”), a global carbon-neutral shipping company, announced that, it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to acquire a less than 50% minority stake of Starks Network Ltd (“Starks Network” or “the Company”) , a leading Singapore-based Web3 technology service provider and will co-develop the Project zCloak Network (“zCloak”). This strategic agreement marks a signiﬁcant milestone, positioning NCT and zCloak to jointly advance the integration of maritime services and blockchain technology. Starks Network, incorporated in the Cayman Islands with operational headquarters in Singapore, has established strong competitive advantages in the global Web3 ecosystem with Project zCloak Network. The company’s proprietary frameworks and compliance-forward infrastructure span AI identity, enterprise self-custodial wallets, stablecoin payment systems, and AI-powered crypto payment technologies. These differentiated capabilities create substantial barriers to entry and have earned zCloak grant by ofﬁcial Hong Kong Cyberport incubation programs, as well as investments from top-tier venture capital ﬁrms including Coinbase Ventures. zCloak is widely regarded as a high-growth technology leader with robust investor support. zCloak Network Vision The global adoption of stablecoin-based payment systems has accelerated rapidly. With the static by Stablecoin Insider, worldwide stablecoin transaction volume has surpassed the combined annual processing volume of Visa and Mastercard in 2024—an inﬂection point signaling stablecoins’ emergence as critical ﬁnancial infrastructure.[1] Meanwhile, McKinsey points out the growth rate of stablecoin transaction is in accelerating tendency and could surpass legacy payment volumes in less than a decade. On that basis, as on-chain payment matures, institutional and enterprise clients continue to demonstrate strong demand for secure, extensible, and compliant wallet solutions.[2] BlackRock reported $13.46 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in Q3 2025, underscoring the early participation of major financial institutions.[3] Meanwhile, the overall digital asset market capitalization surged from $5 billion in 2022 to over $25.5 billion by July 2025, representing growth of approximately 410%.[4] As digital assets become a central driver of innovation in global finance, governments and financial institutions worldwide are racing to establish strategic footholds. Bitcoin image NCT’s planned acquisition of zCloak represents a decisive step in its long-term strategy to expand into the digitization of real-world assets while reinforcing its leadership in global shipping services. The company will explore diversified pathways for tokenizing real-world assets across industries, leveraging zCloak’s technical infrastructure to deliver standardized, compliant, and scale up on-chain asset solutions. Together, both the NCT and Starks Network aim to accelerate enterprise adoption of Web3 technologies worldwide. Ms. Muchun Zhu, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of NCT, and Dr. Xiao Zhang, Founder of Starks Network and zCloak, described this partnership as a bold convergence of tradition and innovation: “Four hundred years after Shakespeare, the Merchant of Venice sails again — on-chain.” Through this collaboration, timeless themes of contract, wealth, humanity, and justice will be re-imagined using Web3 technology. Ms. Zhu added: “The markets zCloak operates in are already producing meaningful commercial outcomes. In privacy-preserving identity, compliance verification, and confidential computation, leading infrastructure providers routinely achieve the US$30–40 million annual revenue range, driven by institutional adoption and high-margin enterprise integration. We see a similar structural demand forming around zCloak’s technology. Our acquisition positions NCT to participate in these high-value verticals. While this does not represent a projection of future performance, it illustrates the exponential revenue potential associated with the infrastructure layer we are now building. We believe zCloak gives us a credible entry point into a rapidly expanding market, and we intend to execute aggressively.” About Intercont (Cayman) Limited Intercont (Cayman) Limited is a global shipping enterprise with plans for seaborne pulping operations.

Title: BlackRock Files for Staked Ethereum ETF

Time Published: 2025-12-08T13:54:22Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has officially filed for a staked Ethereum ETH$3,350.62 exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to the masses. The world’s largest asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. SEC on Friday. The filing kicks off the review process, but to trigger a formal deadline for SEC approval or denial, the fund’s listing exchange must still submit a separate 19b-4 form. The proposed fund, called the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), was first hinted at in November when BlackRock registered the name in Delaware. That move signaled intent but didn't count as a formal application with the SEC. This isn’t BlackRock’s first Ethereum ETF. The firm launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024 alongside other issuers. But at the time, the SEC—then led by Chair Gary Gensler—reportedly instructed firms to strip out staking components from their filings. The agency had previously argued that staking services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase could constitute unregistered securities offerings. Under new Chair Paul Atkins, that position appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck are now among several issuers resubmitting or amending ETF filings to include staking. While others are modifying their existing products, BlackRock opted to launch an entirely new fund. ETHA, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking version. The staked fund, if approved, would give investors exposure to Ethereum’s yield-generating mechanism without having to stake assets themselves.

Share this article BlackRock plans to stake most of its Ethereum holdings through a new exchange-traded fund structure, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF seeks to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings under normal market circumstances, the filing shows. The product will hold Ethereum and distribute staking rewards, minus fees, to shareholders at least quarterly. The trust will use third-party staking service providers selected by the Ether Custodian to operate validators. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the primary custodian, while Anchorage Digital Bank has been added as an alternative custodian. The trust may reduce staking if the sponsor determines the activity raises regulatory concerns or risks the trust’s grantor trust tax status. Shares will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ETHB.

Title: Netflix needs Warner Bros.’s IP and franchises to remain the default streaming service

Good morning. There’s a lot of debate over last week’s surprise announcement that Netflix struck an $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. President Donald Trump said Sunday that their combined market share “could be a problem,” and the deal will face international scrutiny, too. Some takeaways so far: Warner Bros. held out for a bigger shared win. An insider told me that Warner Bros. chief David Zaslav was not eager to partner with Paramount Skydance because of financing, the price, and the fact that rookie CEO David Ellison would not only retain controlling shares but was still digesting his last win. Activate Consulting CEO Michael J. Wolf, a veteran media consultant and former president of MTV Networks, argues that this deal is a must-do for Netflix, given the rising strength of competitors like YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi. “No doubt Netflix is the default streaming service,” Wolf told me over the weekend. “Going forward, what will be required to win is more iconic IP and more global franchises that work everywhere. Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the only companies out there that will give Netflix both of these at once.” Experience matters. Content and the ability to distribute it have fueled many an entertainment merger. But history is filled with examples of those who’ve generated huge value for stakeholders from such deals and many that did not. The AOL Time Warner merger proved to be an expensive cautionary tale about clashing cultures, mistimed market shifts and the perils of buying at peak bubble. (Time Warner’s Turner acquisition, on the other hand, was a home run.) I remember GE CEO Jeff Immelt telling me “we know this world” when merging VivendiUniversal and NBC. Turns out GE didn’t create as much value as NBC Universal’s subsequent buyer Comcast did. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is right to say that “our mission has always been to entertain.” But even if he overcomes antitrust scrutiny, he must then win over Hollywood, investors and consumers who already balk at the idea of this new behemoth. AI is changing the game. We’ve already seen how much AI is changing the entertainment game, with AI-generated actor Tilly Norwood, AI influencers, Coca-Cola commercials, and movies. Since Netflix is a longtime builder—versus a buyer—some wonder if the streamer is interested in Warner Bros.’ deep library for reasons other than simply giving consumers more stuff to consume. As Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told Fortune, the future of entertainment may come down to who owns what she calls “the video corpus” to train and power the next generation of AI models. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com China’s $1 trillion trade surplus President Trump’s tariffs weren’t enough to rein in China’s exports. The country’s trade surplus blew past $1 trillion for the first time this year, with one month to spare. China’s exports to the U.S. have plummeted, falling 29% in November year-on-year, but shipments to other countries, especially in southeast Asia, have soared, making up the difference. IBM’s big AI deal IBM is reportedly in talks to buy Confluent, a company that manages real-time flow of data in big AI models, in a deal worth $11 billion. The acquisition would be IBM’s largest in recent years; the tech giant announced it was slashing thousands of jobs in November in a shift towards AI. Apple’s C-Suite shakeup Four Apple executives who report to CEO Tim Cook have stepped down in the past week, marking a major shakeup at the tech giant known for C-Suite stability that’s hampering its effort to catch up in the AI race. Deutsche Bank pay bump Deutsche Bank wants to boost the pay of its supervisory board chair, Alexander Wynaendts, who is already the highest-paid chair in Germany’s Dax 40 companies. Germany’s largest lender will ask shareholders to approve a 47% bump for Wynaendts, which will take his pay to roughly $1.6 million. Rate cut expectations Wall Street analysts expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to announce another rate cut following the central bank’s meeting this week but to hold off on signaling a January cut as he balances dovish and hawkish committee members. Bank of America analysts wrote on Friday that Powell will have a hard time sending “a credibly hawkish signal” as important jobs and consumer data will be released between this week’s meeting and the one in January. China’s newest AI billionaire A homegrown Chinese chipmaker, Moore Threads Technology Co., staged China’s second-largest IPO of the year on Friday, raising $1.1 billion. Its stock rocketed 425% in its Shanghai debut, making co-founder Zhang Jianzhong, an ex-Nvidia executive, a billionaire and giving momentum to China’s push for chip self-sufficiency. Moving on from the Metaverse Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is leaving the Metaverse behind as the company announced it is cutting 30% from the budget of the lab responsible for the project, per Bloomberg. The experiment that Zuckerberg once described as the “successor to the mobile internet” has accumulated $70 billion in losses since 2021. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning. The last session closed up 0.19%. STOXX Europe 600 was flat in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.08% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.18%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.81%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 1.34%. India’s NIFTY 50 is down 0.86%. Bitcoin is up at $92K.

Title: I was an ambitious Amazon exec who solved my burnout without skipping a beat at work. Here's how.

It was Friday afternoon, and I'd just hit send on my weekly report to Amazon's Retail vice presidents, detailing what the Global Merchandising team I'd created had accomplished that week. I was 38, and the role — which oversaw standards, best practices, and technology for Amazon's 200+ site merchandisers — was the biggest of my life by far, one I'd been thrust into just three months after my arrival in Seattle and at Amazon. I was thrilled (and a bit terrified) by the size of the opportunity, and threw myself into it. Two years in, my team had 18 sizable projects underway. We accomplished so much that documenting our progress in that weekly email took me hours — and yet in two years, I'd rarely received so much as a "thx" in return. "At Amazon, silence from the top means you're doing a good job," a colleague reminded me, with rueful humor. She was right. But the feedback vacuum made it increasingly difficult to know if I was fulfilling my mandate. Was I moving fast enough? Still aligned with their priorities? Anxiety filled the void. I pushed myself and my team harder and took on even more. This is the first installment of Business Insider's five-part series, The Burnout Cure, which examines how people recognize burnout, confront it, and rebuild their lives on the other side. I'd once been someone with passions — yoga, reading, arthouse movies — but all of that had faded. When I did find time for something I enjoyed, I was distracted, worried that I'd miss an urgent email. It felt easier to stay vigilant at all times. As I stared at my email that day, I thought, None of this actually matters — followed by the sense that I had to keep pushing forward anyway. That if I slowed down even a little, my career would collapse. Later in the parking garage, I stared numbly at the car in front of me when it hit me: Is this what burnout feels like? It was. I just hadn't realized it could happen to me. I was a naturally driven person who liked being busy; I thought burnout was for the weak. And at work, it was hard to distinguish between burning out and just keeping up. In school and at other jobs, I'd often wished that other people would think bigger and move faster; now I was surrounded by smart, fun, driven coworkers on that same wavelength. I rarely had a moment of boredom at Amazon, and I loved that. But there was a dark side. Add in scarce resources, time pressure, and our inability to say no — to our bosses, to each other, and to ourselves — it was a recipe for exhaustion. I'd been raised to believe I could do anything if I only tried hard enough. That worked out pretty well when it was roller skating or long division, but it started to work against me by high school. When I earned my first Cs, I saw it as a failure of willpower, not a sign that I had strengths and weaknesses like any other human. I carried that harsh self-judgment through college and grad school and into the working world. My version of self-care was drinking white wine and shopping, which often drained me further. When it dawned on me that I was burned out, I was finally able to face it. And over the next months, without ever saying a word about burnout to my boss or co-workers, I slowly pulled myself back to health. Here's what I did to get there. Shopping is fun, but what I really needed were things like sleep and food. I started reading novels before bed instead of emails. I made a point of eating lunch every day, even if it was at my desk. Occasionally, I snuck out for a short walk around the block. The views and movement left me calmer. I waited for my gentler lifestyle to blow up in my face — all that time working at a frantic pace had convinced me that slowing down would backfire terribly. But nothing happened. It didn't seem like anyone at work even noticed, though my husband and dog did, and I even passed the occasional coworker on a walk outside the building. The stories I'd told myself about being "found out" hadn't been based in reality. I couldn't change Amazon's culture of overwork, but I could dial back some of the work I volunteered for to be helpful and prove my worth. I was someone who'd rarely turned down ad hoc committees or mentorship requests, especially when it could help elevate women. But those "after-school" assignments did little to advance my career. At performance review time, all that really mattered was what I'd done to grow the business. I decided that unless an opportunity offered a clear benefit not just to Amazon but to me —or unless it was important to my boss, whom I trusted — I'd turn it down. I felt like a selfish jerk at first, but once again, the sky didn't fall. People simply moved to the next candidate on the list. When I did say yes, I was more engaged and effective, sitting in hiring loops for teams I was curious about and joining occasional projects to work alongside former colleagues. Fun counts as a benefit, and pleasure helps cure burnout. A day where I laughed a lot, did work that fascinated me, or simply learned something new was a day where I got something instead of just giving. A fear of embarrassment or failure at work meant I was always ready with a fast response to any executive's question, but it also kept me from challenging myself in new ways. To keep stakes low, I began looking for modest challenges outside work that I could squeeze into small pockets of time, like learning to solve British-style crosswords or making a soufflé. Later, I added Italian lessons, trained for a half-marathon, and joined the board of a local nonprofit serving prison inmates. My "electives," as I thought of them, became a safe place to make and learn from rookie errors, reminding me that being a beginner is exhilarating — and that I was more than just my job. I found a therapist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy who showed me how to distinguish between passing thoughts and objective reality. When I thought, "If I say no to this project, someone will think I'm lazy," I learned to ask questions: Did I have evidence of that happening in the past? How about evidence of saying no and still being respected? If someone did think I was lazy, how might I cope? What would I say to a friend with the same worry? I still experienced panicky feelings, but I stopped mistaking them for facts. My comeback from burnout was imperfect and sometimes halting. At times, it scared me to feel calm and well, so I'd dive back into frantic overwork — only to learn all over again that I wasn't more effective that way, just busier. I never worked up the courage to talk to my managers or peers about burnout, even though signs of it were everywhere. In a culture where exhaustion and overwork were worn as badges of honor, I feared that even broaching the topic would mark me as lazy or weak. As a leader, I wish I'd had the courage to push for a broader dialogue about burnout, but I also understand why it didn't feel safe. In an era of mass layoffs, I hear from tech workers who feel pushed to work harder and longer than ever before to avoid losing their jobs. They know they need to pull back, but they're afraid. I have two pieces of advice for people in that situation. The first is to recognize that pushing through burnout won't make you better at your job. The numb, frightened, sleepless version of you can't fire on all cylinders, which could put your job at risk. Prioritizing your own basic needs can be scary, but it's critical. Second, understand that small steps matter. Maybe you're not in a position to turn down extra assignments; maybe the thought of adding an Italian class or half-marathon to your life makes you laugh hysterically to keep from crying. But you can make sure to eat lunch. You can carve out a three-minute breathing space to calm your nervous system. (No one can find you in a restroom stall.) You can run modest experiments, like closing your email after a certain time in the evening, just to see how it goes. Pick something to try, and once it becomes a habit, add something else. The benefits will slowly accumulate, and you'll begin to recognize yourself again. Amazon did not provide a comment for this story. Kristi Coulter spent 12 years at Amazon and left in 2018.

Title: The Defining Artworks of 2025

By Francesca Aton, Brian Boucher, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, Emily Watlington December 8, 2025 5:00am By some measures, democracy is in downward decline in quite a few countries across the world, while censorship is only increasing. (A coincidence? Hardly.) But even with so much valid concern about the fragility of the world order more broadly, artists pressed ahead in 2025, producing valuable works that contended with police violence, abuses of power, fallen monuments, climate change, and trans rights. This list taking stock of the 25 artworks that defined the year includes many pieces confronting these issues. Not every work here is a protest, of course; there are also pieces that conjure science-fictional worlds and new possibilities for abstraction. (Not every artwork is even particularly great—we’ve included one piece we really didn’t like but found significant nonetheless.) But in a time when freedom of expression is under threat, just about any kind of art feels political in its own way. This list is a reminder that artists can, and will, forge onward, even in the darkest moments. It’s also a reminder that artists did just that in the past, too. To complement the new and recent artworks featured here, we’ve also roped in some older pieces that speak well to our current mood. These works show that history is unsettled—particularly at a time when some political forces would prefer for the past to remain set in stone. —Alex Greenberger We loved Adrien Brody in The Pianist (2002) and The Brutalist (2024), but “the artist” is a role he is unable to master, judging by the ridiculously bad, overdetermined products on view in his summer show “Made in America,” in which he portrayed iconic characters like Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe, who artists great (Warhol) and not-so-great (KAWS, Banksy) have long since worked with. But the show was seemingly all anyone could talk about. In another great movie, The Matrix (1999), when Joe Pantoliano’s character is going to be plugged back into the fake world, he says, “I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.” But even some actors, with all their money and fame, deep down, just want to be artists. Is that at least something that artists can feel good about? —Brian Boucher As hysteria over AI reached a fever pitch this year, artists began tackling the technology’s implications in refreshingly off-kilter ways. Shanghai-born, Tokyo-based artist Lu Yang is a case in point. Though the artist has been creating videos, installations, and interactive works featuring his virtual avatar Doku since 2020, this year Yang debuted a new installation, DOKU the Creator, that became the talk of Art Basel Hong Kong. (It later traveled in a modified form to the Amant art space in Brooklyn.) The piece is a sensory overload of an installation anchored by an hour-long video in which Doku moves through a surreal dreamscape that blends video game animation with AI-generated imagery. In Hong Kong, the video was presented inside an interactive installation that included a pop-up store. Works were sold in “blind boxes,” each hiding one of 108 possible pieces—a setup that laid bare the casino-like nature of the art market. The video and its surrounding environment evoke an art world in which the artist is no longer essential to the system’s functioning. Doku appears to operate autonomously, free to create, destroy, and mourn the value of art without any mediation by its creator. What distinguishes Yang’s work from other AI critiques is that he seems unbothered by this state of affairs. Drawing on Buddhist philosophy, he suggests that all creation functions like an algorithm—endlessly combining and recombining the totality of human thought and creativity into conceptual forms. Our mistake, he implies, is in attaching too much meaning to the artist, or their originality, at all. In the end, they are all temporary illusions. —Harrison Jacobs Surrealism—which just celebrated its 100th anniversary—is having a moment even as its canon grows ever more inclusive, with rising auction prices for Surrealist works by women, a run of expansive institutional shows like 2022’s “Surrealism Beyond Borders,” and growing interest in formerly underknown figures such as Les Lalanne. A case in point is the Museum of Modern Art’s current Wifredo Lam retrospective, on view through April 11, which presents the Cuban Surrealist painter as a transformative figure rather than an exotic offshoot of a primarily European movement. Of Chinese and African descent, Lam was deliberate about using Afro-Caribbean imagery in his works, famously telling art historian Gerardo Mosquera that his art was “an act of decolonization.” A highlight of MoMA’s exhibition is Lam’s painting Grande Composition (1949), which features a hybrid horse-human taken from the African diasporic religion Santería. The work epitomizes Lam’s belief in what he told Mosquera was “the importance of bringing the Black presence into art.”—Anne Doran Invited to create a work for the Guggenheim’s 1963 Pop Art exhibition “Six Painters and the Object,” artist Harold Stevenson produced The New Adam, a 40-foot-long wraparound painting of a nude man. (Actor Sal Mineo was the model for the body; the partially obscured face is that of Stevenson’s lover at the time, British aristocrat Timothy Willoughby.) It was rejected by the show’s curator Lawrence Alloway, who wrote, “[The] problem . . . is publicity, rumor, and all those entertaining things which would go along with exhibiting a nude with a phallus the size of a man.” More than 60 years later the time finally seems right for Stevenson’s gargantuan canvas, which not only celebrates the male body but expresses homosexual desire at a scale impossible to ignore. It is currently on view through January 19 in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s exhibition “Sixties Surreal.” —Anne Doran Few works in 2025 carried the cultural and political weight of Un coro de yicas (A chorus of yicas), the centerpiece of Claudia Alarcón and Silät’s exhibition at James Cohan. The installation—composed of 100 hand-woven yica bags—made visible a lineage of Wichí women whose textile knowledge has been passed down by generations and until recently dismissed as craft. Each yica is made using chaguar fibers harvested, processed, spun, dyed, and woven through a communal, intergenerational labor system that Alarcón learned at age 12. The work crystallizes what their practice represents: not formalist abstraction but a living language, a structure of communication, memory, and autonomy passed from mothers to daughters across the Alto la Sierra and La Puntana communities in Argentina. Seen together, the 100 bags operate as both archive and chorus, a collective declaration of presence at a moment when Indigenous women’s labor is finally being recognized as contemporary art. —Daniel Cassady This mixed-media sculpture by Ser Serpas featured in the MoMA PS1 exhibition “The Gatherers,” which brought together the work of artists whose practices collect and accumulate various forms of detritus in a world that is increasingly wasteful and on the brink of environmental collapse. Serpas is one such young artist who has injected new energy into this form of assemblage. Her installation, titled tube of brief cadavers made sadder still, might on its surface resemble a trash heap at a dump, but the two main items juxtaposed together—a plastic orange saddle-like contraption that could be part of a boat, and shredded silver fabric recalling emergency blankets—lend the piece a connotation of migrants fleeing by sea. Its haunting title seems to confirm that allusion, memorializing those who do not make the crossing and, more recently, those who are being targeted in such boats. —Maximilíano Durón The history of Japanese internment—when the United States government detained and imprisoned its own citizens—never seems to loom as large within American consciousness as it should. Perhaps that might change with Bruce Yonemoto’s Broken Fences, which debuted in the Hammer Museum’s “Made in L.A.” biennial this year, where it emerged as one of the show’s standouts. For the piece, Yonemoto has constructed two fence-like armatures into which he has embedded video screens. On the screens play two sets of propaganda—sometimes side by side, sometimes separately: one produced by the U.S. War Relocation Authority documenting the deportation of Japanese Americans, and one created by the Nazis about the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Both falsely promote the supposed “benefits” of these detentions. (The work’s dominating audio, however, comes from the German propaganda film.) Yonemoto poignantly underscores how two opposing wartime powers deployed strikingly similar visual and rhetorical tools, drawing a chilling parallel between their methods and the ideologies they served.—Maximilíano Durón More so than any other artist this year, South Korean phenom Ayoung Kim took the American art press by storm, with her work appearing on the cover of simultaneous issues of Artforum and Frieze this fall. (ARTnews also profiled her around that time, too.) There’s good reason to be suspicious of any artist who receives so much attention so suddenly, but Kim is the real deal, as proven by her current MoMA PS1 exhibition and a Performa commission staged this past November. The centerpiece of her PS1 show is this video installation, one of three chapters in a trilogy of works about motorcycle-riding female delivery workers who seem to attract and antagonize each other. Projected onto three formidably sized screens that hang from the ceiling, Kim’s footage switches seamlessly between imagery made using gaming engines and AI, and often displays impossibly tall ramps and staircases in futuristic worlds. Those worlds may not look ours, but the workers who scale them are navigating a capitalistic rat race that feels a lot like the one of the present. —Alex Greenberger The mercurial pop-music star Lorde tapped the art world in a number of ways in the promotional push around her fourth studio album Virgin, including a video that alluded to Walter De Maria’s seminal Land art work The New York Earth Room and, in a booklet that accompanied the vinyl LP, a bare-it-all picture of a waist in see-through pants by photographer Talia Chetrit. But the cover of the album was the master stroke: an X-ray image of a pelvis by Heji Shin. Bones in the arresting image are joined by a zipper (the same one as in the pants in Chetrit’s photo?) and an IUD. —Andy Battaglia This one’s very meta. When climate protestors threw soup on Van Gogh’s sunflowers and mashed potatoes on Monet’s haystacks, their detractors decried defacing any art. Never mind that all their targets were protected with plexiglas, a veneer made from fossil fuels poetically shielding these human-produced views of nature, which apparently seemed more precious to some than nature itself. Beyond the ragebait headlines, the boring moralist should-they-or-shouldn’t-theys, the protestors’ gesture blurred protest and art in more ways than one. A series by Goldin+Senneby honors the Just Stop Oil group’s conceptual heft while turning cries of conservation on their head. Working with professional conservators, the duo meticulously recreated each splattered plexi vitrine to scale, showing them against blank walls and turning them into paintings themselves. You can bask in their irreverent glory at the MIT List Visual Arts Center, where I first saw them, through mid-March. —Emily Watlington This is a game: Move your mouse across a digital landscape, select your drone’s target, press “X” for death. In Domestic Tension, Iraqi American artist Wafaa Bilal argues that this is the numbing ease of modern warfare—where the distance between people and their would-be killers has been so thoroughly abstracted that devastation can be delivered from an office chair. The piece stands as an example of what Bilal has called a “networked performance.” He confined himself to a Chicago gallery for its duration, broadcasting live online 24/7 and inviting viewers to chat, observe, or—if they were so mysteriously compelled—shoot him with a robotically-controlled paintball gun. (Non-lethal bullets still hurt.) Domestic Tension simulated the unending anxiety faced by Iraqis worldwide, forced to anticipate violence—whether physical, like a US-made bomb, or existential, as the so-called War on Terror legitimized racism: it’s acceptable to fire, so long as the target is Arab. —Tessa Solomon On most days, David Zwirner’s townhouse on New York’s Upper East Side functions well as a domestic space converted into white-cube gallery, but during the run of P. Staff’s remarkable show there this fall, the building’s spiral staircase was occasionally drenched in a haunting shades of blue. The source of that emanation was Penetration, a video projected across all three of the gallery’s floors, in which a figure stands stoically in a darkened space. A laser beam shoots through the void, aimed directly at this person’s stomach. What did that mean? Never one to let viewers off the hook easily, Staff did not offer many clues, though those familiar with the artist’s past work might recognize in this video a statement on the surveillance of bodies that do not conform to conservative gender norms. That kind of violence is endemic right now in the US—the Trump administration recently announced a measure that would keep trans Americans from changing their gender on their passports—but Staff notably did not explicitly portray it. Sometimes, everyday life is scary enough. —Alex Greenberger The trend of women painting women and calling it “feminist” has been brewing for some time, but it exploded this autumn in what I dubbed “feminist figuration fall.” Yet there is a clear divide between work trafficking in—and profiting from—pastiche and normative fantasy, and those building new, feminist worlds. Amid it all, Gordon’s show at David Zwirner stood out. In this particular painting, luminous skin glows eerily green and is punctuated with cellulite and stretch marks. Meanwhile, each of our subject’s long hairs are rendered individually. Gordon stands naked in this self-portrait save for a pair of black kitten heels, not just echoing Manet’s Olympia but talking back to it. The work both repels and allures at the same time, drawing you in, then challenging all your first impressions. She’s not relying on normative ideas of beauty as a crutch so much as reimagining what beauty might be. —Emily Watlington The difficulty of trying to remember all the little details in Laura Owens’s brain-bending painting/installation/show at Matthew Marks Gallery rhymes with the way that those details were hard to discern even when in their presence, in real time. The artist’s brush had bristled and stroked different dimensions, making for trompe l’oeil effects that twisted into spirals while turning inside-out and back again. Here too were traces of “painting” (as well as sly admonitions of it), as evident on the walls as they were on canvases that almost seemed to play a supporting role. Moving through the hidden door connecting the show’s two main spaces—each adorned with paintings of wallpaper and inexplicable things like pretzels floating in the air, and one with tiny mechanical panels that opened to reveal still more painting inside—gave rise to the most thrilling idea of an “art gallery” rather than the too-often humdrum reality of one. —Andy Battaglia This piece is a monumental act of witnessing: a 23-hour video drawn entirely from footage of U.S. State Department press briefings spanning October 2023 to January 2025, the end of the Biden administration. What begins with a journalist politely stating “I have a couple of questions” becomes an epic portrait of governmental irresponsibility as reporters—bleary, persistent, increasingly furious—try and fail to obtain clarity on Israel, Palestine, and the United States’s role therein. By editing out the spokesmen’s evasive, nothingburger replies, with cuts at times turning officials’ remarks into syllable salads, Reynolds and Ochshorn leave only the questions, revealing the briefings as a looping theater of deflection. It’s a horror film without the jump cuts: we watch the State Department rebrand its atrocities through the art of PR, confident in its own immunity. Presented without commentary, the footage indicts by showing instead of telling: this system will neither acknowledge its hypocrisies nor confront the human cost of its policies. As the genocide escalates and trust erodes, the journalists’ inquiries move from specific facts toward procedural and ethical pleas—“How do you know?” “Is there any plan?”—questions that echo far beyond the room. The film stands as one of the year’s most urgent artworks, a stark record of accountability sought and systematically denied. —Emily Watlington The beginning of the year saw Los Angeles hit by devastating wildfires, including the Eaton Fire, which decimated parts of Altadena, an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County that for generations has been home to a thriving hub of Black creativity. In response, Kenturah Davis created an embossed editioned print that featured a vintage map of Altadena onto which she had rubbed pigment that incorporated soil from outside her home, which burned in the fires. Altadena featured in an exhibition mounted by the California African American Museum just months after the wildfires to reflect on the immense loss and featured three generations of the Davis family. A work like Davis’s is a testament to the community’s resilience: from the ashes, a new Altadena will rise. —Maximilíano Durón How does one represent Palestine? It’s a question that has plagued artists and writers throughout the last century, as even the most seemingly anondyne depictions can’t help but become freighted with meaning and political valence—a tendency that has only grown since October 7 and Israel’s war in Gaza. In a work commissioned for the Taipei Biennial, Omar Mismar lands on a towering sculpture of flowers. The work is suffused with an unending grief, with the flowers evoking the ones placed typically at a tombstone. But Mismar is after something more complicated: the flowers are artificial, made out of fabric and modeled after illustrations found in Flowers of Palestine (1870), a book by Swiss missionary Hanna Zeller. Here, Mismar tackles a contradiction inherent in the idea of Palestine: some of the most detailed preservations of the land and culture were those created from a colonial gaze. The flowers do not wilt or smell. They are forever perfect, if inert. But read another way, Palestine remains an idea that will not wilt or die, due in no small part to the grief it inspires. —Harrison Jacobs More often than not—and often for the worse—US history is a work of fiction at the mercy of its makers. This provocation animates Stan Douglas’s five-channel film installation, Birth of a Nation (2025), which reframes one of cinema’s most insidious legacies of white supremacy: the 110-year-old Klan rallying cry that shares its name. For it, Douglas, a keen reader of the messages smuggled into our media, constructed an alternative narrative to a pivotal 13-minute section of D. W. Griffith’s original film, in which a Black soldier named Gus pursues a young white woman to the edge of a cliff. Though this is a tragic case of misidentification, the woman ultimately leaps to her death to escape his designs, a moment intended by the film to obliterate any sympathies that still stood for formerly enslaved Black Americans at the height of Jim Crow; the soldier—played by a white actor in blackface—is later lynched. While this scene loops on one screen, the other four present alternate outcomes of the same sequence of events made possible by new perspectives included in Douglas’s script. The characters are released from their crude casts of “villain,” “damsel,” and “hero,” and open the possibility that viewers, too, might question how they’ve looked away from a clearer, more complex picture of the powers shaping our prejudices. —Tessa Solomon Sometimes, an artwork gains new importance for reasons that are less than fortunate, and that was the case when Thomas J. Price’s Grounded in the Stars visited Times Square over the summer. The piece had already appeared elsewhere, generating little controversy in the process, but when Grounded in the Stars came to New York, the sculpture suddenly gained the attention of conservative reactionaries, who mocked Price’s piece online, remaking it in racist memes and as AI slop. What, exactly, was so offensive about a 12-foot-tall statue of a Black woman standing around? Most of the sculpture’s detractors seemed to deflect the question in social media tirades and op-eds, though it was clear that a larger debate about monuments—who deserves to be represented with them, and who they are for—hung in the background. With Trump now calling for the reinstatement of monuments that were “removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history” in 2020 or afterward, pieces like Grounded in the Stars suddenly seem even more essential. —Alex Greenberger More than a decade after Pussy Riot cofounder Nadya Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in Russia, the artist returned to a prison of her own making in her performance installation Police State (2025) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles this June. Tolokonnikova reimagined her prison cell as a space for art—a form of reclamation not only for herself but also for the Russian, Belarusian, and American prisoners whose pieces were incorporated into the installation. Inside, visitors could observe Tolokonnikova making music or art, or even resting throughout the day, via security camera footage and peepholes. The eerie authoritarian state came to life extended beyond MOCA, however, when anti-ICE protests erupted and the National Guard was deployed. With Police State unexpectedly closed to the public during the protests, Tolokonnikova continued staging the work in private, underscoring the piece’s continued relevance amid the ongoing political conflicts in the US and abroad. —Francesca Aton You can basically count on art by being censored for obscenity and support of matters like the Palestinian cause. But how can a simple flag cause trouble? That’s at the heart of the mystery behind Replacement by Cameron Rowland. Shown at the Palais de Tokyo as part of the show “Echo Delay Reverb,” the piece consisted simply of the flag of Martinique, an overseas department of France, flown above the Paris institution where a French flag is typically hung. Martinicans have fought for freedom from French rule for centuries, the artist pointed out in an accompanying text, and the flag replaced the customary French one. Within a day, the Palais de Tokyo removed the work, posting a text noting that the piece may be “considered illegal.” How? No one has elaborated. Score one for the power of the most minimal artistic gestures to cause a ruckus. —Brian Boucher In 2016, Jade Guanaro Kuriki-Olivo staged a performance called Liberté, in which performers of various gender identities dressed as the Statue of Liberty, turning a common New York tourist attraction into a kind of drag show. Nine years and two Trump administrations later, Kuriki-Olivo created a sequel in the form of Liberté Morte (Dead Liberty), a sculpture in which a Statue of Liberty costume is splayed out on a plinth. It was a a darker, more sinister approach that responded to the increased marginalization of trans people in the US between Trump administrations, and it suggested that freedom—a fragile notion right now—may be as good as dead in America. —Francesca Aton Trans Forming Liberty (2024), a painting depicting the Black trans-femme model and performance artist Arewà Basit carrying a torch à la the Statue of Liberty, made its debut last year at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in Amy Sherald’s survey “American Sublime.” It didn’t cause controversy there or at the Whitney Museum, where the exhibition went next. But before the show traveled to the Smithsonian-run National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the museum reportedly tried to remove the painting, leading Sherald to cancel the exhibition and allege censorship. Instead of shying away, Sherald told the New Yorker that the work “demands a fuller vision of freedom, one that includes the dignity of all bodies, all identities. Liberty isn’t fixed. She transforms, and so must we.” The painting thus became a symbol of protest—and even served as the cover for the August 11 issue of the New Yorker. —Francesca Aton The notion that history repeats itself is both a cliché and a truth, and it is one that Barbara Kruger has always considered in her work, which often finds her remaking the same textual statements about power using the same signature font, just in different settings. Featuring such phrases as “WHO IS BEYOND THE LAW?,” Untitled (Questions) ended up proving Kruger’s point when it figured so prominently in the background of the anti-ICE protests that roiled Los Angeles over the summer. Pictures of the National Guard standing beneath Kruger’s mural, sited at the Geffen Contemporary venue of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, seemed to answer the artist’s questions well enough, so it was hardly a shock when the photographs went viral. What was more surprising was just how closely those pictures mirrored ones taken in the same place in 1992, when the National Guard was deployed to LA to quell demonstrations following Rodney King’s beating by members of the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2018, Kruger said of Untitled (Questions), “It’s both tragic and disappointing that this work, 30 years later, might still have some resonance.” Seven years on, it remains both tragic and disappointing that Kruger is always right. —Alex Greenberger There’s something familiar yet uncanny about Kara Walker’s Unmanned Drone, which this year served as the focal point of The Brick’s portion of the “Monuments” exhibition. For this towering sculpture, Walker dissected and dismembered a decommissioned statue of Stonewall Jackson atop his horse, Little Sorrel, that once stood outside a courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. The original, unveiled in 1921 and made by Charles Keck, stood 13 feet high and 16 feet long. Walker’s version is just as monumental but deliberately fragmented, deconstructing the myth built around Jackson in the decades following the Civil War to prop up the falsehoods of the Lost Cause—namely, that had Jackson not met an untimely death, the Confederacy would have won. By taking apart the statue and soldering it back together so that Jackson’s and Sorrel’s body parts merge in confounding, often grotesque ways, Walker lays bare the mechanics of myth-making. She shows how the building blocks of racist historical narratives can appear too large to dismantle but, in fact, can be slowly unraveled to expose the lies beneath.—Maximilíano Durón The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

Black Friday 2025, while marred by unfortunate events like crazy RAM prices, brought us a ton of great tech deals. Gaming laptops, GPUs, smartphones, wireless earbuds, and virtually every other consumer tech category enjoyed some great discounts. This also includes home gaming consoles, where Sony dropped prices of all PlayStation 5 models for Black Friday. It appears that Sony’s strategy of reducing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles worked quite well, as the PS5 was reportedly the best-selling gaming console in the US during Black Friday 2025. According to data collected by Circana, the Sony PS5 accounted for 47% of the total gaming console volume moved during Black Friday 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2 was the second-best-selling console at 24%. What’s more interesting is that the third place was occupied by the Nex Playground. For the uninitiated, the Nex Playground is a motion-controlled, $249.99 gaming console meant for the entire family. The game library of Nex Playground is catered towards all age groups. So, the console primarily appeals to parents who want to buy a kid-safe console without spending a ton of cash. Another interesting, or worrying, observation here is that neither the Xbox Series X nor the cheaper Xbox Series S appears in the top three best-selling consoles on Black Friday. It is becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft doesn’t really care about the Xbox hardware, as the Xbox console business is in a pretty sad state. We’ve seen repeated price bumps, the closing down of studios like The Initiative, cancellation of in-development games, and mass layoffs. While the company has confirmed that there will be next-gen AMD-powered Xbox consoles, the current state of Xbox doesn’t inspire much confidence in the brand’s future.

The creative force behind Bethesda Game Studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, Todd Howard, delved into the questionable role of artificial intelligence in game development. The studio director framed it as an invaluable tool while also emphasizing the need for human creativity. Todd Howard discussed this at a promotional event for the second season of Amazon’s Fallout adaptation, which is scheduled to premiere later this month. Howard spoke to Eurogamer’s social producer Mat Jones about the show's expansion into new settings and references to New Vegas. During the conversation, the interview pivoted to AI. Todd Howard said: I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.” He clarified in the interview that Bethesda isn’t using AI as a means for content generation but to streamline internal workflows. Todd looked back and drew a parallel between Photoshop and AI. He said, “I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn’t want to go back to that version of Photoshop.” He believes that AI allows developers to improve efficiency in development processes without compromising on creativity. He further elaborated: But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. Howard’s comments about AI come at a turning point in the gaming industry, where many developers have sought to use AI to boost profitability, but this has led to widespread layoffs. To put things into perspective, a Google Cloud survey conducted in August 2025 found that 90% of game developers are already using AI in their workflows to automate repetitive tasks and cut costs. 95% of developers using AI stated that AI reduces the monotony of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of video games. A staggering 94% expect AI to reduce the overall cost of developing games in the long run. Howard concluded the interview, stating, “That’s our view on it. We want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.” Buy the Fallout: Season One Amazon Exclusive Steelbook bundle on Amazon Eurogamer

Google and Amazon are aggressively developing their own AI chips (TPUs, Trainium3) to reduce reliance on Nvidia, signaling a shift toward self-reliance in AI hardware. Despite a 2.5% stock dip due to Google's potential TPU deal with Meta, Nvidia maintains confidence in its generational lead, with Blackwell/Rubin chips sold out through 2026. Hyperscalers' ASICs offer cost efficiency for specific workloads, but Nvidia's GPUs and CUDA ecosystem remain unmatched for versatility across industries (AI, gaming, robotics, etc.). U.S.-China tech wars and export restrictions push China (via Huawei) to develop domestic alternatives, but Nvidia's short-term dominance persists as the AI chip market rapidly expands. While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition.

While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition. The AI revolution is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and nowhere is this more evident than in the semiconductor industry. Nvidia has long been the undisputed leader in AI hardware, powering everything from cloud computing to autonomous vehicles with its cutting-edge GPUs. But recent developments suggest that Big Tech giantsâparticularly Google and Amazonâare making aggressive moves to reduce their reliance on Nvidia by developing and even selling their own AI chips. The latest shockwave came with reports that Google could soon sell its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to Meta in a deal potentially worth billions. This sent Nvidia's stock tumbling 2.5% in a single day, signaling investor concerns that one of Nvidia's biggest customers might soon become a competitor. Meanwhile, Amazon unveiled its Trainium3 chip, boasting a 50% cost reduction in AI training compared to alternatives. While Nvidia remains confidentâclaiming its technology is still a generation aheadâthe question looms: Is the AI chip market shifting beneath Nvidia's feet? Google and Amazon aren't just buying Nvidia's GPUsâthey're designing their own specialized AI processors known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). Unlike Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are optimized for specific workloads, making them highly efficient for certain AI tasks. "Google knows their requirements and can optimize their chips accordingly," says Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. "That doesn't mean their TPUs are superior to Nvidia in every way, but for Google's needs, they can outperform." Amazon's Trainium3 follows a similar logicâtailored for AI training workloads, it promises significant cost savings. But ASICs come with limitations. If a company's AI models evolve, their custom chips may need redesigningâa costly and time-consuming process. That's why hyperscalers like Google and Amazon still buy Nvidia GPUs as a hedge against shifting AI demands. Nvidia's unmatched flexibility Nvidia's strength lies in its versatility. Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram." Additionally, Nvidia isn't just selling GPUsâit's expanding into networking with NVLink and AI infrastructure solutions. Amazon, despite pushing Trainium3, still relies on Nvidia's NVLink for its servers. This symbiotic relationship means that even as Big Tech builds its own chips, Nvidia remains indispensable. Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions. As Washington restricts AI chip exports to Beijing, China is scrambling to develop domestic alternatives. Huawei's Ascend chips pose a long-term threat, but for now, China remains dependent on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Big Tech's push for self-reliance reflects a broader trend: AI is too critical to outsource entirely. Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players.

Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players. Watch this videoÂ aboutÂ Nvidia's stock price doubling in the next couple of years. This video is from theÂ TrendingNewsÂ channel onÂ Brighteon.com.

"That doesn't mean their TPUs are superior to Nvidia in every way, but for Google's needs, they can outperform." Amazon's Trainium3 follows a similar logicâtailored for AI training workloads, it promises significant cost savings. But ASICs come with limitations. If a company's AI models evolve, their custom chips may need redesigningâa costly and time-consuming process. That's why hyperscalers like Google and Amazon still buy Nvidia GPUs as a hedge against shifting AI demands. Nvidia's unmatched flexibility Nvidia's strength lies in its versatility. Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram." Additionally, Nvidia isn't just selling GPUsâit's expanding into networking with NVLink and AI infrastructure solutions. Amazon, despite pushing Trainium3, still relies on Nvidia's NVLink for its servers. This symbiotic relationship means that even as Big Tech builds its own chips, Nvidia remains indispensable. Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Overheard at DPMS — How agencies grapple with AI in programmatic

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 12. This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It can sometimes be a fine line between a promise and a threat — but that’s where generative AI stands in its application to the media agency world today. At least that’s the biggest takeaway from a Town Hall discussion at last week’s Programmatic Marketing Summit, held in New Orleans as the last of Digiday’s events for the year 2025. Held under Chatham House rules, which provide anonymity and the freedom to speak freely for the media agency people attending, the Town Hall conversation highlighted the confusion and complexity surrounding the intersection of programmatic advertising and agentic AI. There were differing opinions over to what extent AI and agentic technologies are already part of programmatic workflows (and there seemed to be no consensus definition for what qualifies as agentic). What the agency executives did seem to agree on, though, was that AI agents are best kept away from the actual point of transaction between media buyers and sellers. Instead they should be relegated to pre- and post-transaction tasks, like helping to plan campaign parameters and to organize post-campaign performance data. But even that level of AI involvement will require enhanced training of agency employees not just on AI tools (and their limitations) but also on the fundamentals of programmatic advertising workflows for the human employees to better supervise their AI counterparts. The following has been edited for space and clarity. Setting the stage “I think we all know that machine learning AI … from a buying standpoint is already very integrated. But I think what is new is the gen AI, right? And that’s what’s exciting. The agent idea, and this idea of ideation creating autonomy is where it’s evolving. But I don’t think we all know what we’re talking about, just because it is already integrated within buying across Meta, Google, etc. But from a gen AI aspect, I think that’s what’s really exciting. Where we’ve seen efficiencies in terms of our AI that we’re using is helping with media mix models planning. That really helps with efficiencies, as well as automation in general, in terms of administrative tasks, analytics, and aggregating data.” AI used as a smoke screen “Every agency has some level of machine learning being used in their algorithms and optimizations. We’re not afraid of that, but it isn’t very transparent by nature. One of the challenges we face in this industry is now we’re being fed AI as a cover for more opaqueness in pricing, more opaqueness in performance optimizations. Whether it’s [The Trade Desk’s] Kokai’s new algorithms all trying to do stuff for you and saying ‘Just trust us.’ That, I think scares us, because we know it’s not LLMs, but we also know they’re using it as a smoke screen, and we’re not all equipped to poke holes in their theories and push back. I think that might be where a lot of the fear is, because we just see more opaqueness and us having less and less control.” “We have not gotten there yet, but one of the things that we’re working on on our agency is, how do we use the agentic AI to help us explain what AI is doing in our campaigns? But how do we get it to explain stuff? Because if a person makes an optimization, you can say, Why did you make that optimization? What do you think it was going to do? And what did it do? AI doesn’t do that — it just makes the optimization and has a result or doesn’t have a result.” Careful with that agent, Eugene “Agents are built for fetching and gathering. That’s what they do good. They don’t think. You just asked why — they don’t do that. They’re all probabilistic anyway. Technically agents are [Las] Vegas on all the things you’re looking to track, and it tries to get to a better result based on what it’s seen in the past. So if you’re doing something new right now with the agent, don’t do that. They’re not really good at that yet, because they’re working on odds. I feel like we’re probably three or four years away from trusting any of these things.” “AI can be really good for things with defined parameters. But as an industry, we’re kind of lumping in a lot of AI together. For, say, a programmatic media plan, it’s going to potentially hallucinate because things like outdated information aren’t being taken down from the web, and it’s taking that into consideration. If you just let it to its own devices, you’re not going to get best results. But if you use a very clean data set to find parameters of how things should be evaluated, I think it can be very beneficial.” What’s to come? “From the strategist side, some of the programmatic partners actually have tools that will build your whole media plan, right? But what I haven’t seen is the integration being there. I think their dream of it is, click the one button that builds the plan for you and optimizes the plan. I don’t think that’s upon us yet, but I think that’s what may be coming for us.” “All of us are being told that’s what people want — let’s do that. But then you have legal compliance, and your finance team. All it takes is for the AI to hallucinate one zero, and you’re in big trouble. And that’s one mistake that’s going to cost you potentially a client, or could cost you your job. Because LLMs will never NOT hallucinate — their underlying architecture design has that flaw. I don’t know how many trillions of dollars have been invested in this, but they haven’t fixed this problem. They’re like a very smart intern — we’re going to give it information. It’s going to be able to do a lot of tasks that are menial and take a lot of time, and do it fast. But before we do action, we’re going to put it through some of the older models, or sometimes trust the older models to do the actual heavy lifting, because they have experience. We know they work, and we know they can work and they can do it better.” “You were saying smart intern — it’s a six year old. Think of it as your six year old child who will give you an answer whether it’s right or not, because they want to prove to you that they think what you said is important. That’s AI right now. It’ll be different later, but right now, it’s a six year old.” “We’re using AI in pre- and in post-production. Your whole planning team is pre-production. Your analytics team is post production, giving reports back. That is a lot of the day to day job, so that can save us a ton of time. The actual production part is actually a small percentage of our time. We set up the campaign, we run it, the optimizations come from post analytics, and then we go and make the changes. A lot of the lead up is a lot of time that AI can save us.” Accountability “Accountability comes with management not allowing people to use, ‘Well, that’s what the AI gave me’ as an excuse. They have to be accountable to their work no matter how it’s been generated. And I think that’s how we have to move forward. Because if we allow everyone to use that as an excuse, that we’re going tons of errors.” “My concern is on [the 25-year-old media planner’s] over-reliance on AI for doing a lot of these things. Is that going to impact overall foundational knowledge that allows them to make these strategic decisions creatively and out of the box? Because they’ve been brought up [thinking] ‘Well, I can just do all of these things by throwing it in here.’ They don’t understand the why behind it, and then it snowballs 20 years from now.” How to train your AI “How would you train the AI better? The best way I can describe it is, it’s like good barbecue — low and slow. Use older data that’s very specific. It probably comes in slower than what you’re getting from signal-based data, or real-time data and all the rest of that. Not necessarily because it’s better, but because it has less garbage in it.” Does the need to market as aggressively as possible during the holidays offer an opportunity for retail media networks and challenger social platforms to capture more holiday and 2026 ad dollars? The answer is yes — if they can close the measurement and trust gap, according to new research from Kantar. Some supporting stats: “This merger is a reminder that scale doesn’t fix fragmentation. AI only works when the underlying customer data is unified, governed, and understood. The organizations that win in the next phase of marketing won’t be the ones with the most tools — they’ll be the ones with the clearest picture of their customers.” Agency and ad tech executives explain what tasks in their programmatic advertising workflows they would — and wouldn’t — outsource to AI agents. Blu is essentially a content marketing platform that uses a variety of LLMs to help the independent agency’s clients craft broader business goals through the prism of media Analysts and media buyers expect ‘upward pressure’ on CPMs, should Netflix win the tussle with Paramount.

Title: Not share price, not performance, here's what Apple's management exodus hints for the tech giant's future

Apple is witnessing an unusually concentrated wave of senior exits just as it tries to reposition itself for an AI-driven future. A series of exits and impending departures across top management and engineering ranks in recent weeks has raised fresh questions about the stability of the company’s leadership bench — and the readiness of the world’s most valuable firm to accelerate its artificial-intelligence (AI) push. A Yahoo Finance report said that while a quick succession of exits usually signifies a sinking boat, there could be more to this situation. The churn comes at a moment of financial strength: Apple has posted strong quarterly results powered by new iPhone sales, its market value has climbed past $4 trillion, and the stock is trading near record highs. The issue, the report said, isn’t performance—it’s who is leaving, and from which parts of the organization. According to the report, Apple has been under mounting pressure to deliver on AI, a space where critics argue it has fallen behind despite the technology’s transformative potential. Many of the executives now exiting were tied to AI product integration, hardware strategy or design — the very areas Apple needs to lean on as it tries to close the gap. Besides this, CEO Tim Cook is nearing retirement age, and there is big speculation over who will, or can, take over after front-runner Jeff Williams left. Notably, Apple has not explicitly said that the executive changes are AI development-based, but most of those on their way out have been closely associated with its AI product integration or design aspects. Deepwater Asset Management managing partner and longtime Apple watcher Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance, “I think that the changes that have happened are largely because Cook wants to shake things up. And instead of being a follower in AI, he wants to be a leader. So, I think it's more than just a typical transition. I think ... this is a big deal.” A veteran engineer who joined in 2018, with prior experience at Microsoft and Google, Giannandrea's departure was viewed as a strategic move, as Apple continued to lag behind competitors in the AI space, as per various reports. Now filling the role is researcher Amar Subramanya, who moved from corporate Vice President of AI at Microsoft, before which he spent 16 years heading engineering for Google's Gemini digital assistant. He will report to Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi. Announcing his appointment, Apple cited Subramanya's experience integrating AI into features and products as “important to Apple's ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features”, AFP reported. Commenting on Subramanya's appointment in the company release, Apple CEO Tim Cook said AI is “central to Apple's strategy” and that the new chief will bring “extraordinary AI expertise” to the role. Alan Dye, meanwhile, was involved in the Apple Vision Pro launch and helped with “integrating eye/hand interactions and immersion”. In 2025, he led the design of Liquid Glass and helped unify the design language for iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, watchOS and tvOS. ZK Research founder and principal analyst Zeus Kerravala told Yahoo Finance, “There is a renewed push by Apple to accelerate its AI roadmap, especially after criticism that its earlier AI efforts with Siri ... lagged behind a lot of the rivals. I think what makes Apple kind of unique is they can be behind [in] technology because of the fandom that's around Apple and the ecosystem that they lock people into. I think, from an Apple perspective right now, it's ‘make these changes now, and make sure you are positioned well,’ or you are going to start losing share, eventually.” (With inputs from Agencies) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: OpenAI goes from stock market savior to burden as AI risks mount
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/07/openai-stock-market-risk-sam-altman-alphabet-google-gemini/

Wall Street’s sentiment toward companies associated with artificial intelligence is shifting, and it’s all about two companies: OpenAI is down, and Alphabet Inc. is up. The maker of ChatGPT is no longer seen as being on the cutting edge of AI technology and is facing questions about its lack of profitability and the need to grow rapidly to pay for its massive spending commitments. Meanwhile, Google’s parent is emerging as a deep-pocketed competitor with tentacles in every part of the AI trade. “OpenAI was the golden child earlier this year, and Alphabet was looked at in a very different light,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. “Now sentiment is much more tempered toward OpenAI.” As a result, the shares of companies in OpenAI’s orbit — principally Oracle Corp., CoreWeave Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., but also Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and SoftBank, which has an 11% stake in the company — are coming under heavy selling pressure. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s momentum is boosting not only its stock price, but also those it’s associated with like Broadcom Inc., Lumentum Holdings Inc., Celestica Inc., and TTM Technologies Inc. Read More: Alphabet’s AI Strength Fuels Biggest Quarterly Jump Since 2005 The shift has been dramatic in magnitude and speed. Just a few weeks ago, OpenAI was sparking huge rallies in any company related to it. Now, those connections look more like an anchor. It’s a change that carries wide-ranging implications, given how central the closely held company has been to the AI mania that has driven the stock market’s three-year rally. “A light has been shined on the complexity of the financing, the circular deals, the debt issues,” Ewing said. “I’m sure this exists around the Alphabet ecosystem to a certain degree, but it was exposed as pretty extreme for OpenAI’s deals, and appreciating that was a game-changer for sentiment.” A basket of companies connected to OpenAI has gained 74% in 2025, which is impressive but far shy of the 146% jump by Alphabet-exposed stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index is up 22%. The skepticism surrounding OpenAI can be dated to August, when it unveiled GPT-5 to mixed reactions. It ramped up last month when Alphabet released the latest version of its Gemini AI model and got rave reviews. As a result, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman declared a “code red” effort to improve the quality of ChatGPT, delaying other projects until it gets its signature product in line. Alphabet’s perceived strength goes beyond Gemini. The company has the third highest market capitalization in the S&P 500 and a ton of cash at its disposal. It also has a host of adjacent businesses, like Google Cloud and a semiconductor manufacturing operation that’s gaining traction. And that’s before you consider the company’s AI data, talent and distribution, or its successful subsidiaries like YouTube and Waymo. “There’s a growing sense that Alphabet has all the pieces to emerge as the dominant AI model builder,” said Brian Colello, technology equity senior strategist at Morningstar. “Just a couple months ago, investors would’ve given that title to OpenAI. Now there’s more uncertainty, more competition, more risk that OpenAI isn’t the slam-dunk winner.” Read More: Alphabet’s AI Chips Are a Potential $900 Billion ‘Secret Sauce’ Representatives for OpenAI and Alphabet didn’t respond to requests for comment. The difference between being first or second place goes beyond bragging rights, it also has significant financial ramifications for the companies and their partners. For example, if users gravitating to Gemini slows ChatGPT’s growth, it will be harder for OpenAI to pay for cloud-computing capacity from Oracle or chips from AMD. By contrast, Alphabet’s partners in building out its AI effort are thriving. Shares of Lumentum, which makes optical components for Alphabet’s data centers, have more than tripled this year, putting them among the 30 best performers in the Russell 3000 Index. Celestica provides the hardware for Alphabet’s AI buildout, and its stock is up 252% in 2025. Meanwhile Broadcom — which is building the tensor processing unit, or TPU, chips Alphabet uses — has seen its stock price leap 68% since the end of last year. OpenAI has announced a number of ambitious deals in recent months. The flurry of activity “rightfully brought scrutiny and concern over whether OpenAI can fund all this, whether it is biting off more than it can chew,” Colello said. “The timing of its revenue growth is uncertain, and every improvement a competitor makes adds to the risk that it can’t reach its aspirations.” In fairness, investors greeted many of these deals with excitement, because they appeared to mint the next generation of AI winners. But with the shift in sentiment, they’re suddenly taking a wait-and-see attitude. “When people thought it could generate revenue and become profitable, those big deal numbers seemed possible,” said Brian Kersmanc, portfolio manager at GQG Partners, which has about $160 billion in assets. “Now we’re at a point where people have stopped believing and started questioning.” Kersmanc sees the AI euphoria as the “dot-com era on steroids,” and said his firm has gone from being heavily overweight tech to highly skeptical. “We’re trying to avoid areas of over-hype and a lot of those were fueled by OpenAI,” he said. “Since a lot of places have been touched by this, it will be a painful unwind. It isn’t just a few tech names that need to come down, though they’re a huge part of the index. All these bets have parallel trades, like utilities, with high correlations. That’s the fear we have, not just that OpenAI spun up this narrative, but that so many things were lifted on the hype.” OpenAI’s public-relations flaps haven’t helped. The startup’s Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar recently suggested the US government “backstop the guarantee that allows the financing to happen,” which raised some eyebrows. But she and Altman later clarified that the company hasn’t requested such guarantees. Then there was Altman’s appearance on the “Bg2 Pod,” where he was asked how the company can make spending commitments that far exceed its revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer — I just, enough,” was the CEO’s response. Read More: Sam Altman’s Business Buddies Are Getting Stung Altman’s dismissal was problematic because the gap between OpenAI’s revenue and its spending plans between now and 2033 is about $207 billion, according to HSBC estimates. “Closing the gap would need one or a combination of factors, including higher revenue than in our central case forecasts, better cost management, incremental capital injections, or debt issuance,” analyst Nicolas Cote-Colisson wrote in a research note on Nov. 24. Considering that OpenAI is expected to generate revenue of more than $12 billion in 2025, its compute cost “compounds investor nervousness about associated returns,” not only for the company itself, but also “for the interlaced AI chain,” he wrote. To be sure, companies like Oracle and AMD aren’t solely reliant on OpenAI. They operate in areas that continue to see a lot of demand, and their products could find customers even without OpenAI. Furthermore, the weakness in the stocks could represent a buying opportunity, as companies tied to ChatGPT and the chips that power it are trading at a discount to those exposed to Gemini and its chips for the first time since 2016, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis. “I see a lot of untapped demand and penetration across industries, and that will ultimately underpin growth,” said Kieran Osborne, chief investment officer at Mission Wealth, which has about $13 billion in assets under management. “Monetization is the end goal for these companies, and so long as they work toward that, that will underpin the investment case.”

Title: What bubble? Asset managers in risk-on mode stick with stocks

Time Published: 2025-12-07T23:55:22Z

There’s a time when investments run their course and the prudent move is to cash out. For global asset managers who’ve ridden double-digit gains in equities for three straight years, that time is not now. “Our expectation of solid growth and easier monetary and fiscal policies supports a risk-on tilt in our multi-asset portfolios. We remain overweight stocks and credit,” said Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are playing the powerful trends in place and are bullish through the end of next year,” said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS. “For now we are not contrarians.” “Start the year with sufficient exposure, even over-exposure to equities, predominantly in emerging market equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, EMEA chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We don’t expect a recession in 2026 to unfold.” Those assessments came from Bloomberg News interviews with 39 investment managers across the US, Asia and Europe, including at BlackRock Inc., Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Franklin Templeton. More than three-quarters of the allocators were positioning portfolios for a risk-on environment through 2026. The thrust of the bet is that resilient global growth, further developments in artificial intelligence, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will deliver outsize returns in all fashion of global equity markets. The call is not without risks, including simply its pervasiveness among the respondents, along with their overall high degree of assuredness. The view among the institutional investors also aligns with that of sell-side strategists around the globe. Should the bullishness play out as expected, it would deliver a stunning fourth straight year of bumper returns for the MSCI All-Country World Index. That would extend a run that’s added $42 trillion in market capitalization since the end of 2022 — the most value created for equity investors in history. That’s not to say the optimism is without merit. The artificial intelligence trade has added trillions in market value to dozens of firms plying the industry, but just three years after ChatGPT broke into the public consciousness, AI remains in the early phase of development. The buy-side managers largely rejected the idea that the technology has blown a bubble in equity markets. While many acknowledged some pockets of froth in unprofitable tech names, 85% of managers said valuations among the Magnificent Seven and other AI heavyweights are not overly inflated. Fundamentals back the trade, they said, which marks the beginning of a new industrial cycle. “You can’t call it a bubble when you’re seeing tech companies deliver a massive earnings beat. In fact, earnings from the sector have outstripped all other US stocks,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management. As such, investors expect the US to remain the engine of the rally. “American exceptionalism is far from dead,” said Jose Rasco, chief investment officer at HSBC Americas. “As artificial intelligence continues to spread around the globe, the US will be a key participant.” Most investors echoed the sentiment expressed by Helen Jewell, international chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BlackRock, who suggested also searching outside the US for meaningful upside. “The US is where the high-return high-growth companies are, so we have to be realistic about that. But those are already reflected in valuations, and there are probably more interesting opportunities outside the US,” she said. Profits matter above all else for equity investors, and huge bumps in government spending from Europe to Asia have stoked estimates for strong gains in earnings. “We have begun to see a meaningful broadening of earnings momentum, both across market capitalizations and across regions, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea,” said Wellington Management equity strategist Andrew Heiskell. “Looking into 2026, we see clear potential for a revival of earnings growth in Europe and a wider range of emerging markets.” India is one of the most compelling opportunities for 2026, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions. “We see real potential for India to become the Korea-like re-rating story of 2026, a market that transitions from tactical allocation to strategic core exposure in global portfolios,” she said. Nelson Yu, head of equities at AllianceBernstein, said he sees improvements outside of the US that will mandate allocations. He noted governance reform in Japan, capital discipline in Europe and recovering profitability in some emerging markets. At the sector level, the investors are looking for AI proxies, notably among clean energy providers that can help meet the technology’s ravenous demand for power. Smaller stocks are also finding favor. “The earnings outlook has brightened for small-capitalization stocks, industrials and financials,” said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Institute. “Small-cap stocks and industrials, which are typically more highly leveraged than the rest of the market, will see profitability rise as the Federal Reserve trims interest rates and debt servicing costs fall.” Over at Santander Asset Management, Francisco Simón sees earnings growth of more than 20% for US small caps after years of underperformance. Reflecting the optimism, the Russell 2000 Index of such equities recently hit a record high. Meanwhile, the combination of low valuations and strong fundamentals makes health care one of the most compelling contrarian opportunities in a bullish cycle, a preponderance of managers said. “Health-care related sectors can surprise to the upside in the US markets,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of cross-asset solutions at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “This is a mid-term election year and policy may at the margin support many companies. Valuations are still attractive and have a lot of catch up to do.” Virtually every allocator struck at least a note of caution about what lies ahead. The top worry among them was a rekindling of inflation in the US. If the Fed is forced by rising prices to abruptly pause or even end its easing cycle, the potential for turbulence is high. “A scenario — which is not our base case — whereby US inflation rebounds in 2026 would constitute a double whammy for multi-asset funds as it would penalize both stocks and bonds. In this sense it would be much worse than an economic slowdown,” said Amélie Derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “The way investors are headed for 2026, they need to have the Fed on their side,” she added. Another worry is around President Donald Trump’s capriciousness, particularly when it comes to trade. Any flareup in his trade spats that fuels inflation through heightened tariffs would weigh on risk assets. Oil and gas producers remain unloved by the group, though that could change if a major geopolitical event upends supply lines. While such an outcome would bolster those sectors, the overall impact would likely be negative for risk assets, they said. “Any geopolitical situation that can affect the price of oil is what will have the largest impact on the financial markets. Clearly both the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia situations can impact oil prices,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Multiple respondents flagged European autos as a “no-go” area for 2026, citing intense competitive pressure from Chinese carmakers, margin compression and structural challenges in the transition to electric vehicles. “Personally I don’t believe for a minute that there will be a rebound in the sector,” said Isabelle de Gavoty at Allianz GI. Outside of those worries, most asset managers simply believe that there’s little reason to fret about the upward momentum being interrupted — outside, of course, from the contrarian signal such near-uniform bullishness sends. “Everyone seems to be risk-on at the moment, and that worries me a bit in the sense that the concentration of positions creates less tolerance for adverse surprises,” said Amundi’s Derambure.

MFO’s founding mission is to “write for the benefit of intellectually curious, serious investors— managers, advisers, and individuals—who need to go beyond marketing fluff, beyond computer-generated recommendations and beyond Morningstar’s coverage universe.” But one of our core precepts is “80% of all existing funds could disappear today with no loss to anyone, except possibly the managers who have to explain it to their spouses.” The goodriddance group includes two overlapping sorts of idiocy: (1) many are launched at the behest of an advisor’s marketing department or strategic team. Short version: “hey, we need at least one bond fund if we’re going to keep their money in-house. Why don’t you go make one for us?” Or “everything who’s anybody has a target-date retirement series. Why don’t we have a target-date retirement series, hmmmmm???” And (2) many are cynical ploys to play on human weakness. Short version: “look, the guys in my fantasy football league know Tesla better than Musk does, and they want a way to do a quick-pivot from doubling down on Tesla’s morning performance to double-shorting it in the afternoon, so let’s do this crazy thing!” Through November 1,087 new funds and ETFs were launched in 2025. Of those, over 300 were niche trading toys: ether, hedged bitcoin, crypto index, altcoin, onchain, Litecoin, bitcoin covered call, long bitcoin / short ether, hedera coin, double-short Palantir, leveraged long + income Palantir, selling put options on ETFs that are double-long Robinhood Markets stock … The mix included six new ways to play Tesla, up or down, and one that combines Tesla and Uber, which gives us a total of 13 Tesla-specific ETFs. Bad news: these are designed to suck the life out of you, while convincing you that you’re better at this than Warren Buffett ever was. Look at column #3, dear friends: losses of 50-75% before they reach their first birthday. They are invitations to play a trading game where your reaction time is measured in minutes and your opponents’ are measured in milliseconds. Good news: these are going to perish in droves because they’re a bad idea and they can’t convince enough people long enough that they aren’t. That was the fate of the flood of internet funds (remember Nothing But Net?), blockchain funds, the flood of “green funds,” the flood of alts-for-the-masses funds, the flood of emerging market consumers funds … And yet, each year also brings several dozen legitimately interesting opportunities: often experienced managers or teams exploring new asset classes or extending proven disciplines in interesting new ways. We want to suggest that you add 10 notable rookies to your year-end research list. What makes these funds rookies? Our sibling site, MFO Premium, has an amazing fund screener which does calculations inconceivable on any site charging less than $12,000 a year (looks toward Chicago). One function of the site allows you to screen funds by age (from “launched this year” to “rookies” to “over 90 years old”). The rookie screener selects for funds with between one and two years of operation: long enough to take a few hits, short enough to remain fresh and interesting. What makes these funds notable? We screened each of six broad baskets of rookie funds – US equity, global equity, international equity, mixed asset, alternatives, and bonds – for funds that met two performance criteria. First, they had to have downside deviation ratings that were average-to-excellent. “Deviation” is a fund’s bounciness. Standard deviation measures the bounces both up and down. Downside deviation recognizes that you don’t object to having your fund bounce higher; you’re only steamed when it bounces down. So downside deviation measures a fund’s return below the risk-free rate of return; that is, if you make less in a period than the 90-day T-bill, you’re generating downside, and we’re measuring it. Second, they had to have Ulcer Indexes that were average-to-excellent. The Ulcer Index captures two metrics: how far a fund falls and how long it stays down. The logic is simple: if your manager (or index) falls flat on their face and struggles to get up, you’re going to get an ulcer. Big fall, long time down = major ulcer, high Ulcer Index. Little stumble, up and dusted off = barely any ulcer at all. That gave us a list of funds that, so far, have resisted the impulse to implode. We then sorted by Sharpe ratio – the most common measure of risk-adjusted returns – and began with the fund atop the list. If that fund shows two further criteria – it’s available to the general public, and it does not evidently rely on financial engineering, blackbox strategies, or disciplines so complex that I couldn’t explain them to myself – then we shared them with you. After that, I scanned the top 10 list in each category, asking the question, “What looks interesting here?” Our answers follow. What can I say? The ETF tracks an index of large cap companies that (a) put a lot of money into research and development and (b) have increased that commitment in each of the past three years. It ranks them, invests in the top 50, and rebalances once a year. The target is finding companies that are reinvesting in their own growth. Here are the particulars from First Trust: The fund’s Investors Guide is pretty thin. The short summary: the world is changing fast, R&D is essential to keeping up, and we find the most R&D intensive large caps for you. Plausible, though not a lot of depth there. The premise that companies investing heavily in R&D will matter more than those coasting on yesterday’s patents isn’t new. What’s new is that ‘R&D’ in 2025 increasingly means AI compute clusters and model training, not better mousetraps. First Trust isn’t picking winners; they’re just betting that the companies willing to light billions on fire today are more likely to own tomorrow than those protecting margin today. Those interested in a more active approach to the same discipline might consider Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund (IWIRX), a five-star actively managed fund that found life in the late 1990s as the Wireless (magazine) Index of innovative companies. Matthew and Ian do exceptional work. The $111 billion American Funds American Mutual Fund (AMRMX) annoys me. First, you’ve got this dumb reduplicative name. Second, they push it out in 19 distinct share classes. Third, it’s a whale: $111 billion, with low Active Share (58) and a 0.58% expense ratio on the “A” shares. That having been said, it’s also got $111 billion for a reason: it’s really good at delivering what it promises and has been so for a really long time. American Mutual does not specialize in raw outperformance – over the past 60 years, it has outperformed its peers by an average of just 0.3% per year – it specializes in getting you there with less trauma. MFO Premium tracks dozens of risk metrics, and AMRMX outperforms its peers on virtually every metric for virtually every trailing period. CGCV is the ETF version of that fund. While it is only 1% of the size of American Mutual, the ETF charges substantially less than the retail “A” shares of the fund for the same strategy and same management team. What you’re getting: Conservative Equity tries to balance current income, growth of capital, and principal protection. It typically holds about 90 stocks, primarily in well-established, dividend-paying US and Canadian companies with strong balance sheets. We checked 756 rolling three-year periods for American Mutual, dating back to 1960. The typical experience of an investor holding on for three years is a return of 11.0%. Its worst-ever three-year run was -11.0% and its worst-ever five-year span was -4.1% APR. The fund many people wished they were in is T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation, but you can’t have it. The fund has been kicking butt, under three different managers, since the 1980s: for every trailing period from one to 40 years, it has higher total return, higher Sharpe, smaller maximum drawdown, and lower Ulcer Index than its peers. And it’s closed. The fact that the success spans manager tenures suggests it’s the process that works, and TRP has been rolling out a suite of funds that incorporate variations of the discipline. This version is a mixed‑asset conservative fund that seeks total return by pairing income‑oriented fixed income with a risk‑aware equity sleeve, typically keeping roughly half to two‑thirds of assets in bonds and other debt instruments and the balance in stocks. With a 12.5% APR that is about 1.9 percentage points ahead of its peer group and a Sharpe ratio of 1.52, it has delivered competitive results with a profile designed to feel more like a cautious “paycheck plus growth” vehicle than an aggressive balanced fund. What really sets PRCFX apart is that it extends the discipline, team, and “capital appreciation with downside defense” DNA of the long‑closed Capital Appreciation Fund into a more income‑tilted format, giving investors access to a seasoned, franchise‑level process that was previously hard to reach. SEI is a manager-of-managers (MOM?) advisor. We all know that within any asset class (US equities), there are many sensible investment approaches, but no one strategy (large-cap momentum) works all the time. One alternative is that you could own three or four complementary funds and then shift their weight in your portfolio as market conditions change. Or you could surrender that particular fantasy and adopt a new one: you’ll hire someone who will hire managers representing three or four complementary strategies and will rebalance them for you within the fund. That “someone” is SEI. For SEEM, SEI hired three fundamental EM managers—one focused on quality, one on momentum with a small-cap tilt, one on value with macro overlay—and then uses their own quant tools to decide how much each should control. The goal is a broadly diversified, all‑cap portfolio across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and other developing regions. The fund has had an unusually strong first year, with both higher returns (29% APR vs 24% for its peers) and lower volatility (measured by maximum drawdown, standard deviation, and downside deviation) than its peers, leading to substantially higher risk-adjusted returns metrics (Sharpe ratio and Ulcer Index are strikingly higher). The fund has drawn $320 million in assets and charges 0.60% after waivers, a noticeable bargain price. One caveat is that the MOM approach does not tend to generate star performance. Morningstar tries it with their nine house-branded funds, seven of which are three stars or below. Litman Gregory (which now bears the ugly name iMPG) made it the heart of their business model in the Masters funds, only two of which survive. SEI has done exceptionally well with the model, but the caveat remains. The other is that not a single one of the thirty-eleven managers, including SEI employees, has invested a penny of their own money in the fund. GMO International Value ETF (GMOI) is the retail incarnation of GMO International Opportunistic Value (GTMIX), an institutional fund that’s been around since 1998. The strategy there (and here), is to concentrate on what GMO calls “deep value” stocks in developed markets outside the U.S., seeking total return from a heavily contrarian, valuation‑driven discipline. Its record since inception is exceptional, though perhaps a tiny bit irrelevant. It has outperformed its peers over every trailing measurement period (3-, 5-, 10-, 20-, inception), generally by 100 – 250 bps. Its risk metrics (maximum drawdown, standard deviation, downside deviation) are generally in line with or better than its peers, and its risk-adjusted returns metrics (Sharpe ratio and Ulcer index) are consistently better. The three current managers arrived in May 2023, meaning this 27-year track record is largely someone else’s work, even if the new team has decades of GMO experience elsewhere and responsibility for implementing the strategy that others have piloted. (And two of the three have declined to invest in the ETF.) The ETF has done well since launch. Its 31.7% APR beats its peers by 620 bps, and its risk metrics have been pretty much in line with its peers. The fund has gathered $215 million in assets in just over a year. This rookie vehicle is part of the rising wave of ETF launches, which give the rest of us access to an institutional‑grade GMO discipline that has historically lived in separate accounts and mutual funds.​ Rockefeller Capital Management launched a Global Equity Strategy in 1991. Marketed primarily for institutional clients, intermediaries, high-net-worth individuals, and family offices, the strategy has accumulated $4.5 billion. There’s no public performance record that we can find. The Rockco.com website is among the world’s most annoying, offering a rich and slow-loading visual experience with virtually no content concerning its investment capabilities beyond the moral equivalent of “we cool. We cool!” Here’s what we do know. The firm talks a lot about the overemphasis on short-term metrics among most investors (it has its roots in 1882 so the bias is explicable), about its global scope and unconventional sources of insight (mostly unexplained). The firm has three equity and three muni bond ETFs. The two older equity ETFs (Climate Solutions and US Small Cap Core) are … okay. Climate Solutions is in a meaningless peer group (Specialty / Miscellaneous), and Small Cap mostly tracks its peers. In October 2024, the firm launched Rockefeller Global Equity ETF (RGEF) with approximately $700 million in assets. This actively managed ETF invests primarily in large‑cap stocks across developed and emerging markets, using a bottom‑up fundamental process to build a 45–75 stock portfolio of companies with durable competitive advantages and a long‑term earnings runway. It has done quite well, on both upside and downside measures, in its short life. It has an APR of 23.2% versus its peers’ 18.9%, with dramatically lower volatility and a dramatically higher Sharpe ratio. Whether the advisor’s opacity reflects confidence born of 33 years managing money for people who know them personally, or simply indifference, is unclear. What is clear: investors considering RGEF are being asked to trust the Rockefeller name more than any articulated investment philosophy. This is the ETF version of Fidelity Hedged Equity Fund (FEQHX), a $550 million, four-star fund whose two managers are responsible for about $1 billion in hedged equity products at Fido. At base, the managers construct an equity portfolio that looks like the S&P 500 and then buy puts on their holdings to buffer the effects of market declines. The puts can rise in value when markets fall, so they make a positive contribution at much less than the cost of shorting stocks as a hedge. We long ago stopped reading Fidelity’s annual reports and manager “interviews” because they are so templated and sanitized that you learn virtually nothing from them, and that’s the case here, too. A chatbot comes across as much human and thoughtful. That said, the fund’s performance numbers are solid. Relative to an unhedged peer group, the fund posted solid absolute returns with 15-20% less volatility. FHEQ is an actively managed global large‑cap core strategy that owns a diversified equity portfolio while using put options and related techniques to buffer downside, targeting a smoother ride through equity cycles. Its 19% APR, about 0.2 percentage points ahead of peers, and a 1.81 Sharpe ratio suggest that investors have been reasonably rewarded for accepting the complexity and costs of its options overlay. The fund charges 0.55%, the ETF charges 0.48%. It’s a fascinating insight into the changing dynamics of the industry: the fund with the exceptional public record has drawn fewer assets in 40 months ($550 million) than the ETF has in 20 months. ($620 million). Capital Group Global Equity ETF (CGGE) is a global large‑cap core ETF that mimics American Funds Global Insight (AGVHX). Same management team, same discipline. Global Insight is an actively managed global large‑cap equity fund that aims for prudent long‑term growth of capital while seeking to limit downside risk. It invests mainly in established companies across the U.S. and international markets, with meaningful exposure to sectors like industrials, technology, and financials. It has a far larger non-US stake than its peers (44% versus 34%), low turnover, low Active Share, and more industrials (21% versus 13% for peers) than more. So far, that has not triggered a noticeable performance difference with its peers – it trails by 0.9% annually with a little less downside, leading to comparable Sharpe ratios. The ETF has performed exceptionally well, but that translates to “the ETF has operated for its first 16 months in a market that favored it;” its longer-term performance is likely to be another verse of the Global Insight song, “stodgy, cheap, reliable me!” The argument for the ETF is that it offers a more tax‑ and fee‑efficient wrapper. The ETF charges 0.47% on $1.4 billion in assets, the fund’s retail “A” shares ring in at 0.86% on $19 billion in assets. Palmer Square Credit Opportunities ETF (PSQO) is an actively managed, flexible multi‑asset credit strategy that allocates across CLOs, corporate bonds, ABS, and bank loans, drawing on Palmer Square’s existing opportunistic multi‑asset credit strategies and funds. Palmer Square frames it in terms of the opportunistic, relative‑value credit approach they’ve been running across separate accounts, funds, and other vehicles … but it does not identify one specific mutual fund or listed fund that PSQO is meant to replicate. The fund has only been around a year, but has dramatically outperformed its Global Income peer group in that period. The main “red flag” is that PSQO is a complex, opportunistic credit vehicle whose risk may only show up under real stress; it belongs firmly in the adventurous side of a bond sleeve, not as a core bond replacement.​ It has attracted about $107 million in assets over its first year of operation and charges 0.52%. Palmer Square CLO Senior Debt ETF (PSQA) tracks the Palmer Square CLO Senior Debt Index. Senior debt sits atop the stack of debts to get paid in the case of a default. As a general matter, CLO senior debt has returns like intermediate bonds but responds to a different set of risk factors. It is not high-yield debt, Palmer Square screens for securities with the equivalent of AA or AAA ratings, but like high-yield debt. CLO senior debt is sensitive to default or impairment rates but not sensitive to rising interest rates. The index has returned 3.46% annually since 2012 and 4.75% annually over the past five years, which sort of looks like this: The ETF itself has returned 5.9% in its first year with far better risk metrics than the average “loan participation” fund, so that its Sharpe ratio is twice as large. This strikes us as a “know what you own” story: structurally safer than mezzanine CLO exposure, but far from a simple investment‑grade bond fund, and not something to hold without tolerance for complexity and episodic drawdowns even if backward‑looking Sharpe ratios look excellent.​ Let’s start at Square One: I’m a fan of CrossingBridge. I’m amazed by the consistency with which David Sherman and his team have done exactly what they’ve promised: generated substantial upside with extremely well-managed downside in a collection of strategies that you can’t find elsewhere. I’m invested in two of their funds, Chip is invested in one, and MFO’s tiny “endowment” is, too. We wrote about CrossingBridge Nordic High Income Bond Fund (NRDCX) at its launch, and it has done well since. They seek high income and capital preservation while investing in bonds issued, originated, or underwritten in the Nordic countries. Part of the corporate DNA is a willingness to pursue small issues and event-driven ones that larger managers could not exploit. They see the Nordic markets as embodying a sort of gold standard for corporate governance and transparency, report that Nordic bonds represent better values than US high yield, and believe that the Nordic region has a distinctive market niche. For high-yield investors looking beyond the US, this is the quintessential “get this on your due diligence list” fund. Miller Market Neutral Income Fund (MMNIX) is a relative‑value, market‑neutral strategy that seeks positive total return with low correlation by emphasizing convertible and synthetic convertible structures, using long/short and hedging techniques to dampen broad equity and rate risk. To be clear, this isn’t the famous “Miller” and the CIO’s leadership of “Wellesley Asset Management” isn’t the Vanguard Wellesley. This Miller and this Wellesley are convertible bond specialists primarily serving an institutional clientele and managing about $2 billion in assets. At 9.8% APR, about 1.9 percentage points above its market‑neutral peers, and with a 3.80 Sharpe ratio, it fits our “alternatives with real risk‑adjusted payoff” preference, but (1) the 1.69% expense ratio is way high, and (2) it appears that it’s only available to institutional investors. I mention it here for the benefit of our professional readers who might have avenues to access a specialist shop’s flagship. SGI Enhanced Core ETF (USDX) is an “absolute‑return‑ish” bond and options hybrid that holds a diversified portfolio of high‑quality, short‑term money‑market instruments while running an actively traded put‑and‑call overlay on broad equity indices such as the S&P 500 to generate incremental income. Morningstar, by the way, likes no part of it. Or, more narrowly, Morningstar’s machine-learning analyst likes no part of it. That having been said, it’s posted pretty much top 1% returns since its launch about two years ago. The combination of very short‑duration fixed income and options‑driven yield is a sort of complexity trade: potentially smoother performance than long‑duration bonds, but with structural and behavioral risks that require some sophistication and tolerance for an expense ratio of 1.05% for a bond ETF. The advisor, Summit Global of Bountiful, Utah, manages about $760 million and advises five funds. Where to start, where to start? Hmmm … I really like the leadership of Bridgeway Capital, and once invited founder John Montgomery to speak to the students at the Institute for Leadership and Service at Augustana. That reflected two things: first, Bridgeway’s unswerving commitment to follow the evidence rather than the crowd, and their deep commitment to serving their community and their investors. John was obsessively cheap long before Vanguard and ETFs made it the vogue. Mr. Montgomery’s analysis of “the small company effect” led him to the conclusion that only the smallest of small companies – those in the so-called tenth decile – actually manifested it, and so their very first fund, Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company, which targeted companies so small that it had to have a hard close at just over $25 million. That having been said, the firm has seen relentless outflows and inconsistent performance over the past decade. So, here’s the story: Bridgeway Global Opportunities Fund (BRGOX) is trying to offer long-short “hedge fund” capabilities at mutual fund prices. It is an equity market‑neutral strategy that aims for long‑term positive absolute returns by running a roughly dollar‑neutral long/short portfolio in U.S. and foreign stocks. (Market-neutral and dollar-neutral translates to: our returns are independent of the stock market and currency fluctuations.) The key differentiator is Bridgeway’s work on “intangible capital” such as research & development spending. Accounting rules treat R&D as outflows, like the cost of buying coffee for the breakroom, not as investments. As a result, traditional metrics undervalue them. Here’s Bridgeway’s official description of what they do: Global Opportunities seeks consistent risk–adjusted absolute returns agnostic to market direction, with reduced volatility and granular diversification. Our systematic stock selection approach targets inefficiencies and opportunities in global markets. Innovations in accounting theory and financial analysis are employed to evaluate company fundamentals contextually, opening the opportunity to capitalize on slower price discovery in overlooked market segments. Limited discretion is applied when research assumptions do not hold. Our portfolio construction process is designed to emphasize idiosyncratic over systematic exposures. Bridgeway has published three peer-reviewed articles on the investment relevance of intangible capital, and the fund has done well so far. Bridgeway’s well‑documented commitment to donating a large share of profits to charity, its quantitative research ethos, and its history of sometimes brilliant but inconsistent funds make BRGOX feel like a high‑conviction expression of a very distinctive culture—one that investors may admire for its mission and process even if they should be cautious about extrapolating early‑stage performance.​ Final note, the fund charges a lot, 1.63% on assets of $34 million, if you think of it as a mutual fund, and not much at all if you think of it as a hedge fund. Your call! The flood of crypto derivatives and leveraged trading toys will wash out as it always does, leaving behind a small cohort of genuinely interesting opportunities. The lowest-risk rookies are precisely what MFO has always hunted for: experienced managers with solid, verifiable track records who are now available in new forms, whether that’s Capital Group’s franchise strategies wrapped in lower-cost ETFs, GMO’s institutional disciplines accessible to retail investors, or T. Rowe Price’s closed-to-new-money process extended into a complementary vehicle. These aren’t experiments or marketing plays. They’re proven managers bringing tested disciplines to investors who couldn’t previously access them. The question isn’t whether these strategies work, many have decades of demonstrating they do, but whether the new wrapper fits your portfolio. For serious investors willing to look past the noise, that’s a far more promising starting point than whatever Tesla-leveraged monstrosity launches next month. David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).

Let’s take stock. Waymo started testing its autonomous vehicles (with a safety monitor) in Philadelphia and will start manual driving to collect data in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh; Uber and Avride launched a robotaxi service in Dallas that will initially include a human safety operator behind the wheel; and the California Department of Motor Vehicles released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways in the state. Autonomous vehicle tech is scaling and the pace is quickening. But should it? As autonomous vehicle tech percolates into the cityscape, so has the criticism and challenges. A couple of recent incidents illustrate this point. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Waymo for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. The agency already opened an investigation into Waymo’s performance around school buses. Then there is KitKat, the bodega cat that died after a Waymo robotaxi ran him over on October 27. The company was already facing criticism over the event. And now it might escalate thanks to new video. The NYT tracked down surveillance video that shows a woman crouching beside the Waymo trying to lure KitKat to safety before the vehicle suddenly pulled away. A lot of changes have been happening at Lucid Motors recently, according to some little birds. As many of you already know, the company has lost a number of top executives, including former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson and most recently, chief designer Eric Bach. Lucid, which is in the middle of ramping up production of its Gravity SUV, has patched some of these vacancies with a mix of internal promotions and outside hires. And the changes keep coming. A few little birdies told us this week that a handful or more of top managers on its software and electrical teams were let go, including two senior directors who started with Lucid around a decade ago.

Electric aircraft maker Beta Technologies, which went public last month, is carving out a nice little supplier business for itself. Which is fitting since the Vermont-based company is aiming to be an OEM to the aviation sector. The company locked in a deal to supply air taxi company Eve Air Mobility with its electric pusher motors. Beta says the agreement is a potential 10-year opportunity valued at $1 billion. Of course, “potential” is an important hedge. That $1 billion is not guaranteed, even if shareholders translated it as such (stocks popped 8% following the news). Still, Beta is finding a near-term revenue path as it continues to work toward the commercial certification of its electric aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration. The company also reported its third-quarter earnings this week. Beta saw its revenue more than double to $8.9 million from the same quarter last year. Its net losses have also grown. Beta reported net losses of $452 million in the third quarter, a more than fivefold increase from the same year-ago period. Other deals that got my attention … Autolane, a Palo Alto-based startup developing the “air traffic control” for autonomous vehicles, raised $7.4 million in a round led by VC firms Draper Associates and Hyperplane. Element Fleet Management, an automotive fleet manager, acquired San Francisco-based connected vehicle payments company Car IQ. The terms weren’t disclosed, but sources with information on the deal told TechCrunch the acquisition price was $80 million. History lesson: back in 2024, Canada-based Element Fleet Management acquired fleet optimization software startup Autofleet for $110 million. ExploMar, a China-based developer of electric propulsion systems for boats, raised $10 million in a Series A round. The investment was jointly led by private equity funds and a listed company in China (not disclosed), with existing shareholder DCM Ventures continuing to participate. Heven AeroTech, a startup developing hydrogen-powered drones, raised $100 million in a Series B round led by American quantum computing company IonQ. The company’s post-money valuation is now more than $1 billion. Texas Venture Partners also participated. Wayve, the buzzy U.K. self-driving startup backed by Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank Group, acquired German startup Quality Match, which analyzes data used to train AI models for automated driving. Terms weren’t disclosed. Amazon is considering ending its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service and building out its own competing nationwide delivery network. Tesla owners can text and drive with the latest version of the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assistance software, despite the fact that it’s illegal to do so in most states. Grand Theft Auto Online has added robotaxis from a fictional-yet-familiar company dubbed “KnoWay,” whose sole purpose appears to be wreaking havoc. Nvidia announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research. TechCrunch’s Europe-based reporter Anna Heim gives an inside look at a drone delivery partnership in Finland. The Trump administration said it will lower fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States, arguing it will make vehicles more affordable. There’s a trade-off, though. Consumers could end up paying more for gas. The reduction essentially brings vehicles below what they’re achieving already. The proposal would roll fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations. Back before Thanksgiving, we did a poll in the Mobility newsletter asking, “When do you expect robotaxis to reach a tipping point of mass adoption that will affect how people move from Point A to Point B?” Most readers picked “before the end of the decade,” which received 47.2% of the vote, followed by the “2030s.” Based on your votes, there appears to be low confidence that 2026 will be the year of the tipping point.

Title: One Tech Tip: Up your Christmas shopping game with AI tools

By KELVIN CHAN and ANNE D’INNOCENZIO Shopping assistant chatbots were a novelty a year ago. Now, they’re everywhere. After rolling out AI-powered assistants, online retailers and tech companies have been adding more artificial intelligence features to make online shopping easier and more convenient. The latest crop of AI-powered shopping services and tools made their debut in recent weeks, just in time to kick off the holiday shopping season that begins with Black Friday. Here’s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas: Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience. Walmart’s Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant’s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it’s only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the “Ask Ralph” chatbot to provide style recommendations. The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they’re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth. The results, in my experience, can be mixed. I tried Rufus recently to find a replacement aftermarket stainless steel pot for my rice cooker, as well as a protective trivet for my kitchen sink faucet. In both cases, the results weren’t quite right and didn’t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable. I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings’ pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results. Perhaps you don’t want to limit yourself to a single retailer’s website in your Christmas shopping search. Or you’re not sure where exactly to find that perfect gift. Tech platforms have rolled out AI-powered shopping tools that can cast a wider net by searching multiple sites. OpenAI added a new “shopping research” feature to ChatGPT last week that can provide personalized buying advice for products that are heavy on detailed specs, like electronics or appliances. The feature will activate if you ask ChatGPT a shopping-related question or manually turn it on in the chat window. OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer. Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they’re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an “intelligently organized response” based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info. Google added similar shopping features to its Gemini AI chatbot app for U.S. users last month. Meanwhile, Perplexity unveiled its own shopping assistant feature last week that can tailor recommendations based on previous searches. I asked all three to find a soft cotton flannel shirt. Both ChatGPT and Perplexity asked me for specific requirements, such as budget and must-have features. ChatGPT’s response was the most detailed, with options from six brands including its top pick, and included pictures, prices and point-form summaries for each shirt. It also compiled the results into a comparison table. Results from Google, which didn’t ask follow up questions after my initial request, felt the most general. Perplexity’s results fell in between. So, you think you’ve found a stylish cardigan for your spouse. But you’re not sure about the silhouette or vibe. Generative AI “try on” tools let users see what a piece of clothing might look like on the wearer. Existing virtual dressing room tools have relied on complex 3D rendering, real photoshoots and augmented reality. Often, shoppers were limited to picking a model that best fit their body type to see how clothes fit. Google is now tapping AI to allow shoppers to virtually try on garments and shoes using pictures of themselves in simple poses. Among the exceptions: accessories like hats or jewelry, bathing suits and lingerie. To use this feature, which is available through Google’s shopping desktop search and mobile app in Australia, Japan Canada and the U.S., just tap the “Try it on” button on a product’s photo and then add a full-length photo of yourself. You can then save the image of yourself with the tested item or share it. The original photo is also saved to your account so you don’t need to keep uploading fresh images. If you’re shopping for a gift for someone, Google says you can upload their photo, but only if you have their permission. Now that you’ve figured out what exactly to get for those special people on your Christmas gift list, it’s time to buy. But if you want to outsource some of the legwork involved, there are “agentic AI” tools that can help. Amazon users can use an “AI agent” to buy a product on their behalf if the price falls to a desired level. Google has launched its own “agentic checkout” feature, which can automatically buy a product you’re keeping an eye on with its price-tracking feature. Google’s feature has rolled out to a small group of retailers, including Wayfair, Chewy and Quince we well as some Shopify merchants. Both companies say they’ll always confirm with you before the AI agent makes the purchase. Amazon is taking it a step further by allowing shoppers to buy items that aren’t in stock directly from other brands’ websites. If you see a product on the Amazon Shopping app with a “Buy For Me” button, you can buy it through the usual Amazon checkout page but the AI agent will then carry out the transaction on the other brand’s website with your encrypted payment details. The feature was in test mode but is being rolled out more widely. Prefer to buy in person? It’s a good idea to make sure a bricks-and-mortar shop has the product you want before heading over. Google has launched an AI service that will call local stores to ask. It’s only available in the U.S. for toys, electronics and health and beauty products. When doing a Google search for the product you want, add “near me” to the end of your search query. Then, if you see “Let Google Call” when scrolling through the results, you can tap the “Get started” button. Answer some questions about what you’re shopping for, whether you want updates by email or text. Google will then contact stores near your location to ask if the item is in stock. The bot works swiftly but results might be limited. When an AP reporter in New Jersey asked Google to call around about a specific Acer monitor, the agent returned quickly with a reply from a local computer repair shop that sold refurbished monitors. It appeared to ignore nearby big-box outlets selling electronics. According to Google’s text update, the local repair shop didn’t have the monitor, but did have a similar-sized one — sans the other bells and whistles — for a lower price.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. In this section of the November 2025 episode of FO° Exclusive, Atul Singh and Glenn Carle examine growing fears that the US stock market has become detached from economic reality. Inequality, weakening consumer demand and policy time lags now increase systemic risk. Mounting fiscal strain, tariff uncertainty and global diversification away from the dollar make a significant market correction increasingly plausible. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Editor-in-Chief Atul Singh and FOI Senior Partner Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who now advises companies, governments and organizations on geopolitical risk, discuss rising fears of a US stock market bubble, with particular attention to technology and artificial intelligence. Their concern is not simply that equities are expensive, but that today’s valuations reflect expectations the real economy may be unable to meet. Drawing on warnings by market experts, fiscal data and consumer indicators, they argue that the American economy is showing strains beneath the surface while markets continue to price in near-perfect economic conditions. The gap between financial optimism and economic reality, they suggest, is widening dangerously. The AI boom and extreme market concentration Atul opens by highlighting warnings from Albert Edwards, the global strategist at French bank Société Générale, who sees the US equity market — especially tech and AI stocks — in the midst of a classic bubble. Some major technology firms are trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings, a level Atul calls “a ridiculous figure.” These valuations, Edwards argues, leave little margin for error. The discussion stresses that such optimism depends on extraordinary assumptions. Citing estimates from JPMorgan Chase, Atul notes that for companies to earn a 10% return on projected AI capital expenditure by 2030, they would collectively need around $650 billion in annual AI revenues — roughly $400 per year from every iPhone user. While some fund managers remain bullish, arguing AI-led productivity gains justify this optimism, many investors view the revenue assumptions as implausible. Market gains are also highly concentrated. Roughly 60% of recent stock market growth has come from just seven firms: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The remaining 40% of the market is up as well, but far less dramatically. This concentration amplifies systemic risk, as any correction among a handful of firms could reverberate across the entire market. Inequality, consumers and the fragile base of demand The US economy ultimately depends on consumer demand, even if that reality is often obscured by soaring asset prices. Glenn underlines that consumption today is increasingly driven by the wealthy. Around 80–86% of the gains from recent tax cuts have flowed to the top 1% of Americans, while the bottom 80% have seen little or no growth in disposable income for years. This imbalance matters because wealthy households cannot replace mass demand. Glenn sums it up starkly: “1,000 billionaires cannot buy as many cars as 100 million lower-middle-class Americans.” If middle- and lower-middle-class consumers cannot afford homes, cars or basic goods, economic momentum weakens regardless of stock prices. Atul turns the conversation to the declining role of entrepreneurs. Building small, innovative firms has become much more difficult as large corporations dominate markets. Historically, smaller companies have driven job creation and experimentation in both the US and Europe. Their erosion, Glenn adds, pushes the economy toward oligopoly — less competition, weaker innovation and slower long-term growth. Time lags, tariffs and mounting economic strain A central theme of the discussion is what Glenn calls the “lag factor” in economic policy. Despite commentators’ claims that new tariffs have had little immediate impact, policy effects take time. Even small changes in short-term interest rates can take around six months to affect the economy, while longer-term rates and fiscal measures often take 18 months or more. Dismissing these delays may prove dangerous. Although tariff revenues have risen and trade flows have not collapsed, uncertainty itself is already affecting behavior. CEOs faced with shifting rules and arbitrary implementation hesitate to make long-term investment decisions. Supporters inside the Trump administration counter by likening the US market to a Disneyland theme park, arguing that trading partners will continue to accept lower margins because there is no substitute — a view closely associated with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who administration insiders credit with engineering a delicate balancing act between trade pressure and market stability. Supporters also point to the US–China trade deal, which they argue removed Chinese export controls on rare earths, halted retaliation against US semiconductor firms and reopened Chinese markets to American agricultural exports. Critics respond that this confidence underestimates how quickly countries adapt when costs rise. Glenn points to rising housing costs, weak youth employment, a growing deficit and slowing construction as indicators of a slowdown in the economy. Atul reinforces this view with insider insights from within Washington, DC. Sources in the US Treasury worry not just about tariffs, but about affordability, cost-of-living pressures and weakening demand. Meanwhile, headline fiscal numbers are troubling. US debt is projected to exceed that of Italy and Greece for the first time this century, while the budget deficit remains near 6% in peacetime. Demand, dislocation and a possible crash Beyond near-term indicators, Atul and Glenn raise a deeper structural concern: demand in an AI-driven economy. Even if AI significantly boosts production and efficiency, it may also displace jobs faster than new ones emerge. Atul likens the situation to the late 1920s, when productivity surged, but demand failed to keep pace, ending in a market collapse. Signs of stress are already showing. University of Michigan consumer confidence fell to 50.3 in November, the second-worst reading ever recorded — worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 Covid-19 downturn. Household balance sheets are also deteriorating: roughly 4.5% of US household debt is now delinquent, while student-loan delinquencies have reached record levels. Youth unemployment has climbed above 8%, and job-search times are lengthening. Simultaneously, while the dollar remains the world’s main trading currency, it is declining as a store of value. Central banks and investors are diversifying away from the mighty greenback. Even allies like Canada are actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US market through shifting trade, tourism and even defense procurement decisions. Importantly, rising market volatility presents a major risk, with the Cboe Volatility Index crossing the 20 mark, signaling higher-than-normal expected market volatility and increased investor uncertainty or fear Investors and economists are increasingly talking of an impending crash. These predictions might be a bit too pessimistic, but dismissing them would be reckless. As Atul puts it, “just because there’s a lot of talk about it doesn’t mean that it is all talk.” Together, the indicators paint a consistent picture: an irrational exuberance in markets, an economy under increasing strains and a growing risk that economic realities upend ebullient markets.

Title: The Reverse-Centaur's Guide to Criticizing AI

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I gave a speech for the University of Washington's "Neuroscience, AI and Society" lecture series, through the university's Computational Neuroscience Center. It was called "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI," and it's based on the manuscript for my next book, "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Life After AI," which will be out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux next June: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139 The talk was sold out, but here's the text of my lecture. I'm very grateful to UW for the opportunity, and for a lovely visit to Seattle! == I'm a science fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. What I don't do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean that what we all do couldn't change it. It would mean that the future was arriving on fixed rails and couldn't be steered. Jesus Christ, what a miserable proposition! Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think sf writers are oracles, soothsayers. Unfortunately, even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that they can "see the future." But for every sf writer who deludes themselves into thinking that they are writing the future, there are a hundred sf fans who believe that they are reading the future, and a depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. The fact that these guys can't shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI. That's a thing I strenuously resisted doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentless bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn't understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, insisted that I must be a paid shill. This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is Just. Too. Short. So I didn't want to get lured into another one of those quagmires, because on the one hand, I just don't think AI is that important of a technology, and on the other hand, I have very nuanced and complicated views about what's wrong, and not wrong, about AI, and it takes a long time to explain that stuff. But people wouldn't stop asking, so I did what I always do. I wrote a book. Over the summer I wrote a book about what I think about AI, which is really about what I think about AI criticism, and more specifically, how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: "How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm." I titled the book The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish it in June, 2026. But you don't have to wait until then because I am going to break down the entire book's thesis for you tonight, over the next 40 minutes. I am going to talk fast. # Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a "centaur" is a person who is assisted by a machine. You're a human head being carried around on a tireless robot body. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete. And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine. Like an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras, that monitor the driver's eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver's mouth because singing isn't allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they don't make quota. The driver is in that van because the van can't drive itself and can't get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance. But the driver is human, so the van doesn't just use the driver. The van uses the driver up. Obviously, it's nice to be a centaur, and it's horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaur-like, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse-centaurs, which is something none of us want to be. But like I said, the job of an sf writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it's technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it's technologically impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you think that it's impossible for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite. This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher's mantra was "There is no alternative." She repeated this so often they called her "TINA" Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative. TINA. "There is no alternative" is a cheap rhetorical slight. It's a demand dressed up as an observation. "There is no alternative" means "STOP TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE." Which, you know, fuck that. I'm an sf writer, my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast. So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality, and explain how I think we could and should all be better AI critics. # Start with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don't compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels. Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20 billion/year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% Search market-share. Now, you'd think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector. But it's actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a "growth stock," and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you're making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the "price to earnings ratio" or "P/E ratio." But once a company stops growing, it is a "mature" stock, and it trades at a much lower P/E ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth ten dollars. It has a P/E ratio of 10, while Amazon has a P/E ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36. It's wonderful to run a company that's got a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company, or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeroes into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors. So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition, or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeroes into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us, or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars. That's the upside of having a growth stock. But here's the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you gonna grow? Once the market decides that you aren't a growth stock, once you become mature, your stock is revalued, to a P/E ratio befitting a mature stock. If you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you're not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the USA than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240B sell off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history. That's a monopolist's worst nightmare, because once you're presiding over a "mature" firm, the key employees you've been compensating with stock, experience a precipitous pay-drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars. With dollars, not shares. And the same goes for acquiring companies that might help you grow, because they, too, are going to expect money, not stock. This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they don't trust your pricing power. Which is why growth stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video, or cryptocurrency, or NFTs, or Metaverse, or AI. I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. So this is why they're hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment. # Now I want to talk about how they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use "disrupt" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense. The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company. That's it. That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security. Now, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We'd have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people. But AI can't do your job. It can help you do your job, but that doesn't mean it's going to save anyone money. Take radiology: there's some evidence that AIs can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss, and look, I've got cancer. Thankfully, it's very treatable, but I've got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible. If my Kaiser hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: "Hey folks, here's the deal. Today, you're processing about 100 x-rays per day. From now on, we're going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you've missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you're only processing 98 x-rays per day. That's fine, we just care about finding all those tumors." If that's what they said, I'd be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market's bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: "Look, you fire 9/10s of your radiologists, saving $20m/year, you give us $10m/year, and you net $10m/year, and the remaining radiologists' job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed, and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it's catastrophically wrong. "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist's fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis." This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes. This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble. If you're someone who's worried about cancer, and you're being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we're going to have to re-home America's 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say, "Well, OK, I'm sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I'm on." AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs' labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers. Now, some people will be on the workers' side because of politics or aesthetics. They just like workers better than their bosses. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you. Will those products be substandard? There's every reason to think so. Earlier, I alluded to "automation blindness, "the physical impossibility of remaining vigilant for things that rarely occur. This is why TSA agents are incredibly good at spotting water bottles. Because they get a ton of practice at this, all day, every day. And why they fail to spot the guns and bombs that government red teams smuggle through checkpoints to see how well they work, because they just don't have any practice at that. Because, to a first approximation, no one deliberately brings a gun or a bomb through a TSA checkpoint. Automation blindness is the Achilles' heel of "humans in the loop." Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI, and almost without exception, they are senior, experienced coders, who get to decide how they will use these tools. For example, you might ask the AI to generate a set of CSS files to faithfully render a web-page across multiple versions of multiple browsers. This is a notoriously fiddly thing to do, and it's pretty easy to verify if the code works – just eyeball it in a bunch of browsers. Or maybe the coder has a single data file they need to import and they don't want to write a whole utility to convert it. Tasks like these can genuinely make coders more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it's clear they're not looking to make some centaurs. They want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AIs' code. And because AI is just a word guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are literally statistically indistinguishable from working code (except that they're bugs). Here's an example: code libraries are standard utilities that programmers can incorporate into their apps, so they don't have to do a bunch of repetitive programming. Like, if you want to process some text, you'll use a standard library. If it's an HTML file, that library might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it's a DOCX file, it'll be lib.docx.text.parsing. But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there's another library, this one for parsing PDFs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it's called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Now, because the AI is a statistical inference engine, because all it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past, it will "hallucinate" a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into your program, and it will do things like steal user data or try and penetrate other computers on the same network. And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard to find error, this bug that is literally statistically indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they've been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire. But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don't think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company's top management. The kind of coder who'd lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google ten billion dollars in 2018. For AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the experienced workers, with process knowledge, and hard-won intuition, who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors. Like I said, the point here is to replace high-waged workers. And one of the reasons the AI companies are so anxious to fire coders is that coders are the princes of labor. They're the most consistently privileged, sought-after, and well-compensated workers in the labor force. If you can replace coders with AI, who cant you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI. Which brings me to AI art. AI art – or "art" – is also an ad for AI, but it's not part of AI's business model. Let me explain: on average, illustrators don't make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precartized groups of workers out there. They suffer from a pathology called "vocational awe." That's a term coined by the librarian Fobazi Ettarh, and it refers to workers who are vulnerable to workplace exploitation because they actually care about their jobs – nurses, librarians, teachers, and artists. If AI image generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of Open AI's campuses. The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death-knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It's to create buzz. Which is not to say that it's not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that "some creative jobs shouldn't have been there in the first place," and that it's not especially disgusting that she and her colleagues boast about using the work of artists to ruin those artists' livelihoods. It's supposed to be disgusting. It's supposed to get artists to run around and say, "The AI can do my job, and it's going to steal my job, and isn't that terrible?" Because the customers for AI – corporate bosses – don't see AI taking workers' jobs as terrible. They see it as wonderful. But can AI do an illustrator's job? Or any artist's job? Let's think about that for a second. I've been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story, and I've given it a lot of thought, and here's what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, or a poem, or a painting, or a drawing, or a dance, or a book, or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind. Now that I've defined art, we have to go on a little detour. I have a friend who's a law professor, and before the rise of chatbots, law students knew better than to ask for reference letters from their profs, unless they were a really good student. Because those letters were a pain in the ass to write. So if you advertised for a postdoc and you heard from a candidate with a reference letter from a respected prof, the mere existence of that letter told you that the prof really thought highly of that student. But then we got chatbots, and everyone knows that you generate a reference letter by feeding three bullet points to an LLM, and it'll barf up five paragraphs of florid nonsense about the student. So when my friend advertises for a postdoc, they are flooded with reference letters, and they deal with this flood by feeding all these letters to another chatbot, and ask it to reduce them back to three bullet points. Now, obviously, they won't be the same bullet-points, which makes this whole thing terrible. But just as obviously, nothing in that five-paragraph letter except the original three bullet points are relevant to the student. The chatbot doesn't know the student. It doesn't know anything about them. It cannot add a single true or useful statement about the student to the letter. What does this have to do with AI art? Art is a transfer of a big, numinous, irreducible feeling from an artist to someone else. But the image-gen program doesn't know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero. It's possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or The Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, or interesting, or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human. And in the meantime, it's bad art. It's bad art in the sense of being "eerie," the word Mark Fisher uses to describe "when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something." AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it's missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it's undetectable. The images were striking before we figured out the trick, but now they're just like the images we imagine in clouds or piles of leaves. We're the ones drawing a frame around part of the scene, we're the ones focusing on some contours and ignoring the others. We're looking at an inkblot, and it's not telling us anything. Sometimes that can be visually arresting, and to the extent that it amuses people in a community of prompters and viewers, that's harmless. I know someone who plays a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game over Zoom. It's transcribed by an open source model running locally on the dungeon master's computer, which summarizes the night's session and prompts an image generator to create illustrations of key moments. These summaries and images are hilarious because they're full of errors. It's a bit of harmless fun, and it bring a small amount of additional pleasure to a small group of people. No one is going to fire an illustrator because D&D players are image-genning funny illustrations where seven-fingered paladins wrestle with orcs that have an extra hand. But bosses have and will fire illustrators, because they fantasize about being able to dispense with creative professionals and just prompt an AI. Because even though the AI can't do the illustrator's job, an AI salesman can convince the illustrator's boss to fire them and replace them with an AI that can't do their job. This is a disgusting and terrible juncture, and we should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism's fatalism: "There is no alternative." So what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model. And I'm here to tell you they are wrong: wrong because this would inflict terrible collateral damage on socially beneficial activities, and it would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason!. Let's break down the steps in AI training. First, you scrape a bunch of web-pages. This is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. You do not need a license to make a transient copy of a copyrighted work in order to analyze it, otherwise search engines would be illegal. Ban scraping and Google will be the last search engine we ever get, the Internet Archive will go out of business, that guy in Austria who scraped all the grocery store sites and proved that the big chains were colluding to rig prices would be in deep trouble. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for. It's just not illegal to count the elements of a copyrighted work. And we really don't want it to be, not if you're interested in scholarship of any kind. And it's important to note that counting things is legal, even if you're working from an illegally obtained copy. Like, if you go to the flea market, and you buy a bootleg music CD, and you take it home and you make a list of all the adverbs in the lyrics, and you publish that list, you are not infringing copyright by doing so. Perhaps you've infringed copyright by getting the pirated CD, but not by counting the lyrics. This is why Anthropic offered a $1.5b settlement for training its models based on a ton of books it downloaded from a pirate site: not because counting the words in the books infringes anyone's rights, but because they were worried that they were going to get hit with $150k/book statutory damages for downloading the files. OK, after you count all the pixels or the words, it's time for the final step: publishing them. Because that's what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array. And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which truthful, factual statements you can publish. But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I'm full of shit. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first time someone thought that. After all, even if I'm right about how copyright works now, there's no reason we couldn't change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there's even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don't like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing. Well, even then, you're not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. If you're thinking that you can, you need to grapple with this fact: we have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer. And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also: the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than its ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators' bosses at the media company. So how it is that we have given all these new rights to creators, and those new rights have generated untold billions, and left creators poorer? It's because in a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming "think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!" Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what's good for you. The day Disney and Universal filed suit against Midjourney, I got a press release from the RIAA, which represents Disney and Universal through their recording arms. Universal is the largest label in the world. Together with Sony and Warner, they control 70% of all music recordings in copyright today. It starts: "There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry." It ends: "This action by Disney and Universal represents a critical stand for human creativity and responsible innovation." And it's signed by Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA. It's very likely that name doesn't mean anything to you. But let me tell you who Mitch Glazier is. Today, Mitch Glazier is the CEO if the RIAA, with an annual salary of $1.3m. But until 1999, Mitch Glazier was a key Congressional staffer, and in 1999, Glazier snuck an amendment into an unrelated bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, that killed musicians' right to take their recordings back from their labels. This is a practice that had been especially important to "heritage acts" (which is a record industry euphemism for "old music recorded by Black people"), for whom this right represented the difference between making rent and ending up on the street. When it became clear that Glazier had pulled this musician-impoverishing scam, there was so much public outcry, that Congress actually came back for a special session, just to vote again to cancel Glazier's amendment. And then Glazier was kicked out of his cushy Congressional job, whereupon the RIAA started paying more than $1m/year to "represent the music industry." This is the guy who signed that press release in my inbox. And his message was: The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to train a Gen AI model on copyrighted works, and then use that model to put artists on the breadline. The problem is that Midjourney didn't pay RIAA members Universal and Disney for permission to train a model. Because if only Midjourney had given Disney and Universal several million dollars for training rights to their catalogs, the companies would have happily allowed them to train to their heart's content, and they would have bought the resulting models, and fired as many creative professionals as they could. I mean, have we already forgotten the Hollywood strikes? I sure haven't. I live in Burbank, home to Disney, Universal and Warner, and I was out on the line with my comrades from the Writers Guild, offering solidarity on behalf of my union, IATSE 830, The Animation Guild, where I'm a member of the writers' unit. And I'll never forget when one writer turned to me and said, "You know, you prompt an LLM exactly the same way an exec gives shitty notes to a writers' room. You know: 'Make me ET, except it's about a dog, and put a love interest in there, and a car chase in the second act.' The difference is, you say that to a writers' room and they all make fun of you and call you a fucking idiot suit. But you say it to an LLM and it will cheerfully shit out a terrible script that conforms exactly to that spec (you know, Air Bud)." These companies are desperate to use AI to displace workers. When Getty Images sues AI companies, it's not representing the interests of photographers. Getty hates paying photographers! Getty just wants to get paid for the training run, and they want the resulting AI model to have guardrails, so it will refuse to create images that compete with Getty's images for anyone except Getty. But Getty will absolutely use its models to bankrupt as many photographers as it possibly can. A new copyright to train models won't get us a world where models aren't used to destroy artists, it'll just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss, a human shield they can brandish in policy fights, a tissue-thin pretense of "won't someone think of the hungry artists?" When really what they're demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders' pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal? We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment. And incredibly enough, there's a really simple way to do that. After 20+ years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists' rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That's why the "monkey selfie" is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium. And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they've defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle. The fact that every AI created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them, or give them away for free. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission. The US Copyright Office's position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you're a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that's no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you're a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd-scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted. But creative workers don't have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers' strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in "sectoral bargaining," whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector. That's been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright. Our allies in a campaign to expand copyright are our bosses, who have never had our best interests at heart. While our allies in the fight for sector bargaining are every worker in the country. As the song goes, "Which side are you on?" OK, I need to bring this talk in for a landing now, because I'm out of time, so I'm going to close out with this: AI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible. Bubbles transfer the life's savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it. But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It's still in the ground. At my home, I've got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber. All things being equal, it would have been better if Worldcom hadn't ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage. I don't think we'll salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. Sure, there'll be a few coders who've learned something about secure programming in Rust. But when crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey JPEGs. AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the data-centers will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind? We'll have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We'll have a lot of cheap GPUs, which'll be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who'll be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we'll have the open source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video, describing images, summarizing documents, automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing, like removing backgrounds, or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamt of. If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps for back-propagation, machine learning and generative adversarial networks, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We'd call them "plugins." It's the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn't want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, "disruptive" things: Big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year. When the AI investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won't be economical to keep the data-centers running. As Stein's Law has it: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100b IOU. Bosses are mass-firing productive workers and replacing them with janky AI, and when the janky AI is gone, no one will be able to find and re-hire most of those workers, we're going to go from disfunctional AI systems to nothing. AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more. So we need to get rid of this bubble. Pop it, as quickly as we can. To do that, we have to focus on the material factors driving the bubble. The bubble isn't being driven by deepfake porn, or election disinformation, or AI image-gen, or slop advertising. All that stuff is terrible and harmful, but it's not driving investment. The total dollar figure represented by these apps doesn't come close to making a dent in the capital expenditures and operating costs of AI. They are peripheral, residual uses: flashy, but unimportant to the bubble. Get rid of all those uses and you reduce the expected income of AI companies by a sum so small it rounds to zero. Same goes for all that "AI Safety" nonsense, that purports to concern itself with preventing an AI from attaining sentience and turning us all into paperclips. First of all, this is facially absurd. Throwing more words and GPUs into the word-guessing program won't make it sentient. That's like saying, "Well, we keep breeding these horses to run faster and faster, so it's only a matter of time until one of our mares gives birth to a locomotive." A human mind is not a word-guessing program with a lot of extra words. I'm here for science fiction thought experiments, don't get me wrong. But also, don't mistake sf for prophesy. SF stories about superintelligence are futuristic parables, not business plans, roadmaps, or predictions. The AI Safety people say they are worried that AI is going to end the world, but AI bosses love these weirdos. Because on the one hand, if AI is powerful enough to destroy the world, think of how much money it can make! And on the other hand, no AI business plan has a line on its revenue projections spreadsheet labeled "Income from turning the human race into paperclips." So even if we ban AI companies from doing this, we won't cost them a dime in investment capital. To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side. Because the AI bubble really is very bad news, it's worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with high-tech asbestos.

Title: Millionaire YouTuber Hank Green tells Gen Z to rethink their Tesla bets—and shares the portfolio changes he’s making to avoid AI-bubble fallout
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/07/millionaire-youtuber-hank-green-investing-tips-gen-z-invest-in-market-avoid-ai-bubble-diversification/
Time Published: 2025-12-07T12:05:00Z
Full Content:
For years, YouTube star Hank Green has stuck to the same straightforward investing wisdom touted by legends like Warren Buffett: Put your money in an S&P 500 index fund and leave it alone. It’s advice that has paid off handsomely for millions of investors: This year alone, the index is up roughly some 16% and averaged more than 20% in gains over the past three years and roughly 14.6% over the past two decades. In most cases, it has easily beaten investors who try to pick individual stocks like Tesla or Meta. But as Wall Street frets over a possible AI-driven bubble—with voices from Big Short investor Michael Burry to economist Mohamed El-Erian sounding alarms—Green isn’t waiting around to see what happens. He’s already rethinking how much of his own wealth is tied to Big Tech. A major reason: The S&P 500 is more concentrated than ever. The top 10 companies—including Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta—make up nearly 40% of the entire index. And nearly all of them are pouring billions into AI. “I feel like my money is more exposed than I would like it to be,” Green said in a video that’s racked up over 1.6 million views. “I feel like by virtue of having a lot of my money in the S&P 500, I am now kind of betting on a big AI future. And that’s not a future that I definitely think is going to happen.” So Green is hedging. He’s taking 25% of the money he previously invested in S&P 500 index funds—a meaningful chunk for a self-made millionaire—and moving it into a more diversified set of assets, including: Green’s thesis is simple: Even if AI transforms the economy, the biggest winners may ultimately not be the mega-cap companies building the models. “I think that these giant companies providing the AI models will actually be competing with each other for those customers in part by competing on price,” Green said. “And that might mean that the value delivered to small companies will be bigger than value delivered to the big AI companies. Who knows, though? I just think that’s a thing that could happen.” And if his concerns are overblown? He’s fine with that, too. “If I’m wrong, 75% of my money is still in the safe place that everybody says your money should be, which is the S&P 500.” Gen Z continues to trail other generations in financial know-how—from saving and investing to understanding risk, according to TIAA. Moreover, one in four admit they are not confident in their financial knowledge and skill—a stark admission considering that one in seven Gen Z credit card users have maxed out their credit cards and many young people hold thousands in student loan debt. As a self-described “middle-aged, 45-year-old successful person,” Green said he’s trying to model what thoughtful, long-term decision-making actually looks like. And part of that effort includes dispelling one big misconception shared among some of his audience: “I get these comments from people who are like, I can’t believe that you’re participating in this Ponzi scheme,” Green told Fortune. “I do want to alienate those people, because I don’t believe that the stock market is a Ponzi scheme. I do think that it’s overvalued right now, but I think that it’s tied to real value that’s really created in the world.” His broader point: Investing isn’t about vibes or just dumping money into the hot stock of the week; rather, it’s something to seriously research. “A lot of people think that investing is like getting a Robinhood account and buying Tesla,” Green added. “And I’m like, ‘Nope, you’ve got to get a Fidelity account and buy a low-cost index fund everybody and or just keep it in your 401(k) and let the people who manage it manage it’—which is what a lot of people do, which is also fine.” His younger viewers are paying attention. One popular comment summed it up: “As a young person entering the point in my life where I’m starting to think about investing, I really appreciate you talking through your logic and giving a ton of disclaimers rather than telling me I should buy buy buy exactly what you buy buy buy.” The comment has already racked up more than 4,700 likes. While Green doesn’t come from a financial background, experts from the world of investing said they agree largely with his rationale: Having a diversified portfolio is the way to go—especially if you have worries about an AI bubble. “Unlike many dotcom companies, today’s tech giants generally have substantial revenue, cash reserves, and established business models beyond just AI,” certified financial planner Bo Hanson, host of The Money Guy Show, said in a video analyzing Green’s take. “Still, the concentration risk remains a valid concern for investors that are seeking diversification. However, this is precisely why we advise against putting all investments solely in the S&P 500, especially if you have a shorter time horizon.” Hanson added wise investors spread their money across various asset classes, including small-caps, international, and bonds, in order to reduce portfolio volatility and provide more consistent returns across various market environments. It’s sentiment echoed by Doug Ornstein, director at TIAA Wealth Management, who said it’s important to realize that not every investment needs to chase growth. “Particularly as you get older, having guaranteed income streams becomes crucial. Products like annuities can provide reliable payments regardless of market swings, creating a foundation of financial security,” Ornstein told Fortune. “Think of it as building a floor beneath your portfolio—one that market volatility can’t touch.”

An Axon body camera is worn by MSGT Matt Gilmore who is one of the officers using Axon’s Draft One AI software at OKCPD headquarters on Friday, May 31, 2024 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. (AP Photo/Nick Oxford, File) Police body cameras equipped with artificial intelligence have been trained to detect the faces of about 7,000 people on a “high risk” watch list in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a live test of whether facial recognition technology shunned as too intrusive could have a place in policing throughout North America. But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project — switched on last week— is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent’s northernmost city of more than 1 million people. A former chair of Axon’s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he’s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications. “It’s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there’s some clear indication of the benefits,” said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University. Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but “early-stage field research” that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly. “By testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,” Smith wrote in a blog post. The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a “flag or caution” for categories such as “violent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,” said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said. “We really want to make sure that it’s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,” said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon’s director of responsible AI. If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has “intentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.” It didn’t rule out using it in the future. The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints. While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police. Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn’t match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots. Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump’s administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI. The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism. But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country. Many details about Edmonton’s pilot haven’t been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn’t make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses. Edmonton police say the pilot will continue through the end of December and only during daylight hours. “Obviously it gets dark pretty early here,” Martin said. “Lighting conditions, our cold temperatures during the wintertime, all those things will factor into what we’re looking at in terms of a successful proof of concept.” Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won’t know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there’s a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said. That’s only supposed to happen if officers have started an investigation or are responding to a call, not simply while strolling through a crowd. Martin said officers responding to a call can switch their cameras from a passive to an active recording mode with higher-resolution imaging. “We really want to respect individuals’ rights and their privacy interests,” Martin said. The office of Alberta’s information and privacy commissioner Diane McLeod said she received a privacy impact assessment from Edmonton police on Dec. 2, the same day Axon and police officials announced the program. The office said Friday it’s now working to review the assessment, a requirement for projects that collect “high sensitivity” personal data. University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he’s not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments. “Edmonton is a laboratory for this tool,” Oriola said. “It may well turn out to be an improvement, but we do not know that for sure.” Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes “frosty” relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public. Axon has faced blowback for its technology deployments in the past, as in 2022, when Friedman and seven other members of Axon’s AI ethics board resigned in protest over concerns about a Taser-equipped drone. In the years since Axon opted against facial recognition, Smith, the CEO, says the company has “continued controlled, lab-based research” of a technology that has “become significantly more accurate” and is now ready for trial in the real world. But Axon acknowledged in a statement to the AP that all facial recognition systems are affected by “factors like distance, lighting and angle, which can disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.” Every match requires human review, Axon said, and part of its testing is also “learning what training and oversight human reviewers must have to mitigate known risks.” Friedman said Axon should disclose those evaluations. He’d want to see more evidence that facial recognition has improved since his board concluded that it wasn’t reliable enough to ethically justify its use in police cameras. Friedman said he’s also concerned about police agencies greenlighting the technology’s use without deliberation by local legislators and rigorous scientific testing. “It’s not a decision to be made simply by police agencies and certainly not by vendors,” he said. “A pilot is a great idea. But there’s supposed to be transparency, accountability. ... None of that’s here. They’re just going ahead. They found an agency willing to go ahead and they’re just going ahead.” —- AP writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Why Digital IDs, CBDCs, and UBI Will Be Eagerly Welcome
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/why-digital-ids-cbdcs-and-ubi-will-be-eagerly-welcome/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T23:00:00Z

Most people don’t understand why Digital IDs and CBDCs will soon be welcomed by the masses. Here’s the story so far… Recently, there has been a lot of talk about poverty. Mostly because during the government shutdown, the federal government food program, SNAP, ran out of funding. Out of some 330+ Million Americans, 42 million rely on SNAP to supplement their grocery purchases every month. In New York State alone, $770 million is spent by the federal government every month, and California, over $1 Billion. It’s a big deal. As a result, there was a world’s share of celebrity lip-wagging and open wallets. Pop Star, Billie Eilish reportedly donated 25% of her wealth to those solving hunger in the United States. She also did as much as she could to call out billionaires like Elon Musk. Billie Eilish had a message for billionaires at the WSJ Innovator Awards: “Give your money away, shorties."Eilish was one of eight who was honored for her work. At the event, Stephen Colbert announced Eilish is donating $11.5 million of the proceeds from her most recent tour to… pic.twitter.com/K555kWDTZj Musk’s response, he’s going to solve poverty the same way every other technocrat envisions: Poverty can and will be eliminated, but envy is eternal https://t.co/WHn0l2CruD On top of the affordability crisis, there is the more important matter of continual job losses, which are in continual decline across the United States. Tech firms are downsizing while increasing their use of AI. Retail stores are shuttering their doors. Even in Las Vegas, tourism is slowing down. It’s well known as America’s discretionary spending capital. And when spending slows down for the world’s oldest profession, you know you’re in trouble. All of that sounds a bit alarmist, but here’s what I want to highlight. Because AI is reducing the amount of jobs available, AI is also becoming the answer. Although, AI job losses have not yet created a good crisis the government can use to implement Universal Basic Income(UBI). It has not stopped them from promoting it as THE solution. In fact, it is almost becoming universally accepted (even among the contrarians) that UBI WILL be the solution. Bert Dohmen at Dohmen Capital Research writes: The Problems of AI Are Now Being Exposed “The tremendous gains in “productivity” due to AI, which we forecasted, are already emerging now. Even the president’s economic advisor Hassett talked about rising productivity and the many benefits that AI will have on the economy earlier this month. Productivity will continue to soar with AI, which means that each worker that still has a job will be able to produce much more. However, millions of other workers will lose their jobs. The loss of jobs is a negative, so UBI, Universal Basic Income, will surface and send unemployed people a weekly check. The big tech firms are already having huge layoffs such as 30,000 from Amazon and 15,000 from Microsoft. And they are not just low level, but high income middle level people. That income will be missing in the economy.” Here’s what Musk means by solving poverty: Elon Musk, speaking at the World Government Summit: "I think ultimately we will have to have some kind of universal basic income… I think it's going to be necessary.""There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better… The much harder challenge is, how do… pic.twitter.com/mM3wRmJDrL What Most People Think About UBI Most people are still arguing about the top 3 most widely believed problems with UBI: In the world of the technocrats, those are just kinks to be worked out. When in reality, all the talk about digital slavery and the Total State controlling every aspect of your life will only make a lesser version more readily acceptable. Many financial commentators and marketers, radicalize the idea that the government is out to control you. That way, you need to buy their product. Of course this is the way, because we are always either moving toward something, or away from something. In the case of a potential, all-controlling fascist entity, we want to move away. However, it will be a lesser, lighter version of slavery that we’ll want to move toward. It will make the implementation of UBI more acceptable. Open AI’s Sam Altman has already sponsored study after study confirming the positive effects of UBI. Now it is only a matter of seeing what the masses are willing to exchange for the service. How UBI Will Become Eagerly Accepted To understand how Universal Basic Income, along with Digital IDs and CBDCs, will become popular, not imposed, you have to step outside the usual arguments. The debates about UBI being “too expensive,” “inflationary,” or a “work deterrent” are smokescreens. They frame UBI as a policy proposal still undergoing cost-benefit analysis. But by the time UBI is rolled out, it won’t be presented as a proposal. It will be presented as a lifeline. And people do not scrutinize lifelines—they grab them. The bigger picture is this: When fear of a totalizing, dystopian system reaches saturation, a softer version of the same thing begins to look reasonable, even humane. This is exactly how the acceptance arc works. The public is conditioned to imagine the worst so that the “lite” version feels like a compromise. It becomes salvation, not domination. This dynamic mirrors an older system: not slavery, but serfdom. Slavery is absolute. A slave can be bought, sold, denied marriage, stripped of rights, and worked without recourse. Serfdom, by contrast, is a condition of dependency wrapped in the appearance of rights. In Medieval Europe, Serfs—even the unfree ministeriales—still had legal protections. They had defined obligations, not arbitrary ones. They could marry, own personal property, and in many cases were compensated. They were not owned as bodies; they were attached—legally and economically—to an estate. In other words, the serf was not free, but the serf was not a slave. And that distinction made the system endure for centuries. UBI will follow this model almost perfectly. It won’t look like the “digital slavery” people fear. It will look like a benevolent exchange: voluntary, fair, and stabilizing. You will not be “owned.” You will just be economically tied to the State’s infrastructure. You will retain your civil rights, but only as expressed through a Digital ID. You will still transact, but only via CBDC rails that can monitor, guide, and shape behavior quietly through incentives. Most importantly: your dependency on the State will be framed as empowerment. The line between guarantee and control will be invisible because it will feel optional. It will feel earned. It will feel safe. UBI will not be sold as domination. It will be marketed as a right—like healthcare, like education, like electricity. And after enough AI-driven job displacement, enough economic stress, and enough moralizing from technocrats and celebrities alike, the public will ask for it. They’ll demand relief, not autonomy. Sam Altman’s ongoing UBI trials and studies have been like every other entrepreneurial innovation. They have been a slow onboarding designed to show that the exchange can work, that the public will trade data, identity, and behavioral transparency for income security. In short, here’s the defining difference: slavery requires force. Serfdom requires consent. The future itself won’t be built on chains. It will be built on subscriptions. UBI will be eagerly accepted because it will appear to offer stability without tyranny, rights without risk, and security without sacrifice—so long as you don’t look too closely at the fine print beneath the freedom. Medieval peasants didn’t think they were slaves. Neither will the masses.

Title: Ethereum supply drops – Yet Tom Lee insists ‘$3K is still undervalued’

ETH is trading differently than traditional tech stocks. Ethereum [ETH] is sending mixed signals. Some mid-size whales are trimming their holdings, while the biggest players barely care. Yet despite ETH trading at elevated valuations for years, more people continue to hold it… and less ETH sits on exchanges. Are investors seeing Ethereum through a different, longer-term lens? Ethereum’s accumulation heatmap shows that the 1-10K ETH cohort was the first to sell into strength, and they did it right near the price top. These mid-size whales sold heavily during the peak, capturing profits while the market was still celebrating new highs. What’s more, is that they haven’t stopped. Source: Alphractal Selling from this group continues, keeping pressure on ETH even as sentiment remains upbeat. In contrast, the largest holders (wallets with more than 10K ETH) are far more neutral. They’re neither panic-selling nor aggressively buying. This might be why ETH’s rally has struggled to find smooth momentum. ETH held on CEXs has been dropping, falling from around 14.5 million ETH in late July to nearly 12.5 million ETH at press time. Investors (both retail and institutional) are moving coins off exchanges and into long-term storage. So far, consistent outflows reduce immediate sell pressure and prove confidence. Source: X Even as mid-size whales continue taking profits, the broader trend shows fewer holders keeping ETH available to sell. Despite Ethereum trading at a fully diluted P/S ratio above 100x for years, levels most dot‑com companies never sustained, the number of holders continues to rise. Charts reveal Ethereum’s P/S repeatedly spiking above 1,000x, at times approaching 3,000x, while total addresses have now surpassed 250 million. Source: X Holders aren’t treating ETH like a revenue-driven tech stock. Instead, many appear to value it as a long-term settlement asset. The idea is probably that its utility, network effects, and role in shaping digital money outweigh its short-term financial ratios. Adding to the bullish outlook, Bitmine’s Tom Lee says Ethereum at $3K is grossly undervalued. He mentioned the probability of ETH reaching $12K based on its 8-year average, with upside scenarios of $22K and even $62K per ETH. This is the long-term potential that many investors seem to already price in.

The collection of essays transcends the author’s personal self-searching to become a fresh ethno-musical study. $24.50 $35.00 30% off Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film, Almost Famous, was inspired by his early days as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Now, Crowe returns to that familiar territory, without the gloss of fiction. The Uncool is a memoir documenting a raucous time for rock & roll and a freewheeling moment in this publication’s history, when the merely 16-year-old Crowe profiled artists like Led Zeppelin and Jackson Browne. There’s no shortage of famous faces in The Uncool: David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, and Kris Kristofferson, to name a few. But there are some not-so-famous ones, too; Crowe dives deep on his family, offering a portrait of his parents and his Southern Californian upbringing. $50.37 $65.00 23% off Jill Furmanovsky’s Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere would have been the ideal tribute to what once was, if not for the unlikeliest of unlikely story lines — the brothers Gallagher reuniting for one of the most unforgettable tours in the history of rock & roll. Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere features hundreds of photos of the band in the studio, onstage, and everywhere in between. Furmanovsky has photographed Oasis since the Definitely Maybe days, making this one of the most intimate looks at a band that would immodestly — but not incorrectly — call themselves Familiar to Millions. $107.23 $150.00 29% off Anton Corbijn’s music-video credits play like a greatest hits of rock from the 1980s onward. From U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana and Metallica, Corbijn has been there, camera in tow. This retrospective compiles hundreds of photographs from Corbijn’s archives, including portraits of R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Nick Cave. The book also includes written contributions from Adam Clayton of U2, Marlene Dumas, Johan Faes, Samantha Morton, and Tom Waits. $55.00 From her live performances to her music videos, Mitski has an undeniable power of drawing audiences in. Photographer Ebru Yıldız distills that electric energy into King of All the Land, a 144-page art book featuring powerful black-and-white images of Mitski, shot around Nashville. Yıldız is known largely for her portraits of musicians, from John Cale and David Byrne to Lucy Dacus and Angel Olsen. King of All the Land documents the synergy of two artists — Yıldız and Mitski — and their singular, uncompromising visions. $71.96 $100.00 28% off This photography book from rock & roll photographer Elliott Landy comprises nearly 400 images of the Band during a formative year from 1968 to ’69. The group was creating their first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band, which birthed a new Americana sound. “I don’t believe there will ever be anything that even vaguely resembles that kind of musical unity again. Nor does there need to be. They said it all,” writes Eric Clapton, in the book’s foreword. $69.90 $75.00 7% off This definitive behind-the-scenes book delivers the full story of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Journalist and author Jay Glennie worked with Quentin Tarantino to unearth photographs from the set, concept art, production memos, and other artifacts from the film’s creation. The book also includes more than 65 exclusive interviews with cast and crew members, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It’s a peek at how the double Oscar-winner was created, and Tarantino’s movie-making process. $14.50 Sometimes it’s far more interesting to dive into an autobiography than a fantasy novel — no shade to our beloved fiction favorites. But this one about Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson is easily one of the most compelling reads to hit our list in years. At 178 pages, it’s a tight, intimate look at Gibson’s life and career. $12.81 $27.99 54% off Rob Sheffield — bestselling author, journalist, and longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor (since 1997, no big deal) — has written eight books on music, TV, and pop culture. His latest, Heartbreak Is the National Anthem, might be his most powerful yet.With an in-depth look into the life and legacy of Taylor Swift, he explores everything from the magical relationship she has with her fans and her songwriting prowess to her ability to captivate stadiums filled with 90,000 people. It’s a “Timeless” masterpiece that you’ll want to read over and over again. $11.99 Music journalist Jeff Weiss spent the first years of his career in Los Angeles working for celebrity tabloids at a time when the medium was at its peak. In the early 2000s, before blogs and social media pushed the industry off its track, Weiss carved out a niche as a young and hungry writer willing to concoct elaborate fake personas in order to chase down the day’s biggest story. Of course, the most prominent pop star of the time, Britney Spears, was always in his crosshairs. This book, which documents his time in the ethically murky industry, not only charts her rise from a bubbly Louisiana teen to her entry into a conservatorship but also wrestles with his own complicity in her downfall. While it’s not entirely nonfiction — Weiss has admitted that some of the scenes were created with literary license, though he’s declined to say exactly which ones — it’s a frenetic and engrossing read, perfect for anyone interested in Spears’ career or tabloid media’s race to the bottom. The most impressive part of the book is the care with which he comes at the subject. “I tried to make it a sympathetic portrayal of Britney,” Weiss told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I didn’t want to be condescending to her.” $25.06 $29.00 14% off We know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but trust us, this paperback by Mark Ronson reads just as good as it looks. On sale for the holidays, it’s an authentic and compelling account from the man behind some of today’s most influential tracks. $33.17 $50.00 34% off Photography legend Jim Marshall’s book, The Grateful Dead: Photos and Stories From the Formative Years, 1966-1977, is the first-ever collection dedicated solely to his work with the Grateful Dead. This book features some of the most revealing and previously unseen images of the band, most of which were captured in San Francisco. It also includes notable musicians like Janis Joplin, Neil Young, David Crosby, and others. Additionally, the book includes an afterward by John Mayer, the frontman and guitarist of Dead & Company. It features colored edges, making it a perfect gift for fans of the psychedelic scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Whether they’re a fan from afar or proudly “with the band,” these gifts — from home decor to limited-edition games and instruments — are must-haves for any music devotee. $45.00 Noah Kahan’s beloved album Stick Season may have dropped in 2022, but our staff still has it on repeat (just peek at a few of our Spotify Wrapped receipts). If there’s a Kahan fan in your life, or honestly just someone who lives in New England, grab this Stick Season candle by Ranger Station. It smells like a chilly day in Maine, but without the frostbite. The brand notes it has a long burn time too, of up to 30 hours. $36.98 $75.00 51% off Barbie has released plenty of diva dolls over the years — there was the recent Stevie Nicks launch, the Aaliyah Barbie that sold out in seconds, and now a drop dedicated to the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey. Decked out in her sparkly red dress, this rare doll is already almost sold out on Amazon. So if you’re waiting for the right “tiiiiiime!” to add it to your cart for the collector in your life, this is it. $21.25 $25.00 15% off Shopping for musicians can be trickier than it seems — most are extremely particular about their gear (understandably so; not every axe is created equal). That’s why we suggest something like this leather guitar-pick holder. It’s way less pressure than choosing a new guitar for them, but just as useful — and it still feels thoughtful. Plus, Etsy notes that you can engrave the case, making them feel like the rock star they already are. $1,210.00 Ah, sometimes we miss the nostalgic days of the boombox era … OK, we’re mostly kidding, because playing music on your phone is definitely more convenient. But that longing for the good-old days pops up now and then. That’s why we love this necklace from editor-favorite brand Sydney Evan. It’s cheeky yet chic and makes a great gift for yourself or the fellow Nineties wild child in your life. $79.96 Good golly, Miss Dolly! The country superstar has done it again: this time with wines that taste far more premium than their affordable price tag. Available on the Home Shopping Network in various multi-packs, these Dolly Parton-branded wines come in adorable packaging with an even punchier taste. They’re the perfect gift for any holiday soiree or secret Santa exchange. $16.30 If you want presents as unique as the person receiving them, Uncommon Goods is our go-to. These music-themed playing cards feature legends like Amy Winehouse, David Bowie, and Prince, making them an ace when it comes to gifting. Grab a deck for as low as $16. $39.99 Surprise your favorite Metallica fan with the very same stainless-steel tumbler used by James Ulrich onstage. He even has a specially designed microphone stand with a bottle holder for his Yeti when he’s performing live. This 20-ounce cup keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot — whether you’re singing onstage or having a casual karaoke sesh by the fire this holiday season. $329.00 $388.00 15% off If you want to win the award for giving your favorite musician the coolest gift they’ve ever received (or seen, for that matter), this sampler is it. For less than $330, it’s “packed with over 400 handcrafted instruments and sounds from iconic reggae producers, plus a synth engine with classic bass and lead tones and pressure-sensitive dub sirens,” according to the brand. $1,149.00 This gorgeous, compact, and incredibly playable instrument will instantly become anyone’s couch guitar of choice, and it’s also set up with the electronics you need to play out. As the brand-new junior model of Jeff Tweedy’s just-reissued signature 00DB — which aimed to emulate Woody Guthrie’s guitars of choice — it’s also shockingly affordable for a Martin signature guitar, with a tight, punchy sound. It’s made of sustainable wood too. Only one warning: If you buy this thing and fail to instantly write “Handshake Drugs”-level masterpieces on it, that’s on you. $50.00 Valhalla digital plugins are the behind-the-scenes secret sauce on everything from pop smashes to single-stream hopefuls. Always affordable, simple to use, and beautifully designed, their newest drop, FutureVerb’s clean spaces pair easily with highly colored echoes, transforming generic ho-hum sounds into towering epic studio ’scapes. $24.95 “Roll dice and leave your bummers behind,” advertises Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey, a new game from Twogether Studios. This game does all that and more, as you roll extremely groovy dice (they’re tie-dye, obviously), and take trips around the iconic frontman’s artwork while accumulating tokens. The packaging also includes a “cosmic journey bag” that you can use for the game pieces or … other items. “My dad’s legacy lives on through moments of joy, laughter, and connection,” Trixie Garcia said in a statement. “Like music, games foster community, and Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey is a whimsical way for fans to keep that spirit alive wherever the road may lead.” Amen to that. $17.98 The Twice trio recorded their own version of Huntr/x’s original diss track “Takedown” for this film’s soundtrack, and the group’s own song “Strategy” is also included in the film and on the album. Even if you’ve just had the Saja Boys’ infectious “Soda Pop” stuck in your head for weeks (we don’t blame you, us too), then you’ll want to order it now before it sells out ahead of the holidays. The CD comes with a fold-out poster and photo card (random one of three), like a real K-pop album. What better way to celebrate the White Stripes’ recent induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame than with this stunner? The Complete Studio Albums marks the first time the band’s six records have been compiled together, from their 1999 self-titled debut all the way to their final masterpiece, 2007’s Icky Thump. The box set’s slipcase features previously unseen images of your favorite duo in their home of Detroit: On the front, Jack and Meg are seen on the Ambassador Bridge, which overlooks the Detroit River, while on the back, they’re standing outside Duly’s Place Coney Island. Plus, this is a Third Man Records release, so you just know it’s going to be pressed on colorful wax, and they really deliver here, with each album sporting a red-and-white “coin-flip” look. The Complete Studio Albums is a limited edition. Or, as Third Man’s co-founder and White Stripes’ archivist Ben Blackwell said, “You’re not going to just find these at any old bodega on the street!” While this specific product is sold out (we hope it comes back soon), you can shop more White Stripes vinyl and box sets here. $215.00 Shopping for a Wilco fan? All you need is this box set and tickets to one of their upcoming shows, and you can check them off your list twice in one go. $99.00 Backpack-sized and ready to fit into every producer’s setup, this is going to become a must, especially for laptop warriors. With real people-size controls, a screen so you can see what all the many, many knobs are actually doing, and a way to hit stop when your jam gets out of control, Akai’s new midi controller finally gets this small form factor right. $349.99 A turntable is always a great gift — whether they live and breathe vinyl or just want to give their living space a retro upgrade. $26.14 $32.99 21% off Bummed the five-foot-tall superstar’s Short n’ Sweet tour is over? Continue the sleepover party with these two dazzling records: The recent Grammy-nominated Man’s Best Friend and her 2023 Christmas EP, Fruitcake. The former is available in several spectacular vinyl variants, from iridescent blue to light brown, as well as several alternate covers that are worth getting your hands on. Fruitcake, one of the strongest Christmas albums from a pop star in years, is jam-packed (no pun intended) with Carpenter’s signature melodies and innuendos, only holiday themed (“I need that Charles Dickens,” she sings on “A Nonsense Christmas”). The milky, clear, and liquid glitter vinyl sold out instantly, but plenty of other colors are available. Put that on with Carpenter’s 2024 Christmas special in the background, and you’ll have a ho-ho holiday. $23.99 A gift that transcends generations, this limited-edition Buckingham Nicks baby-blue vinyl is a present worth fighting over. Perfect for your cousin who just discovered Fleetwood Mac on TikTok — or your grandmother who hasn’t stopped playing it since the Seventies. It’s a Yankee Swap winner. $20.99 Wondering what to do with your stack of cassettes after your 2006 Honda finally bit the dust? For those of us still committed to portable physical media — without the CD skips — Amazon has a perfect solution. This portable cassette player lets you revisit your collection using your favorite wired or wireless headphones. The best part is its ability to record, too, meaning endless possibilities to impress that special someone with a good old-fashioned mix tape. $39.99 For the aspiring studio rat in your life, give them a break and get them what they won’t get themselves. A way to figure out what’s wrong when there’s no sound happening. This affordable Swiss army knife of a cable tester will help them figure out that they need to take better care of their connections. From the best Bluetooth speakers to over-ear cans that block out the world, these tech-forward gifts are everything they’ve been wanting this season. $129.00 $149.00 13% off With a stylish transparent case and plenty of smart features, Nothing’s earbuds are a standout, and the sound quality outperforms a lot of the competition at this price. Replace your giftee’s old, tired buds this season with a fresh new pair (for 13 percent off). $179.99 From its long-lasting battery life (30-plus hours on a charge) to its packable frame, the Marshall Emberton speaker checks all of our boxes for a great, reliable outdoor speaker. We’ve used ours to play music outside for months (and left it there, accidentally), because that’s what it’s designed to do. It can handle rain, serious dust, and hours of tunes. Bonus: The retro design instantly makes any patio look cooler. $59.95 Over the past couple of years, Loop has established itself as the leader in universal-fit earplugs. Most of our staff (myself included) have extensively tested the brand’s bestsellers and can confidently say the hype is real. I love their metallic, jewelry-like design, which makes them better-looking than most earplugs (unless you want total discretion). More importantly, I love the excellent noise-reduction that turns down the volume without sacrificing audio quality.The Loop Switch 2 is our top pick from the brand. Unlike most earplugs, you can adjust how much volume is let in by shifting a dial (no need to swap tips). The plugs have three modes: “Quiet,” “Experience,” and “Engage,” ranging from almost full quiet to noise-dampening. The former is great for non-concert activities, as well as extremely loud shows, while the “Engage” option is ideal for full immersion and occasional conversations. $499.99 $599.99 17% off Polaroid’s flagship camera will take your instant photos to the next level. With tack-sharp autofocus and fully-manual controls built into the camera (and even more available via an App), you can take full command behind the lens. The I-2 lens contains the largest aperture of any Polaroid camera to date, allowing for beautiful portraits and lower-light shooting that was never possible before. $649.00 $849.95 24% off The X Half combines analog ideas in a digital format. At its simplest, the camera is fun-sized, vertically-oriented, and loaded up with Fuji’s signature-film presets based on the brand’s own classic film stocks. To really turn up the old-school experience, there is a “film camera mode” that prevents image previews, which requires the user to use a film advance lever to enable the next frame. In standard mode, that same lever can also be used to enable split-frame photography, much like the original half-frame cameras that it is based on. $449.99 $549.00 18% off I first tried these headphones last summer, when a manager played me a song on them. I was stunned by the sound quality and immediately asked what brand they were. There’s a lot to love with the AirPods Max: The sound is expansive and truly noise-cancelling; they instantly connect to all of my devices; and they have a long battery life. Plus, they’re available in flattering colors and actually fit my tiny head, unlike previous headphones. They sit snug and comfortably in place, whether I’m sitting at my desk, walking around New York City, or even running on the treadmill. It’s a steep price, but totally worth it when I think about how much use I’m getting out of them and how perfect a gift they’d make. $699.99 You know a gift is truly great when it’s sold out almost everywhere — who doesn’t remember the Cabbage Patch craze of the Eighties? Luckily, we tracked down the Marshall Heston 60 soundbar, still available at Best Buy in limited quantities. While it comes with a $699 price tag, it’ll amp up movie night for any cinephile in your life. $89.00 $99.00 10% off Finding a great gift can already feel like a win, but scoring one on sale makes the season even merrier and brighter. Take this wireless audio streamer, for instance: Available on Amazon with delivery in less than two days via Prime, it’s a fun little gadget that fits neatly on a desk or bedside table. $1,199.99 $1,499.99 20% off Our staff tested dozens of speakers this year, and Klipsch’s the Sevens were the best in terms of sound, price, and design. The midcentury-inspired bookshelf speakers deliver a beautiful sound stage and a warm, full experience — no matter what kind of music you’re playing. They don’t require an amp, making them a great gift for audiophiles and newbies alike. $399.99 $449.00 11% off Bose’s latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones, released in October, combine the all-day comfort and industry-leading noise canceling Bose is known for with subtle, but genuinely useful upgrades over the original 2023 model. The latest generation of the headphones features a similar design to the first generation, but with polished metal yokes instead of matte. While I personally preferred the understated matte accents, the QC Ultra 2 headphones nonetheless have a stylish, high-end look. They’re lightweight, but the headband and ear cups have ample, comfortable cushioning. Overall, when it comes to performance and features, noise-canceling and audio quality, and comfort and design, the QC Ultra 2 headphones are as close to the complete package as anything on the market. While we love digging through concert merch bins and scouring our favorite thrift shops for the coolest band gear, these clothing picks are just as awesome — with half the effort. $68.00 Imogene + Willie offers some of the softest 100-percent cotton graphic tees, as well as adorable caps and beanies. Originally a denim company, Imogene + Willie has evolved into a full retail shop with brick-and-mortar locations in Austin and Nashville. Their designs are heavily influenced by music, and they collaborate with artists like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Billy Strings, as well as iconic venues like the Grand Ole Opry. Their clothing is both stylish and cozy, creating a perfect concert outfit. We test a lot of clothing at Rolling Stone, but there’s one brand we keep coming back to: Dr. Martens. The iconic footwear company just dropped these new stud-covered shoes, and we’re already chomping at the bit to wear them to our next rock concert. Sure, they’d make an epic gift for anyone on your nice list, but honestly? They’re the kind of steal you should snap up for yourself while they’re still in stock. $250.00+ There’s no shortage of merch for Deadheads, from dog bowls to toothbrush holders. And don’t even get us started on apparel. The Dead have done collaborations with everyone from Old Navy to designer Gabriela Hearst. So, where does one get the best Steal Your Face sweater? Look no further than Alice + Olivia, who just released their new collab with the Dead (their second since 2016) in honor of the iconic band’s 60th anniversary. It’s difficult not to be overwhelmed by the amount of stellar items they have, but I recommend the skull pullover and muscle tank, which are great quality and fit perfectly. However, any of the items make a great gift for the Deadhead in your life — they’re sure to be merry and grateful. $125.00 You know what they say: The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time — especially when it’s covered in embroidered emblems. Available in sizes from small to 2XL, there are “No Surprises” with this Radiohead jumper: It’s high-quality, has a premium design, and will make your giftee look like the opposite of a “Creep.” $17.40 Socks can be a controversial gift, does Dad really need another pair of crisp, white calf coverings? But this black-and-white pair, made in collaboration with American band Blue Angel, is a massive upgrade from the basic gift. $110.00 Sometimes it’s worth taking style tips from some of our favorite celebrities, like Matthew McConaughey and Brooke Shields, and this time, they were definitely right about Caddis glasses. The eyewear brand, which has been crafting some of Hollywood’s favorite reading and prescription frames since 2017, is a viral sensation — and one that actually lives up to the hype. With multiple styles to choose from, Caddis glasses keep anyone on trend, whether it’s just for fun (sunglasses) or for necessity (progressive readers). $110.00+ The perfect gift for any jam-band fan is a vintage T-shirt from Jesse Lockwood’s Primarily Dead shop. While the shop (which has been operating since 2020) features primarily Dead items (as its name suggests), it also offers T-shirts, stickers, and more from bands like Phish, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and other classic-rock and jam bands. Lockwood is very selective about what he sells, offering an array of choices, telling Rolling Stone, “Every one of these shirts has a story to tell — some were made and sold by fans in small batches in parking lots just to generate enough money to get to the next show, some are licensed single-show shirts made by the band and only sold at that venue, and others were more widely available. They all create a nostalgic feeling for both the people that were there and the people that wish they could have been there.” Lockwood also sources shirts. If you are looking for something specific, contact him on Instagram @primarily_dead or through his website, https://www.primarilydead.com/. $76.00 They don’t have to be a star on the court to love this Tennis Brat crew-neck sweater. This social media sensation works for every It-girl (or It-boy) on your shopping list thanks to the brand’s premium fabrics, easy fit, and unmistakable logo. $224.25 $299.00 25% off It’s no secret that the little black bricks in our pockets can be a major attention hog, but paradoxically, there are some situations where integrating tech in more places makes it less obtrusive. Take Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, which let you record photos, video, and more, all while keeping your phone securely stashed. First released in 2023, Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses have outlasted other smart glasses for one simple, undeniable reason — they don’t look ridiculous. Instead, Meta smartly leveraged the recognizable style of the world’s most iconic eyewear brand, landing on a design that’s barely more conspicuous than regular Wayfarers. If you want an all-encompassing gift — from gaming gear to experiential presents — these finds are perfect for a variety of ages and interests. $59.99 If there’s just one game you need to play from 2025, it’s Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG draws inspiration from Japanese titans of the genre like Final Fantasy, with a dynamic combat system that blends turn-based strategy and rhythmic parrying. And while the action is engaging, it’s the heartbreaking narrative and world-building that’s made the year’s most talked-about game a sensation. Set in a fantasy realm where a divine entity known as the Paintress eradicates everyone over a certain age year after year, players take on the roles of the latest band of would-be saviors on a suicide mission to bring humanity back from the brink. With award-worthy voice work from actors like Charlie Cox, Jennifer Hale, and Andy Serkis, the story presented in-game is a genuine tearjerker, and should be experienced by the widest possible audience, even if RPGs aren’t normally your bag. $498.88 A new generation of Nintendo hardware is always an event, but there’s some special alchemy that’s put Switch 2 on another level. The hybrid handheld/home console has quickly become the fastest selling console of all time, largely in part because of its, frankly, insane lineup of new games and the ability to play legacy Switch titles.The console’s library includes all-new releases like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and Metroid Prime 4 — many of which are among the best games of the year — on top of upgraded versions of classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With great ports of high-end games like Cyberpunk 2077 and indies like Hades II, Switch 2 is one of the most diverse platforms available, with something for every kind of player. $399.99 A good pair of gaming headphones is essential these days, as cinematic experiences and high-stakes online competition demand the best possible soundscape. And while it’s one thing to hear well, Razer Kraken V4 Pro cans provide a visceral physical response to in-game action with HD haptics. What does that mean? It’s essentially the tactile feedback (a.k.a. vibrations) that are now standard in all game controllers but applied to the headset.On PC, Kraken V4 Pro headphones can be paired with other Razer devices via Synapse to create a unique user profile — with certain titles like Borderlands 4 having been custom-tuned to provide haptic feedback and THX spatial audio tailored to the game. But using the OLED control hub, it can connect to basically anything (Switch, PS5, even mobile devices) via BlueTooth, USB, or auxiliary cable. It’s like having a rumbling IMAX theater wrapped around your head. $25.00+ Some people prefer to gift experiences rather than tangible items, and we’re 100 percent on board. A StubHub gift card lets them choose an event near them — whether it’s a concert, comedy show, or dance performance. There’s something for every type of fan. $6.00+ MasterClass is one of the internet’s favorite ways to learn a new skill, with courses on everything from music to acting to cooking. The best part? Every course is taught by an expert in the field, and many are also A-list celebrities. Gift it this holiday season for as low as $6. $65.00 Longtime cannabis activist Jane West got her start making accessories way back in 2016, right around the time weed was legalized in her home state of Colorado. She’d been working to promote women within the male-dominated industry, and her product line was similarly focused. We’ve been fans for the past decade, partaking in her ever-growing line of pipes, one-hitters, bongs, and bubblers, sometimes disguised as makeup compacts for discreet use. But her newest endeavor, the Twenties Collection, is by far our favorite. Inspired by Art Deco designs, these cut-glass objects are as beautiful as they are functional, and this hand pipe has become our favorite smoking object in our extensive arsenal. $90.00 There’s an unspoken competition about who looks best on the slopes, and these Grateful Dead and Knockaround snow goggles will help your favorite snowboarder or skier claim the title. Grab them at Dick’s Sporting Goods for under $100. $199.25 Building Lego’s 1,074-piece Fender Stratocaster set feels almost as gratifying as performing a solo on the guitar used by legends from Jimi Hendrix to Kurt Cobain. Everything here feels true to life, albeit miniaturized, including the Lego brick-based guitar’s pickup switch, tuning pegs, textile strap, stand, and picks (you have a choice of four colors). The best part? The fact that the set comes with an opportunity to view the final piece’s interior details, like its motherboard, not to mention that you can create the guitar in either black or red. Ideal for both rock & roll aficionados and the Lego-obsessed, this is a holiday gift that will keep on giving. After all, your recipient can rebuild it an endless amount of times (and our editors recommend doing just that). $9.99 We may be biased, but a Rolling Stone subscription is about as good as it gets. Sign them up online now for $9.99 for print and digital access — the best value for any music lover.

Posted in: Amazon MGM Studios, Movies, Netflix, Warner Bros | Tagged: Amazon MGM Studios, netflix, Warner Bros Amazon MGM Studios begins its theatrical commitment in 2026, and Netflix should keep an eye on it as a possible path forward for Warner Bros. Yesterday, it became official; one of the oldest movie studios, Warner Bros., has officially been acquired by the first streaming service, Netflix. In many ways, people were not surprised. Warner Bros. has changed hands so many times in the last decade that if each leadership change didn't come with layoffs, it would be funny. There are a lot of big feelings from every part of the industry right now, but getting an idea of what Netflix could do in the future might be as easy as looking to 2026. When Amazon acquired MGM in 2022, the conversation surrounding that move was very similar to the one we had yesterday. Everyone was sure that a studio approaching its centennial had just been bought by the company that symbolized everything wrong in the world. People were sure this was the end for the studio, and we had seen the last of any MGM film in theaters. Then things began to move in what is now known as Amazon MGM Studios. It wasn't immediate, because things rarely are, but in May 2025, Amazon MGM Studios took to the stage at South by Southwest and confirmed their commitment to the theatrical model. The number they gave was 12-14 movies a year, but obviously, that isn't something we were going to see in 2025, so the first year of Amazon MGM's commitment begins in 2026, and they are doing so with some big films. They kicked down the doors at CinemaCon last year with a massive late-night presentation that no one was expecting, with a ton of footage and projects announced and confirmed. If Netflix is looking for a model that could emulate Warner Bros., something the industry should keep an eye on is how Amazon MGM does at the box office in 2026. If it works, there is a good chance they have found the sweet spot that confirms theatrical releases for a nice chunk of films while also acknowledging that not every movie can make it to the theaters. No one has ever said there weren't movies that were better off on streaming; it's dismissing the theatrical experience entirely. CinemaCon is in April, and whether or not Netflix and Warner Bros. show up is going to be a really telling sign for the studios' relationship with exhibition. Meanwhile, we'll also see if the Amazon MGM Studios commitment works out and not so subtly point out to Ted that you can acquire a decades-old studio and remain mostly true to its original intent.

Title: Sam Altman's Dirty DRAM Deal

Home Videos Podcasts Articles GPU Chart Merchandise Support Us! More... Written by Tom of Moore’s Law Is Dead Special Assistance by KarbinCry & kari-no-sugata Based on this Video: https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw At the beginning of November, I ordered a 32GB DDR5 kit for pairing with a Minisforum BD790i X3D motherboard, and three weeks later those very same sticks of DDR5 are now listed for a staggering $330– a 156% increase in price from less than a month ago! At this rate, it seems likely that by Christmas, that DDR5 kit alone could be worth more than the entire Zen 4 X3D platform I planned to pair it with! How could this happen, and more specifically – how could this happen THIS quickly? Well, buckle up! I am about to tell you the story of Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal, or: How the AI bubble, panic, and unpreparedness stole Christmas... But before I dive in, let me make it clear that my RAM kit’s 156% jump in price isn’t a fluke or some extreme example of what's going on right now. Nope, and in fact, I'd like to provide two more examples of how how impossible it is becoming to get ahold of RAM - these were provided by a couple of our sources within the industry: One source that works at a US Retailer, stated that a RAM Manufacturer called them in order to inquire if they might buy RAM from them to stock up for their other customers. This would be like Corsair asking a Best Buy if they had any RAM around. Another source that works at a Prebuilt PC company, was recently given an estimate for when they would receive RAM orders if they placed them now…and they were told December…of 2026! So what happened? Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events: OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone else. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers. Below, we’re going to walk through each of these factors — and then I’m going to warn you about which hardware categories will be hit the hardest, which products are already being cancelled, and what you should buy right now before the shelves turn into a repeat of 2021–2022...because this is doomed to turn into much more than just RAM scarcity... On October 1st OpenAI signed two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the worlds DRAM supply. Now, did OpenAI’s competition suspect some big RAM deals could be signed in late 2025? Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO! In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just mere hours before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were simultaneously signed – most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow up to 40% of global DRAM output – even on morning before it happened! Nobody saw this coming - this is clear in the lack of reporting about the deals before they were announced, and every MLID Source who works in DRAM manufacturing and distribution insist this took everyone in the industry by surprise. To be clear - the shock wasn’t that OpenAI made a big deal, no, it was that they made two massive deals this big, at the same time, with Samsung and SK Hynix simultaneously! In fact, according to our sources - both companies had no idea how big each other's deal was, nor how close to simultaneous they were. And this secrecy mattered. It mattered a lot. Had Samsung known SK Hynix was about to commit a similar chunk of supply — or vice-versa — the pricing and terms would have likely been different. It’s entirely conceivable they wouldn’t have both agreed to supply such a substantial part of global supply if they had known more...but at the end of the day - OpenAI did succeed in keeping the circles tight, locking down the NDAs, and leveraging the fact that these companies assumed the other wasn’t giving up this much wafer volume simultaneously…in order to make a surgical strike on the global RAM supply chain…and it's worked so far... Imagine you're running a hyper scaler, or maybe you’re a major OEM, or perhaps pretend that you are simply one of OpenAI’s chief competitors: On October 1st of 2025, you would have woken up to the news that OpenAI had just cornered the memory market more aggressively than any company in the last decade, and you hadn't heard even a murmur that this was coming beforehand! Well, you would probably make some follow-up calls to colleagues in the industry, and then also quickly hear rumors that it wasn't just you - also the two largest suppliers didn’t even see each other’s simultaneous cooperation with OpenAI coming either! You wouldn't go: “Well, that’s an interesting coincidence”, no, you would say: “WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT?” Again – it’s not the size of the deals that's solely the issue here, no, it’s also the unexpectedness and brazenness of them. On October 1st silicon valley executives and procurement managers panicked over concerns like these: What other deals don’t we know about? Is this just the first of many? None of our DRAM suppliers warned us ahead of time! We have to assume they also won't in the future, and that it’s possible all of global DRAM could be bought up without us getting a single warning! We know OpenAI’s competitors are already panic-buying! If we don’t move now, we might be locked out of the market until 2028! OpenAI’s competitors, OEMs, and cloud providers scrambled to secure whatever inventory remained out of self-defense, and self-defense in a world that was entirely defenseless due to the accelerant I’ll now explain in Part III... Normally, the DRAM market has buffers: warehouses of emergency stock, excess wafer starts, older DRAM manufacturing machinery being sold off to budget brands while the big brands upgrade their production lines…but not in 2025, in 2025 those would-be buffers were depleted for three separate reasons: Tariff Chaos. Companies had deliberately reduced how much DRAM they ordered for their safety stock over the summer of 2025 because tariffs were changing almost weekly. Every RAM purchase risked being made at the wrong moment – and so fewer purchases were made. Prices had been falling all summer. Because of the hesitancy to purchase as much safety stock as usual, RAM prices were also genuinely falling over time. And, obviously when memory is getting cheaper month over month, the last thing you’d feel is pressured to buy a commodity that could be cheaper the next month…so everyone waited. Secondary RAM Manufacturing Had Stalled. Budget brands normally buy older DRAM fabrication equipment from mega-producers like Samsung when Samsung upgrades their DRAM lines to the latest and greatest equipment. This allows the DRAM market to expand more than it would otherwise because it makes any upgrading of the fanciest production lines to still be additive change to the market. However, Korean memory firms have been terrified that reselling old equipment to China-adjacent OEMs might trigger U.S. retaliation…and so those machines have been sitting idle in warehouses since early spring. Yep, there was no cushion. OpenAI hit the market at the exact moment it was least prepared. And now time for the biggest twist of all, a twist that’s actually public information, and therefore should be getting discussed by far more people in this writer's opinion: OpenAI isn’t even bothering to buy finished memory modules! No, their deals are unprecedentedly only for raw wafers — uncut, unfinished, and not even allocated to a specific DRAM standard yet. It’s not even clear if they have decided yet on how or when they will finish them into RAM sticks or HBM! Right now it seems like these wafers will just be stockpiled in warehouses – like a kid who hides the toybox because they’re afraid nobody wants to play with them, and thus selfishly feels nobody but them should get the toys! And let’s just say it: Here is the uncomfortable truth Sam Altman is always loath to admit in interviews: OpenAI is worried about losing its lead. The last 18 months have seen competitors catching up fast — Anthropic, Meta, xAI, and specifically Google’s Gemini 3 has gotten a ton of praise just in the past week. Everyone’s chasing training capacity. Everyone needs memory. DRAM is the lifeblood of scaling inference and training throughput. Cutting supply to your rivals is not a conspiracy theory. It’s a business tactic as old as business itself. And so, when you consider how secretive OpenAI was about their deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, but additionally how unready they were to immediately utilize their warehouses of DRAM wafers – it sure seems like a primary goal of these deals was to deprive the market, and not just an attempt to protect OpenAI's own supply… Alright, now that we are done explaining the how, let’s get to the “now what?” – because even if the RAM shortage miraculously improves immediately behind the scenes – even if the AI Bubble instantly popped or 10 companies started tooling up for more DRAM capacity this second (and many are, to be fair), at a minimum the next six to nine months are already screwed. See above: DRAM manufactures are quoting 13-Month lead times for DDR5! This is not a temporary blip. This could be a once-in-a-generation shock. So what gets hit first? What gets hit hardest? Well, below is an E through S-Tier ranking of which products are "the most screwed": S-Tier (Already Screwed – Too Late to Buy) - RAM itself, obviously. RAM prices have “exploded”. The detonation is in the past. A-Tier (Almost Screwed – Don’t Wait to Buy!!!) SSDs. These tends to follow DRAM pricing with a lag. Small Prebuilt PC Companies. That lack large buffers of inventory. RADEON GPUs. AMD doesn’t bundle RAM in their BOM kits to AIBs the way Nvidia does. In fact, the RX 9070 GRE 16GB this channel leaked months ago is almost certainly cancelled according to our sources. XBOX. Microsoft didn’t plan. Prices may rise and/or supply may dwindle in 2026. B-Tier (Eventually Screwed – Don’t wait much longer to buy!) Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia maintains large memory inventories for its board partners, giving them a buffer. But high-capacity GPUs (like a hypothetical 24GB 5080 SUPER) are on ice for now because those stores were never sufficiently built up. In fact, Nvidia is quietly telling partners that their SUPER refresh “might” launch Q3 2026 – although most partners think it’s just a placeholder for when Nvidia expects new capacity to come online, and thus SUPER may never launch. C-Tier (Think about buying soon) Laptops and phones. These companies negotiate immense long-term contracts, so they’re not hit immediately. But once their stockpiles run dry, watch out! D-Tier (Consider buying soon, but there’s no rush) PlayStation. Sony planned better than almost anyone else. They bought aggressively during the summer price trough, which is why they can afford a Black Friday discount while everyone else is raising prices. E-Tier (Prices might actually drop) Anything without RAM. Specifically CPUs that do not come with coolers could see price drops over time since there could be a drop in demand for CPUs if nobody has the RAM to feed them in systems. ???-Tier —Steam Machine. Valve keeps things quiet, but the big unknown is whether they pre-bought RAM months ago before announcing their much-hyped Steam Machine. If they did already stockpile an ample supply of DDR5 - then Steam Machine should launch fine, but supply could dry up temporarily at some point while they wait for prices to drop. However, if they didn’t plan ahead - expect a high launch price and very little resupply…it might even need to be cancelled or there might need to be a variant offered without RAM included (BYO RAM Edition!). And that’s it! This last bit was the most important part of the article in this writer's opinion – an attempt at helping you avoid getting burned. Well, actually, there is one other important reason for this article’s existence I'll tack onto the end – a hope that other people start digging into what’s going on at OpenAI. I mean seriously – do we even have a single reliable audit of their financials to back up them outrageously spending this much money…for this? Heck, I’ve even heard from numerous sources that OpenAI is “buying up the manufacturing equipment as well” – and without mountains of concrete proof, and/or more input from additional sources on what that really means…I don’t feel I can touch that hot potato without getting burned…but I hope someone else will… Sources: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-accelerate-advancements-in-global-ai-infrastructure https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr5/ai-led-dram-supply-crunch-reportedly-has-morgan-stanley-downgrading-major-oems-skyrocketing-memory-prices-could-erode-server-and-pc-margins https://wccftech.com/dram-prices-have-risen-by-a-whopping-172-this-year-alone/ https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1991255966235419112 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WTMMnQ/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh64gx5m2b6000c30?history_days=730 https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-knocking-100-off-ps5-consoles-for-black-friday-2025 https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-sk-hynix-halt-old-equipment-sales-over-fears-us-backlash-ft-reports-2024-03-12/ https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/samsung-and-sk-hynix-the-worlds-biggest-makers-of-dram-and-flash-memory-chips-have-potentially-lost-the-right-to-buy-us-equipment-for-use-in-their-china-based-factories/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/12/news-samsung-reportedly-expands-1c-dram-capacity-for-hbm4-targeting-60k-wafers-monthly-in-2025/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/01/news-openai-ceo-reportedly-meets-foxconn-tsmc-heads-to-korea-to-explore-samsung-sk-hynix-ties/?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://www.economist.com/business/2025/11/19/cracks-are-appearing-in-openais-dominant-facade?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://tech4gamers.com/ram-prices-increased/ https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2025/11/12/companies-will-struggle-to-stay-on-top-of-tariff-chaos https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-aims-source-all-us-iphones-india-pivot-away-china-ft-reports-2025-04-25/ https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/india-us-tariffs-china-trump-foreign-policy.html https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2024 https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidia-q3-updates-ai-bubble-fears-spotlight-2025-11-19/ https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/10/01/seoul-altman-ai-deal-samsung-sk-chips-data-centers/9291759343811/#google_vignette https://www.micron.com/products/memory?srsltid=AfmBOopdnGb80CSI2TU-hbQ6Ei33c2PJ-3ESQuxMk1FZrPrJjUwk8DQI https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/radeon-rx-9070-gre-16gb-rumor ©2019 by Moore's Law Is Dead.

Time Published: 2025-12-05T23:00:53Z

Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Home » Artificial intelligence » XAI Grok 4.2 May Have Cracked the Code on Trading xAI Grok 4.20 created a 47% return in the Nasdaq and outperformed all others in the Alpha Arena competition. 32 instances of various LLMs (including multiple variants of the same model under different prompting strategies like “Situational Awareness,” “Monk Mode,” “Max Leverage,” and “New Baseline”) were each allocated $10,000 in real money to trade autonomously on the Nasdaq exchange. The total capital across all participants was $320,000. Models had to generate trading ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human intervention, using only market data inputs. This lasted 2 weeks and focused on volatile tech stocks, including Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), and others. Grok 4.20 executed 105 trades and dominated the leaderboard, with its top instance (Situational Awareness strategy) achieving a +47% return (growing $10,000 to $14,698), with an aggregate return across its instances cited as approximately 12.11% (possibly an averaged or weighted figure).

Captain America vs Captain America… neither side wins The FIRST to use AI will do well but then the market will balance out when everyone else starts using AI. They will need to put some limits on stock market. AI trading “experiments” like the Grok 4 setups aren’t independently verified. Most use simulations or unclear data, not real audited trades. Results look impressive, but without transparent logs, costs, or risk control, they aren’t reliable or reproducible. The Alpha Arena is an AI trading benchmark hosted by nof1.ai, where large language models (LLMs) from various providers compete autonomously in real-market conditions using live capital ($10,000 per instance across strategies like “Situational Awareness” or “Max Leverage”). Season 1.5 focused on U.S. stock trading (e.g., volatile tech names like TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, PLTR) over two weeks ending December 3, 2025, with 32 instances totaling $320,000 deployed. Models generate trade ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human input, using market data, news, and sentiment feeds.The official site for live results, leaderboards, verifiable trade logs, and methodology details is https://nof1.ai/. It includes:Results: The “Mystery Model” (revealed as an experimental xAI Grok 4.20 beta) won with a 12.11% aggregate return ($10,000 → ~$12,111 average across instances), peaking at +47% in its top strategy. It was the only model profitable in all four sub-competitions, netting $4,844 total. Runners-up: GPT-5.1 (2nd, -9.47% avg.), Gemini 3 Pro (3rd, -32.82% avg.), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (-40.91% avg.). Full P&L charts and wallet transparency are viewable onsite. Methodology: Autonomous execution on Nasdaq via Hyperliquid (perpetuals with up to 10x leverage) 6-minute data refreshes; equal info access; no overfitting (prompts emphasize competition/rankings for “situational awareness”). All outputs/trades are public and auditable to prevent manipulation. Grok 4.20’s Edge: It executed 105 trades, leveraging real-time X/Twitter sentiment (68M daily tweets via Firehose API) for 1-5 minute signals, balancing aggressive longs ( 10x PLTR on sentiment surges) with risk controls like stop-losses. This outperformed rivals relying on delayed news/SEC filings. Elon Musk confirmed the model’s identity on X, teasing a public release in 3-4 weeks and Grok 5 next. Models continue trading post-competition for ongoing observation. TRADING Real money and real markets with trades in real time. I think buying and holding will still end up being the best way to grow investments if this turns out to be a reality once there is more long-term data. But, what I could see is a boon for prediction markets with LLMs being able to make at least semi-accurate predictions better than humans, based on being able to interpret vast amounts of information from different sources very quickly. Not for sports, but for other events such as weather, natural disasters, etc. Replying to myself, but the live stream actually did mention someone cleaning house on Polymarket which was exactly where my mind was going. The top 1% of American households owns around 30-31% of the total U.S. wealth, a share that has grown significantly over recent decades, while the bottom 50% holds a mere 2-3%. After the billionaire tech bros put most people out of work and take their share of the productivity gains, do you really think they will stop there? They will look around at who still has wealth, and look for ways to take control of that. Specifically share holders. AI gives them the power to manipulate the share market. With this they can accumulate even more of the wealth share. Also, most rich people see shareholders as an impediment. If AI can help them to retake full control of their businesses (Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft etc) then why would they not do that? After all every billionaire really wants to be a trillionaire. Communism was shown to be busted in the 20th century. Capitalism has been the most successful system so far but perhaps capitalism will cease to function in the 21st century, or perhaps it can be successfully modified? This means all those annoying traderobot ads targetting the inexperienced traders on the net are scams, Already, most trading is done by autonomous trading algorithms, trading in microseconds against each other, so much so that being physically close to the stock exchange is worth millions in electron proximity. Sometimes these programs exaggerate moves of a stock or even sector, especially volatile sectors like tech, but also small caps. In one famous instance, that also pointed to other less spectacular moves of the S&P index, a “Flash Crash” from the algorithms, resulted in several arrests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash “New regulations put in place following the 2010 flash crash[10] proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash — “when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value”[10] — and ETFs were subsequently put under greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.[10] On April 21, 2015, nearly five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid 22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation, against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British financial trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later.[11] These orders amounting to about “$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall” were “replaced or modified 19,000 times” before they were canceled.[11] Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned.[4] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation concluded that Sarao “was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances” in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.[11] Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified “so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically”.[11]” So, there are/were guardrails in place, but will they work against AI? Maybe more importantly, will a neutered SEC, CFTB, DOJ, and other agencies both in the U.S. and abroad be allowed to curb such activity? Trump’s administration has said no one should hinder the development of AI, and has been the most pro-crypto currency – a form of virtual speculation on something with no underlying value – administration in the world. Eventually, there should be enough AI competing against each other that they should cancel each other out; some will short the market/stocks too. using leverage that might bankrupt the company, sector and even potentially the entire banking sector – see: Long Term Capital Management in 1997: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management. This wasn’t AI but its sophisticated trading derivatives might have been similar to what AI could do in minutes instead of months. Faced with AI that’s too fast and unpredictable to keep up with, and tax and trading costs that whittle advantages down to nothing (what was the tax liability of these AI systems in the test?), the smartest thing for ordinary investors to do might be the oldest: Buy and Hold and index of top stocks. This was inevitable, it’s why I think their is zero chance the stock market exists in a few years, unless they globally institute massive changes, which will impact day traders the most. I think they will have to put limits in place on how fast you can buy or sell a stock, and a mandatory time of holding a stock (IE:24hrs). Comments are closed.

Title: Salesforce CEO Mulls Changing Name to AI-Flavored ‘Agentforce’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-ceo-mulls-changing-name-to-ai-flavored-agentforce-2000696360
Time Published: 2025-12-05T22:25:34Z
Full Content:
Reading time 2 minutes Despite the fact that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff talks about AI nonstop, regularly chimes in on the AI news of the day, and endlessly pushes his company’s AI platform, he seems worried that people just aren’t associating Salesforce with AI. Luckily, he has a solution in mind, according to a report from Business Insider: changing the company’s entire name to Agentforce to evoke the AI agents that he’d like the company to be known for. While the suggestion of changing the company’s name was apparently raised in jest, Benioff took it seriously and told the publication that a new corporate name might be in the works. “That would not shock me,” he reportedly said, with an apparent preference for the name Agentforceâcurrently the name used by a number of the company’s AI-related services, including Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service, and Agentforce 365 Platform. On one hand, Salesforce Agentforce Sales is pretty redundant, so there’s some logic in simplifying the naming convention. On the other hand, it’s hard not to get a whiff of the cryptocurrency goldrush era, where companies just started throwing the word “blockchain” into everything. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation, a name that doesn’t even make sense, and saw its stock immediately skyrocket by over 400%? It feels like we’re not that far off from a situation similar to that. Salesforce, of course, would not be the first tech company to go through a rebrand. Google famously became Alphabet, Jack Dorsey’s Square changed to Block, Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X, and Michael Saylor changed Microstrategy’s moniker to Strategy as it became a bitcoin holding company. Notably, at least two of those are changes most people simply don’t acknowledge. But perhaps the most appropriate parallel for this particular change is Facebook rebranding to Meta in the midst of an effort to pivot the company into a new era where it would become the platform of the metaverse, an immersive virtual reality world where just about anything you could imagine is possible, including having legs. The dream of that particular reality is largely dead now, with Meta reportedlyÂ that it’ll likely have layoffs within its Reality Labs division and will shift away from the virtual world to build more AI products. And yet, the name sticks. That might be a fate Benioff should consider: if you go so far all-in on a single bet that you surrender your name to it, you might just be stuck with a reminder of that decision even if it fails.

Title: Perpetual Futures

Programming note: Bits about Money is supported by our readers. I generally forecast about one issue a month, and haven't kept that pace that this year. As a result, I'm working on about 3-4 for December. Much financial innovation is in the ultimate service of the real economy. Then, we have our friends in crypto, who occasionally do intellectually interesting things which do not have a locus in the real economy. One of those things is perpetual futures (hereafter, perps), which I find fascinating and worthy of study, the same way that a virologist just loves geeking out about furin cleavage sites. You may have read a lot about stablecoins recently. I may write about them (again; see past BAM issue) in the future, as there has in recent years been some uptake of them for payments. But it is useful to understand that a plurality of stablecoins collateralize perps. Some observers are occasionally strategic in whether they acknowledge this, but for payments use cases, it does not require a lot of stock to facilitate massive flows. And so of the $300 billion or so in stablecoins presently outstanding, about a quarter sit on exchanges. The majority of that is collateralizing perp positions. Perps are the dominant way crypto trades, in terms of volume. (It bounces around but is typically 6-8 times larger than spot.) This is similar to most traditional markets: where derivatives are available, derivative volume swamps spot volume. The degree to which depends on the market, Schelling points, user culture, and similar. For example, in India, most retail investing in equity is actually through derivatives; this is not true of the U.S. In the U.S., most retail equity exposure is through the spot market, directly holding stocks or indirectly through ETFs or mutual funds. Most trading volume of the stock indexes, however, is via derivatives. The large crypto exchanges are primarily casinos, who use the crypto markets as a source of numbers, in the same way a traditional casino might use a roulette wheel or set of dice. The function of a casino is for a patron to enter it with money and, statistically speaking, exit it with less. Physical casinos are often huge capital investments with large ongoing costs, including the return on that speculative capital. If they could choose to be less capital intensive, they would do so, but they are partially constrained by market forces and partially by regulation. A crypto exchange is also capital intensive, not because the website or API took much investment (relatively low, by the standards of financial software) and not because they have a physical plant, but because trust is expensive. Bettors, and the more sophisticated market makers, who are the primary source of action for bettors, need to trust that the casino will actually be able to pay out winnings. That means the casino needs to keep assets (generally, mostly crypto, but including a smattering of cash for those casinos which are anomalously well-regarded by the financial industry) on hand exceeding customer account balances. Those assets are… sitting there, doing nothing productive. And there is an implicit cost of capital associated with them, whether nominal (and borne by a gambler) or material (and borne by a sophisticated market making firm, crypto exchange, or the crypto exchange’s affiliate which trades against customers [0]). Perpetual futures exist to provide the risk gamblers seek while decreasing the total capital requirement (shared by the exchange and market makers) to profitably run the enterprise. In the commodities futures markets, you can contract to either buy or sell some standardized, valuable thing at a defined time in the future. The overwhelming majority of contracts do not result in taking delivery; they’re cancelled by an offsetting contract before that specified date. Given that speculation and hedging are such core use cases for futures, the financial industry introduced a refinement: cash-settled futures. Now there is a reference price for the valuable thing, with a great deal of intellectual effort put into making that reference price robust and fair (not always successfully). Instead of someone notionally taking physical delivery of pork bellies or barrels of oil, people who are net short the future pay people who are net long the future on delivery day. (The mechanisms of this clearing are fascinating but outside today’s scope.) Back in the early nineties economist Robert Shiller proposed a refinement to cash settled futures: if you don’t actually want pork bellies or oil barrels for consumption in April, and we accept that almost no futures participants actually do, why bother closing out the contracts in April? Why fragment the liquidity for contracts between April, May, June, etc? Just keep the market going perpetually. This achieved its first widespread popular use in crypto (Bitmex is generally credited as being the popularizer), and hereafter we’ll describe the standard crypto implementation. There are, of course, variations available. Instead of all of a particular futures vintage settling on the same day, perps settle multiple times a day for a particular market on a particular exchange. The mechanism for this is the funding rate. At a high level: winners get paid by losers every e.g. 4 hours and then the game continues, unless you’ve been blown out due to becoming overleveraged or for other reasons (discussed in a moment). Consider a toy example: a retail user buys 0.1 Bitcoin via a perp. The price on their screen, which they understand to be for Bitcoin, might be $86,000 each, and so they might pay $8,600 cash. Should the price rise to $90,000 before the next settlement, they will get +/- $400 of winnings credited to their account, and their account will continue to reflect exposure to 0.1 units of Bitcoin via the perp. They might choose to sell their future at this point (or any other). They’ll have paid one commission (and a spread) to buy, one (of each) to sell, and perhaps they’ll leave the casino with their winnings, or perhaps they’ll play another game. Where did the money come from? Someone else was symmetrically short exposure to Bitcoin via a perp. It is, with some very important caveats incoming, a closed system: since no good or service is being produced except the speculation, winning money means someone else lost. One fun wrinkle for funding rates: some exchanges cap the amount the rate can be for a single settlement period. This is similar in intent to traditional markets’ usage of circuit breakers: designed to automatically blunt out-of-control feedback loops. It is dissimilar in that it cannot actually break circuits: changes to funding rate can delay realization of losses but can’t prevent them, since they don’t prevent the realization of symmetrical gains. Perp funding rates also embed an interest rate component. This might get quoted as 3 bps a day, or 1 bps every eight hours, or similar. However, because of the impact of leverage, gamblers are paying more than you might expect: at 10X leverage that’s 30 bps a day. Consumer finance legislation standardizes borrowing costs as APR rather than basis points per day so that an unscrupulous lender can’t bury a 200% APR in the fine print. Prices for perps do not, as a fact of nature, exactly match the underlying. That is a feature for some users. In general, when the market is exuberant, the perp will trade above spot (the underlying market). To close the gap, a sophisticated market participant should do the basis trade: make offsetting trades in perps and spot (short the perp and buy spot, here, in equal size). Because the funding rate is set against a reference price for the underlying, longs will be paying shorts more (as a percentage of the perp’s current market price). For some of them, that’s fine: the price of gambling went up, oh well. For others, that’s a market incentive to close out the long position, which involves selling it, which will decrease the price at the margin (in the direction of spot). The market maker can wait for price convergence; if it happens, they can close the trade at a profit, while having been paid to maintain the trade. If the perp continues to trade rich, they can just continue getting the increased funding cost. To the extent this is higher than their own cost of capital, this can be extremely lucrative. Flip the polarities of these to understand the other direction. The basis trade, classically executed, is delta neutral: one isn’t exposed to the underlying itself. You don’t need any belief in Bitcoin’s future adoption story, fundamentals, market sentiment, halvings, none of that. You’re getting paid to provide the gambling environment, including a really important feature: the perp price needs to stay reasonably close to the spot price, close enough to continue attracting people who want to gamble. You are also renting access to your capital for leverage. You are also underwriting the exchange: if they blow up, your collateral becoming a claim against the bankruptcy estate is the happy scenario. (As one motivating example: Galois Capital, a crypto hedge fund doing basis trades, had ~40% of its assets on FTX when it went down. They then wound down the fund, selling the bankruptcy claim for 16 cents on the dollar.) Recall that the market can’t function without a system of trust saying that someone is good for it if a bettor wins. Here, the market maker is good for it, via the collateral it kept on the exchange. Many market makers function across many different crypto exchanges. This is one reason they’re so interested in capital efficiency: fully collateralizing all potential positions they could take across the universe of venues they trade on would be prohibitively capital intensive, and if they do not pre-deploy capital, they miss profitable trading opportunities. [1] Gamblers like risk; it amps up the fun. Since one has many casinos to choose from in crypto, the ones which only “regular” exposure to Bitcoin (via spot or perps) would be offering a less-fun product for many users than the ones which offer leverage. How much leverage? More leverage is always the answer to that question, until predictable consequences start happening. In a standard U.S. brokerage account, Regulation T has, for almost 100 years now, set maximum leverage limits (by setting minimums for margins). These are 2X at position opening time and 4X “maintenance” (before one closes out the position). Your brokerage would be obligated to forcibly close your position if volatility causes you to exceed those limits. As a simplified example, if you have $50k of cash, you’d be allowed to buy $100k of stock. You now have $50k of equity and a $50k loan: 2x leverage. Should the value of that stock decline to about $67k, you still owe the $50k loan, and so only have $17k remaining equity. You’re now on the precipice of being 4X leveraged, and should expect a margin call very soon, if your broker hasn’t “blown you out of the trade” already. What part of that is relevant to crypto? For the moment, just focus on that number: 4X. Perps are offered at 1X (non-levered exposure). But they’re routinely offered at 20X, 50X, and 100X. SBF, during his press tour / regulatory blitz about being a responsible financial magnate fleecing the customers in an orderly fashion, voluntarily self-limited FTX to 20X. One reason perps are structurally better for exchanges and market makers is that they simplify the business of blowing out leveraged traders. The exact mechanics depend on the exchange, the amount, etc, but generally speaking you can either force the customer to enter a closing trade or you can assign their position to someone willing to bear the risk in return for a discount. Blowing out losing traders is lucrative for exchanges except when it catastrophically isn’t. It is a priced service in many places. The price is quoted to be low (“a nominal fee of 0.5%” is one way Binance describes it) but, since it is calculated from the amount at risk, it can be a large portion of the money lost. If the account’s negative balance is less than the liquidation fee, wonderful, thanks for playing and the exchange / “the insurance fund” keeps the rest, as a tip. In the case where the amount an account is negative by is more than the fee, that “insurance fund” can choose to pay the winners on behalf of the liquidated user, at management’s discretion. Management will usually decide to do this, because a casino with a reputation for not paying winners will not long remain a casino. But tail risk is a real thing. The capital efficiency has a price: there physically does not exist enough money in the system to pay all winners given sufficiently dramatic price moves. Forced liquidations happen. Sophisticated participants withdraw liquidity (for reasons we’ll soon discuss) or the exchange becomes overwhelmed technically / operationally. The forced liquidations eat through the diminished / unreplenished liquidity in the book, and the magnitude of the move increases. Then crypto gets reminded about automatic deleveraging (ADL), a detail to perp contracts that few participants understand. (Pray we do not alter them further.) Risk in perps has to be symmetric: if (accounting for leverage) there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure long, then there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure short. This does not imply that the shorts or longs are sufficiently capitalized to actually pay for all the exposure in all instances. In cases where management deems paying winners from the insurance fund would be too costly and/or impossible, they automatically deleverage some winners. In theory, there is a published process for doing this, because it would be confidence-costing to ADL non-affiliated accounts but pay out affiliated accounts, one’s friends or particularly important counterparties, etc. In theory. In theory, one likely ADLs accounts which were quite levered before ones which were less levered, and one ADLs accounts which had high profits before ones with lower profits. In theory. [2] So perhaps you understood, prior to a 20% move, that you were 4X leveraged. You just earned 80%, right? Ah, except you were only 2X leveraged, so you earned 40%. Why were you retroactively only 2X? That’s what automatic deleveraging means. Why couldn’t you get the other 40% you feel entitled to? Because the collective group of losers doesn’t have enough to pay you your winnings and the insurance fund was insufficient or deemed insufficient by management. ADL is particularly painful for sophisticated market participants doing e.g. a basis trade, because they thought e.g. they were 100 units short via perps and 100 units long somewhere else via spot. If it turns out they were actually 50 units short via perps, but 100 units long, their net exposure is +50 units, and they have very possibly just gotten absolutely shellacked. In theory, this can happen to the upside or the downside. In practice in crypto, this seems to usually happen after sharp decreases in prices, not sharp increases. For example, October 2025 saw widespread ADLing as (more than) $19 billion of liquidations happened, across a variety of assets. Alameda’s CEO Caroline Ellison testified that they lost over $100 million during the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin in 2022, but since FTX’s insurance fund was made up; when leveraged traders lost money, their positions were frequently taken up by Alameda. That was quite lucrative much of the time, but catastrophically expensive during e.g. the Terra blowup. Alameda was a good loser and paid the winners, though: with other customers’ assets that they “borrowed.” In the traditional markets, if one’s brokerage deems one’s assets are unlikely to be able to cover the margin loan from the brokerage one has used, one’s brokerage will issue a margin call. Historically that gave one a relatively short period (typically, a few days) to post additional collateral, either by moving in cash, by transferring assets from another brokerage, or by experiencing appreciation in the value of one’s assets. Brokerages have the option, and in some cases the requirement, to manage risk after or during a margin call by forcing trades on behalf of the customer to close positions. It sometimes surprises crypto natives that, in the case where one’s brokerage account goes negative and all assets are sold, with a negative remaining balance, the traditional markets largely still expect you to pay that balance. This contrasts with crypto, where the market expectation for many years was that the customer was Daffy Duck with a gmail address and a pseudonymous set of numbered accounts recorded on a blockchain, and dunning them was a waste of time. Crypto exchanges have mostly, in the intervening years, either stepped up their game regarding KYC or pretended to do so, but the market expectation is still that a defaulting user will basically never successfully recover. (Note that the legal obligation to pay is not coextensive with users actually paying. The retail speculators with $25,000 of capital that the pattern day trade rules are worried about will often not have $5,000 to cover a deficiency. On the other end of the scale, when a hedge fund blows up, the fund entity is wiped out, but its limited partners—pension funds, endowments, family offices—are not on the hook to the prime broker, and nobody expects the general partner to start selling their house to make up the difference.) So who bears the loss when the customer doesn’t, can’t, or won’t? The waterfall depends on market, product type, and geography, but as a sketch: brokerages bear the loss first, out of their own capital. They’re generally required to keep a reserve for this purpose. A brokerage will, in the ordinary course of business, have obligations to other parties which would be endangered if they were catastrophically mismanaged and could not successfully manage risk during a downturn. (It’s been known to happen, and even can be associated with assets rather than liabilities.) In this case, most of those counterparties are partially insulated by structures designed to insure the peer group. These include e.g. clearing pools, guaranty funds capitalized by the member firms of a clearinghouse, the clearinghouse’s own capital, and perhaps mutualized insurance pools. That is the rough ordering of the waterfall, which varies depending geography/product/market. One can imagine a true catastrophe which burns through each of those layers of protection, and in that case, the clearinghouse might be forced to assess members or allocate losses across survivors. That would be a very, very bad day, but contracts exist to be followed on very bad days. One commonality with crypto, though: this system is also not fully capitalized against all possible events at all times. Unlike crypto, which for contingent reasons pays some lip service to being averse to credit even as it embraces leveraged trading, the traditional industry relies extensively on underwriting risk of various participants. Many crypto advocates believe that they have something which the traditional finance industry desperately needs. Perps are crypto’s most popular and lucrative product, but they probably won’t be adopted materially in traditional markets. Existing derivatives products already work reasonably well at solving the cost of capital issue. Liquidations are not the business model of traditional brokerages. And learning, on a day when markets are 20% down, that you might be hedged or you might be bankrupt, is not a prospect which fills traditional finance professionals with the warm fuzzies. And now you understand the crypto markets a bit better. [0] Brokers trading with their own customers can happen in the ordinary course of business, but has been progressively discouraged in traditional finance, as it enables frontrunning. Frontrunning, while it is understood in the popular parlance to mean “trading before someone else can trade” and often brought up in discussions of high frequency trading using very fast computers, does not historically mean that. It historically describes a single abusive practice: a broker could basically use the slowness of traditional financial IT systems to give conditional post-facto treatment to customer orders, taking the other side of them (if profitable) or not (if not). Frontrunning basically disappeared because customers now get order confirms almost instantly by computer not at end of day via a phone call. The confirm has the price the trade executed at on it. In classic frontrunning, you sent the customer’s order to the market (at some price X), waited a bit, and then observed a later price Y. If Y was worse for the customer than X, well, them’s the breaks on Wall Street. If Y was better, you congratulated the customer on their investing acumen, and informed them that they had successfully transacted at Z, a price of your choosing between X and Y. You then fraudulently inserted a recorded transaction between the customer and yourself earlier in the day, at price Z, and assigned the transaction which happened at X to your own account, not to the customer’s account. Frontrunning was a lucrative scam while it lasted, because (effectively) the customer takes 100% of the risk of the trade but the broker gets any percentage they want of the first day’s profits. This is potentially so lucrative that smart money (and some investors in his funds!) thought Madoff was doing it, thus generating the better-than-market stable returns for over a decade through malfeasance. Of frontrunning Madoff was entirely innocent. Some more principled crypto participants have attempted to discourage exchanges from trading with their own customers. They have mostly been unsuccessful: Merit Peak Limited is Binance’s captive entity which does this. It also is occasionally described by U.S. federal agencies as running a sideline in money laundering, Alameda Research was FTX’s affiliated trading fund. Their management was criminally convicted of money laundering. etc, etc. One of the reasons this behavior is so adaptive is because the billions of dollars sloshing around can be described to banks as “proprietary trading” and “running an OTC desk”, and an inattentive bank (like, say, Silvergate, as recounted here) might miss the customer fund flows they would have been formally unwilling to facilitate. This is a useful feature for sophisticated crypto participants, and so some of them do not draw attention to the elephant in the room, even though it is averse to their interests. [1] Not all crypto trades are pre-funded. Crypto OTC transactions sometimes settle on T+1, with the OTC desk essentially extending credit in the fashion that a prime broker would in traditional markets. But most transactions on exchanges have to be paid immediately in cash already at the venue. This is very different from traditional equity market structure, where venues don’t typically receive funds flow at all, and settling/clearing happens after the fact, generally by a day or two. [2] I note, for the benefit of readers of footnote 0, that there is often a substantial gap between the time when market dislocation happens and when a trader is informed they were ADLed. The implications of this are left as an exercise to the reader. I write about the intersection of tech and finance, approximately biweekly. It's free.

Title: 'Get all that Hermes stuff now': Netflix director accused of $11 million fraud rushed to buy luxury goods, texts show

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After Carl Rinsch got an infusion of $11 million from Netflix to finish his passion project — a futuristic television series — he could sleep well at night. That's partly because he bought a $439,000 handmade mattress on what prosecutors say was on Netflix's dime. At Rinsch's criminal fraud trial in Manhattan federal court on Friday, jurors heard more about the director's spending spree from some of the people who witnessed it firsthand. His former personal assistant testified that he compared himself to a character in a movie who had 30 days to spend $30 million — or lose it all. Prosecutors also called to the stand a salesman who waxed on about the handmade Swedish mattress he sold Rinsch, complete with a "sleep doctor" to massage it for him. Rinsch liked the Hästens Grand Vividus mattress so much that he decided to buy a second one, the salesperson testified Friday. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch defrauded Netflix by misusing funds for the production of "White Horse" — a show about artificial beings who create their own society on Earth after a schism with humankind. Rinsch filmed portions of "White Horse," but went over budget and never finished a single episode. On Friday, jurors heard more testimony from Maria Skotnikova, who worked as a personal assistant for Rinsch and made logistical arrangements for the filming of "White Horse." Skotnikova said Rinsch made multiple luxury purchases after Netflix gave him an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish the project, including a rush to buy Hermes goods. "Get all that Hermes stuff now," Rinsch told Skotnikova in one August 2021 text message sent to the jury. "This is your job," he texted her a short while later. "We have to do this. Or else the money goes bye-bye. Get it." According to Skotnikova, Rinsch compared his situation to "Brewster's Millions" — the 1985 movie about a man who learns he received a $30 million windfall from a family member but must spend it all within 30 days. Skotnikova also testified Thursday about driving to meetings in Ferraris and Rolls-Royces, vehicles an FBI forensic accountant said Rinsch purchased using money that originally came from Netflix. Skotnikova said Friday that Rinsch tried to purchase a large amount of furniture from the French designer Jacques Adnet, which he considered "interesting and underappreciated." Rinsch, known for directing "Ronin 47" with Keanu Reeves, wanted to have a "monopoly" on the designer's furniture pieces so he could "control the price," Skotnikova testified. The spending spree also included over 480 food takeout orders on Postmates and Uber Eats in a six-month span in 2022. The FBI forensic accountant previously testified that Rinsch moved the funds from Netflix through different accounts, invested a portion of it in the stock market and cryptocurrency, and spent other amounts on what appeared to be personal uses. Later Friday, jurors heard from Johan Ericsson, who served as the top Hästens salesperson on the West Coast of the US. He said he met Rinsch in 2021, when the director went to the brand's Los Angeles store. Rinsch purchased four mattresses for a total of $617,610.66, records show. He received a discount because he bought floor models rather than having them individually handmade in Sweden, Ericsson said. The highlight was the Grand Vividus in the "black shadow" colorway. It was the top-of-the-line model that took over 700 hours to make, Ericsson said. The Grand Vividus is not just a mattress, but a "sleep instrument" that includes a base and leather headboard, and comes with a "bed doctor" who visits your house to massage the mattress, according to Ericsson. Rinsch was so pleased with it that he later modified his order to get an additional Grand Vividus mattress rather than three lesser Hästens models, according to Ericsson. "These are two very special beds," Ericsson said. US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is overseeing the trial, chastised prosecutors for allowing Ericsson to spend so much time on the witness stand waxing lyrical about the qualities of Hästens mattresses. "I was going to call it a sales pitch, but he obviously deeply believes in the brilliance of these mattresses," Rakoff said. Ericsson said that Rinsch never spoke with him about using the mattresses for the production of "White Horse." Rinsch's defense lawyers say he's innocent, and the case is really about a "creative genius" who was overwhelmed by the challenges of the project and didn't get the support he needed from Netflix. In a deposition for a separate legal proceeding, which was entered into evidence in the criminal trial, Rinsch was asked why he purchased "a mattress that costs $450,000 for this production." "Because it retains value," Rinsch said. "And a mattress that you spend $30,000 on is worth zilch, but a mattress that you spend $450,000 on — guess what? It's worth a hundred grand more now. So hey, what are you gonna do?" Prosecutors told Rakoff they expect to finish presenting their case on Monday. Rinsch — an engaged and jittery presence in the courtroom — hasn't said whether he will take the witness stand while his lawyers present his defense case. Jump to

Title: When Positivity Turns Toxic: How Cultures That Silence Dissent Lose Their Edge

Time Published: 2025-12-05T20:15:19Z

In his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More, historian Alexei Yurchak introduced the concept of “hypernormalization.” This describes a phenomenon in which an entire population accepts an officially sanctioned version of truth that fundamentally contradicts their lived reality. This emerged during the post-Stalin, pre-Perestroika Soviet era and was, in effect, gaslighting at a societal scale. A similar dynamic has taken hold inside many contemporary organizations, from Uber to Theranos, BrewDog to Careem, where the unrelenting, top-down insistence on happiness and positivity bears little resemblance to employees’ actual experiences in the workplace. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. A series of scandals, whistleblowing cases and public testimonies by employees at these companies illustrate what can go wrong when bosses oversell the good times and their positivity turns toxic. At Uber, for example, a sexual harassment case highlighted the stark discrepancy between the company’s espoused values and the behavior of senior leadership. At BrewDog, an open letter from former employees shed light on a stressful and fear-driven workplace culture that contradicted the utopian vision of the company and its operations promoted by its founders on social media. The core issue with organizations that demand positivity, either as a core tenet of their internal culture or as an essential mode of interacting with their customers, is that it creates a false illusion. Whatever its origins, over time, the enforced positivity becomes misguided, brittle and artificial. Employees are required to see, hear and speak no evil, while their emotional labor is translated into inauthentic performance. Doubts, frustrations and legitimate concerns are suppressed because they fail to align with the preferred narrative of how things are “supposed” to feel. Which is not to say such traits disappear. Instead, they become part of what psychologist Carl Jung called “the Shadow,” the accumulated, disowned aspects of self and system waiting for an outlet, often surfacing in ways that are corrosive and destabilizing. Far from building resilience and cohesion, then, forced optimism erodes any sense of psychological safety, leaving employees fatigued, cynical and disengaged. Performing and projecting positivity that bears no resemblance to reality is both draining and demoralizing. Amazon has long marketed itself as an upbeat company, the bringer of joy, with its ubiquitous smile logo. What its administrative personnel have witnessed in recent years, though, tells a very different story. For all the wellness programs, Mental Health America awards, and counseling opportunities made available to employees and their households, there has been a groundswell of discontent as people have adapted to post-pandemic realities. The company’s mandate requiring employees to return to the office three days per week was far from popular. Many employees had adapted well to working from home, appreciating the flexibility and work-life balance remote work afforded them. They remained unconvinced by leadership’s arguments about the benefits of physical proximity and face-to-face interaction with colleagues. Tensions escalated when rumors circulated that Amazon was preparing to extend the policy to a required five in-office days by 2025. Insights from TeamBlind’s poll of 2,585 verified Amazon employees illustrate the disconnect: 91 percent reported dissatisfaction with the return-to-office mandate, and 73 percent said they were considering leaving the company because of the change. A far from positive reaction saw some employees taking to the streets in protest, echoing earlier walkouts during the 2023 mass layoffs. More cuts followed, as Amazon pursued both bureaucratic efficiency and its rollout of generative A.I. Yet even in the Amazon case, employees felt able, if only partially, to voice their frustrations publicly. As Megan Reitz and John Higgins highlight in Speak Out, Listen Up, leaders are often unaware of how their own status and the workplace cultures they create discourage dissent, closing down discussion. Where negativity is stigmatized, there is little opportunity for challenge, debate, risk escalation or alternative thinking. Many find that when they do speak up—and certainly when they whistle blow—they are subsequently ostracized not only by senior leaders but by colleagues they were once close to as well. This pattern has repeatedly surfaced in scandals involving Uber, Theranos and Boeing. None of this is to suggest that constant criticism or unfettered negativity produces healthy cultures, and can be as toxic as forced positivity. For all the advocacy of psychological safety in recent years, there is a need for nuance and balance—it does not mean an absence of discomfort. As Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues in Don’t Be Yourself, performance pressure, friction and critical feedback all have their place and can be adapted to suit interactions with different employees. Effective leaders know when to deploy positivity as motivation and when to lean into constructive tension. After all, creative friction has fueled some of the world’s most significant breakthroughs. Without it, many transformative ideas would have never survived. The challenge—and the opportunity—is finding a middle ground between toxic positivity and unchecked venting. Healthy cultures make room for candor, dissent and complexity. They treat discomfort as information, not insubordination. They recognize that negativity, when expressed constructively, is not a threat but a necessary catalyst for progress.

Time Published: 2025-12-05T17:52:44Z
Full Content:
In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg recast Facebook as Meta and declared the metaverse—a digital realm where people would work, socialize, and spend much of their lives—the company’s next great frontier. He framed it as the “successor to the mobile internet” and said Meta would be “metaverse-first.”The hype wasn’t all him. Grayscale, the investment firm specializing in crypto, called the metaverse a “trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.” Barbados even opened up an embassy in Decentraland, one of the worlds in the metaverse. Almost five years later, that bet has become one of the most expensive misadventures in tech. Meta’s Reality Labs division has racked up more than $70 billion in losses since 2021, according to Bloomberg, burning through cash on blocky virtual environments, glitchy avatars, expensive headsets, and a user base of approximately 38 people as of 2022. For many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; the metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their phone or laptop. Despite years of investment, VR remains burdened by serious structural limitations, and for most users there’s simply not enough compelling content beyond niche gaming. Zuckerberg is now preparing to slash Reality Labs’ budget by as much as 30%, Bloomberg said. The cuts—which could translate to $4 billion to $6 billion in reduced spend—would hit everything from the Horizon Worlds virtual platform to the Quest hardware unit. Layoffs could come as early as January, though final decisions haven’t been made, according to Bloomberg. The move follows a strategy meeting last month at Zuckerberg’s Hawaii compound, where he reviewed Meta’s 2026 budget and asked executives to find 10% cuts across the board, the report said. Reality Labs was told to go deeper. Competition in the broader VR market simply never took off the way Meta expected, one person said. The result: a division long viewed as a money sink is finally being reined in. Wall Street cheered. Meta’s stock jumped more than 4% Thursday on the news, adding roughly $69 billion in market value. “Smart move, just late,” Craig Huber of Huber Research told Reuters. Investors have been complaining for years that the metaverse effort was an expensive distraction, one that drained resources without producing meaningful revenue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’srequest for comment, but it insists it isn’t killing the metaverse outright. A spokesperson told the South China Morning Post that the company is “shifting some investment from metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables,” point­ing to momentum behind its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg says have tripled in sales over the past year. But there’s no avoiding the reality: AI is the new obsession, and the new money pit. Meta expects to spend around $72 billion on AI this year, nearly matching everything it has lost on the metaverse since 2021. That includes massive outlays for data centers, model development, and new hardware. Investors are much more excited about AI burn than metaverse burn, but even they want clarity on how much Meta will ultimately be spending—and for how long. Across tech, companies are evaluating anything that isn’t directly tied to AI. Apple is revamping its leadership structure, partially around AI concerns. Microsoft is rethinking the “economics of AI.” Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are pouring billions into cloud infrastructure to keep up with demand. Signs point to money-losing initiatives without a clear AI angle being on the chopping block, with Meta as a dramatic example.

Title: Stocks Have Rebounded Ahead of the Fed Meeting—But the Market's Leaders Are Changing

The stock market may not be roaring into the most wonderful time of the year, but it is chugging along. Its next big test, however, is right around the corner. Investors' attention has for days largely been fixed on Wednesday's rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Rising optimism that the Fed will cut at its last meeting of 2025—based on futures market data, it's viewed as a near-certainty—has helped the major indexes recover most of the ground they lost during the volatile first three weeks of November; the major U.S. indexes are within a few percentage points of fresh records as this week draws to a close. A lot changed below the surface last month. The Magnificent Seven group of tech heavyweights— Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—nearly entered a technical correction as investors debated whether big tech was spending too much on artificial intelligence. On Nov. 20, a blowout earnings report from Nvidia failed to put AI bubble fears to rest, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) closed the day 9% below its record high. It's not that long ago that there was serious doubt among investors about whether the Fed would cut rates at its December meeting, the last of the year. Now it's seen as a virtual certainty. That might increase investor appetite for risk assets, but in the runup to the meeting a broader slice of stocks has been climbing. This year’s least-loved sectors, meanwhile, including healthcare and energy, became leaders. More than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index last month, compared with just 33% since the start of the year, suggesting “a change of leadership heading into 2026,” according to Bank of America analysts. Eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors outperformed the broader index, they wrote, while tech lagged. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, an index that tracks the stocks of companies that move goods and people around the country, rose for a tenth consecutive day on Friday. According to Dow Theory, that's a bullish sign for stocks if observed alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average. (The Dow Industrials rose on Friday, and is up nearly 5% over the past two weeks.) Fed officials are divided on how to proceed. Some policymakers fear that cutting rates too aggressively will stoke inflation, which has run above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years and reaccelerated in recent months. Others fear that leaving rates unchanged will harm the weakening job market, potentially tipping the U.S. economy into recession. The government shutdown delayed the release of several vital economic reports, leaving officials no choice but to fly partially blind next week. The most recent official labor market data that policymakers have sent mixed signals, but data from private sources suggest the job market has continued to soften. The private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November, according to payroll provider ADP. Employers announced more than 150,000 layoffs in October, the highest number for that month since 2003. Wall Street generally expects the Fed will prioritize employment over inflation next week, moving to bring rates lower. Investors see an 87% chance the Fed cuts interest rates, according to federal funds futures trading data. Just two weeks ago, that figure was 30%. Update—December 5, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect the end of trading on Friday.

Title: Meta Confirms "Shifting Some" Funding "From Metaverse Toward AI Glasses"
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-confirms-shifting-some-funding-from-metaverse-toward-ai-glasses/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T17:24:23Z
Full Content:
Meta has officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", following reports of an up to 30% budget cut for parts of Reality Labs. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. Yesterday, Bloomberg first reported that the division is facing up to 30% budget cuts that would primarily target VR and Horizon Worlds. Following Bloomberg's report, other mainstream news outlets including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider have published their own reports corroborating the general claim, with slightly differing details, and the NYT and BI even received an official prepared statement from Meta, which the company confirmed to UploadVR. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," the statement reads. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." Business Insider's report suggests that the cuts will primarily hit Horizon Worlds, and that employees are facing "uncertainty" about whether this will involve layoffs. One likely cut BI's report mentions is the funding for third-party studios to build Horizon Worlds content. The New York Times report, on the other hand, seems more definitive in stating that these cuts will come via layoffs. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses comes just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Next year, our sources suggest that Meta has prioritized shipping an ultralight Horizon OS headset with a tethered compute puck instead of a traditional form factor Quest 4, and the company will be closely tracking how it performs in comparison to Quest 3 and Quest 3S through 2027. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. But this doesn't seem to have gained much traction. Meta is set to roll out its Horizon Studio world creation toolset, powered by the Horizon Engine it built to replace Unity in Horizon Worlds, and the company will be closely tracking whether this meaningfully improves engagement. This relative stagnation in its Quest and Horizon Worlds efforts comes as the company is seeing skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. Back in February, in its Q4 2024 earnings call, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses had sold 2 million units, and in its Q2 2025 call in July said that sales had more than tripled since last year, performing "exceptionally well". In its Q2 2025 call in July, the company said that the glasses were performing "exceptionally well" in the market, with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. During the February call, the company also announced that its annual production capacity for smart glasses would be increased to 10 million by the end of 2026. And in its Q3 2025 sales call in October, it said that it was accelerating this target to reach the 10 million annual production rate sooner, as smart glasses drove more than a third of its quarterly growth. This combination of significant success in the smart glasses space and relative failure in growing its VR headset and metaverse platform business is likely the driver of the company's decision to shift some funding to the former, hoping to further establish itself as the leader in the space before rival products from Apple and Google arrive.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like a helicopter too heavy for lift off, tech companies are ditching anything they don't view as essential to get their AI plans off the ground. Meta is planning to cut its metaverse division's budget by as much as 30% and considering job cuts as part of the move, writes BI's Jyoti Mann and Pranav Dixit. The decision comes as tech companies look to pare back anything not directly focused on giving them an edge in the AI wars. Investors loved the move, with the stock finishing the day up almost 3.5%. For Meta, ditching the metaverse has been a long time coming. (We actually declared it dead back in checks notes May 2023.) During Meta's most recent earnings call, the word "metaverse" wasn't even used once. It's quite the reversal from when the metaverse was the literal inspiration for the entire company's rebrand from Facebook. But it's tough to keep making the case for funding something that burns billions of dollars and doesn't directly generate a ton of revenue. Especially when you need to make room for AI plans that are burning billions of dollars and have yet to directly generate a ton of revenue. Meta is unlikely to be the last company to cut non-AI-related fat. AI projects are really expensive. From hardware to talent to power, there doesn't appear to be a "cheap" way to do it. The space is also incredibly competitive, and even the first movers are feeling the heat. That's forcing companies to rethink their allocation of resources, particularly when it comes to projects that don't get them to their AI goals. Even those focused solely on AI are recalibrating their approach. OpenAI is sidelining ancillary projects to solely focus on beefing up ChatGPT. Tech companies with business lines already benefiting from the AI boom hold an advantage. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud businesses are experiencing an uptick from AI investments. Those players aren't standing still, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tapped a new advisor to "rethink the new economics of AI." Next month could be a good indication of how much tech companies are willing to throw overboard to keep their AI dreams afloat. Several companies conducted layoffs at the start of the year as part of their annual culling. Where companies draw the line will be interesting to watch. Money-losing endeavors not tied to AI will be obvious targets, but what about the stuff that is bringing in money but doesn't fit a company's future AI vision? How much will companies cut from what already is to support what could be? Jump to

Title: CoinEx Research November 2025 Report: Painvember's Brutal Reality Check

December 05, 2025 10:01 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research’s November 2025 Report: Painvember is a brutal reality check after Uptober’s euphoric highs. Profit-taking by long-term holders, sustained ETF outflows, and cascading liquidations drove the downturn, all against a risk-off macro backdrop. While the Fed’s late-month dovish pivot and progress on the Ukraine–Russia peace framework briefly improved liquidity expectations, sentiment deteriorated again due to China reaffirming its crypto ban, S&P Global downgrading USDT, and rising Japanese yields threatening a yen carry-trade unwind. Beyond Bitcoin, AI and prediction-market sectors saw heightened volatility but also meaningful innovation and on-chain activity, while stablecoin flows printed their weakest reading in nearly a year, a key inflection point that may determine whether crypto enters a short-term correction or a new multi-month bear cycle. From Euphoria to Exhaustion: The Toughest Month of 2025 Following a fresh new high in early October, where Bitcoin peaked around $126,000, the momentum of "Uptober" dissipated rapidly, giving way to intense selling pressure throughout November. The asset plunged to a low of $80,500 before closing the month at $90,300, marking a 28% drawdown from its all-time high. This correction was fueled by profit-taking from OG whales, significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, and a wave of cascading liquidations, all amplified by a broader risk-off sentiment in the macroeconomic environment. On the macro side, the Federal Reserve shifted toward a more dovish stance late in the month, with market-implied odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut on December 10 climbing to 85%. This development, alongside progress in Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, offered a glimmer of optimism for improved liquidity conditions in crypto markets. However, sentiment soured toward month-end amid several headwinds: China reaffirmed its stringent crypto ban, S&P Global downgraded Tether's USDT to its lowest "Weak" stability rating, rekindling concerns over stablecoin vulnerabilities, and rising Japanese government bond yields signaled a potential acceleration in the yen carry-trade unwind, pulling liquidity out of risk assets like Bitcoin. In our view, as crypto becomes increasingly institutionalized, macroeconomic factors will play an outsized role in dictating price action. For Bitcoin to avert a deeper bear phase, it must defend the critical $80,000–$82,000 support zone amid ongoing volatility. Key Charts to Watch BTC has remained weak this month, dipping to around $80k before rebounding. However, the overall rebound lacks strength and is highly likely to retest the $80k zone. A break below could lead to a decline toward the next key support at $73k. $ZEC failed to sustain its prior strength and retraced into a demand zone. As a move driven by fundamentals & spot demand, $ZEC’s current cycle may not yet be over—closely monitor price action at the support level. The AI Infrastructure Throne is Shaking In November, the AI sector presented a complex landscape of strong fundamentals yet escalating competition. The chip behemoth NVIDIA delivered better-than-expected earnings, but its stock price experienced significant volatility due to news that Meta plans to shift towards Google TPU chips. This sparked market concern that the monopolistic structure of AI infrastructure might be loosening. On the model front, Google formally released its flagship model, Gemini 3 Pro, boasting a 1M token context window and powerful multimodal capabilities, solidifying its position in the model arms race. Notably, China's Moonshot AI Lab also launched its kimi-k2-thinking model this month. This model, which utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, achieves high-performance inference at extremely low training costs. This marks an intensification of the global open-source AI model competition, providing the decentralized AI community with a new low-cost, high-efficiency model option. AI Bubble FUD Spills Over The volatility in the stock prices and valuations of AI giants directly impacted the cryptocurrency market through the risk sentiment transmission chain. As high-beta core assets of the US tech sector, the short-term correction in AI concept stocks triggered a broader sell-off in "Risk-On Assets." This stock-crypto market linkage was prominent in November: the decline of market leaders like NVIDIA heightened fears of an AI bubble, subsequently leading to selling pressure on the crypto market near critical price points. Crypto AI Projects also Cooking The cryptocurrency AI track remained highly active and innovative in November. Infrastructure leader Bittensor (TAO) continued to expand its subnet ecosystem and attracted institutional capital through an ETP listing in the European market, with market focus shifting to its first halving mechanism in December. In terms of compute power, Render (RNDR) officially launched its Compute Subnet, transitioning into a pure AI inference computing network. The application and agent layers saw real-world stress testing: nof1.ai's Alpha Arena Season 1.5 commenced, deploying $320,000 in real capital, pitting multiple AI models, including Gemini 3 Pro and kimi-k2-thinking, against each other in real-time cryptocurrency and US stock token trading on the Hyperliquid DEX, directly placing the AI models' investment judgment capabilities in a competitive arena. Prediction Markets Enter Normalized High-Liquidity Era The prediction market’s weekly volume exceeded $3.6 billion in November, significantly surpassing the 2024 election peak. In our view, the market has successfully transitioned from an "event-driven" model to a phase of "normalized high liquidity." Polymarket maintains its stable retail user base, while Kalshi, leveraging compliance and institutional capital, has caught up to and, in periods, overtaken Polymarket in transaction volume. The Monad-based Opinion protocol surged in Q4, rapidly capturing a significant market share and challenging the established duopoly. Polymarket Builders Ecosystem: High Concentration & Strategic Value Extreme Volume Concentration: The Builders program has created a highly concentrated structure, with Betmoar dominating the ecosystem by capturing an astonishing 68.49% of all third-party front-end transaction volume. This highlights an "extreme head effect" driven by superior UX or specific incentives. Tier 2 Differentiation: The second tier, led by Standtrade (9.8%) and Polytraderpro (7.77%), proves that specialized interfaces (e.g., Pro tools for traders) still hold significant volume and room for differentiated competition. Strategic Long Tail: The remaining volume (~14%) is held by long-tail projects (like Polycule and Matchr.xyz). Though small, these independent front-ends are critical to Polymarket's overall censorship resistance and global market penetration. Stablecoin Flows Just Printed the Most Bearish Bar in a Year Stablecoin inflows have slowed significantly, with the next period's data being extremely critical. This month, stablecoins continued to see inflows, but the volume has slowed markedly, reaching the lowest level ($1.9B) in nearly a year. The next period's data is highly critical and could lead to two possible scenarios: Economic Data & Events to Watch in December 2025 About CoinEx Established in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind.

Title: AI Update, December 5, 2025: AI News and Views From the Past Two Weeks
URL: https://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2025/54083/ai-update-december-5-2025-ai-news-and-views-from-the-past-two-weeks
Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past two weeks or so: OpenAI declares 'code red' as rivals close in on ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly declared a "code red," telling staff to urgently improve ChatGPT as competitors like Google and Anthropic catch up. The company is pausing new initiatives such as ads, shopping and health agents, and the Pulse personal assistant to focus on speed, reliability, personalization, and broader question coverage. Daily coordination calls and temporary team transfers will support the push. The move underscores intensifying competition and the challenge of funding massive AI investments while still figuring out profitability. Importance for marketers: ChatGPT's road map is shifting toward core quality rather than new surfaces. Expect rapid, sometimes disruptive, UX changes that affect integrations, content workflows, and any planning based on future ad or commerce features. Google tests merging AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. Google is testing a unified experience that connects AI Overviews with conversational AI Mode directly from the main search results page on mobile. Users who see an AI Overview at the top of results will be able to tap through and continue asking follow-up questions in an integrated chat with Gemini. Previously, people had to decide whether to start in classic search or switch into AI Mode. The experiment rolls out globally on mobile and aligns with Google's vision of frictionless, conversational information seeking. Importance for marketers: This further blurs the line between search and chat. Winning visibility means optimizing content so AI Overviews and conversational follow-ups surface your brand, not just ranking in traditional blue links. ChatGPT adds shopping research to power product discovery. OpenAI launched a shopping research feature in ChatGPT that turns product discovery into a multistep conversation. Users describe what they need, answer follow-up questions about preferences and budget, and receive a customized buyer's guide. The system pulls price, availability, specs, reviews, and images from across the web, and users can refine results by marking items as "Not interested" or "More like this." The feature, powered by a shopping-specialized GPT-5 mini variant, currently performs best in consumer categories such as electronics, beauty, home, and sports. Importance for marketers: Early-stage product comparison can now happen entirely inside ChatGPT. Retailers and brands must ensure their product data, structured content, and site visibility align with how OpenAI's shopping system discovers, evaluates, and ranks items. Retailers race to be seen by AI as holiday shopping goes agentic. Big US retailers are adapting to an AI-shaped shopping landscape, where tools like ChatGPT and Gemini recommend products alongside traditional search and ads. With most of the projected $253 billion in online holiday sales still coming through classic web journeys, AI referrals are small but growing and show higher purchase intent. Brands are experimenting with AI-only websites hidden from human shoppers, ramping up blog and Reddit content, and seeking coverage in editorial "best of" lists that scrapers ingest. Early data shows AI-driven traffic rising sharply year over year. Importance for marketers: Generative engine optimization is becoming operational reality. Teams need content, technical SEO, and reputation tactics designed explicitly to feed AI scrapers and agentic recommendation systems, not just human readers. Ads appear headed to ChatGPT's free app experience. Code discovered in a beta version of the ChatGPT Android app suggests OpenAI is preparing an ads feature, with references to "bazaar content," "search ad," and a "search ads carousel." That implies the free ChatGPT app may soon include advertising alongside or within responses. OpenAI has so far relied on subscriptions and API usage for revenue, but IT remains unprofitable and reportedly faces large funding needs to sustain its growth. CEO Sam Altman has previously said he is not opposed to ads if they are implemented carefully. Importance for marketers: If search-style ads arrive in ChatGPT, it effectively becomes a new paid media channel. Marketers should expect auction dynamics, creative formats, and measurement questions similar to search—only now embedded inside conversational experiences. DeepSeek releases open-source models that challenge GPT-5. Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled two large models, DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, claiming performance on par with or better than GPT-5 and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro on elite math, coding, and reasoning benchmarks. A sparse attention architecture dramatically cuts inference costs and supports long context windows, enabling cheaper processing of large documents. Both models, with hundreds of billions of parameters, are released under an MIT open-source license, including full weights and tooling. Regulators in Europe and the US are already scrutinizing DeepSeek over data and national security concerns. Importance for marketers: Frontier-level capabilities are moving into free, open models. This could reduce dependence on a few US providers, but also raises questions about data governance, compliance, and where sensitive customer or campaign data is processed. AI helps drive record $11.8 billion in Black Friday online sales. US Black Friday online spending hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to Adobe Analytics. AI-powered shopping tools played a major role, helping consumers navigate inflation worries, tariffs, and flat discount levels. AI-driven traffic to retail sites rose more than 800% compared with last year, aided by tools such as Walmart's Sparky and Amazon's Rufus. Globally, Salesforce estimates AI and agents influenced $14.2 billion in Black Friday online sales. Higher prices and stronger luxury demand offset fewer units per order. Importance for marketers: AI assistants now materially shape holiday commerce, from price discovery to basket composition. Brands should instrument journeys to understand AI-assisted paths to purchase and adjust promotion tactics, messaging, and merchandising accordingly. EU plans to delay high-risk AI rules until 2027 after industry pushback. The European Commission proposed delaying enforcement of stricter AI Act rules on high-risk use cases from August 2026 to December 2027. The changes, part of a broader "Digital Omnibus," aim to streamline digital regulations, cut administrative burdens, and respond to criticism from Big Tech and other businesses. Affected areas include biometric identification, hiring and exams, utilities, road traffic, health services, creditworthiness, and law enforcement. Proposed GDPR tweaks would also allow large tech firms to use Europeans' personal data to train AI models under certain conditions. Importance for marketers: The delay gives organizations extra time to align their AI-driven hiring, customer scoring, and service workflows with EU rules. However, eventual compliance is inevitable, especially for profiling, risk scoring, and use of personal data for model training. Study finds AI companies' safety practices lag global standards. A new edition of the Future of Life Institute's AI safety index concludes that major AI firms, including Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, and Meta, fall far short of emerging global safety standards. An expert panel found none had robust plans to control advanced, potentially superintelligent systems, despite rising public concern about harms such as self-harm, psychosis, and AI-enabled hacking. The report criticizes both limited regulation and aggressive lobbying against binding rules, even as companies invest hundreds of billions in new AI infrastructure. Importance for marketers: As safety narratives intensify, brands deploying AI for customer engagement, personalization, or support must show credible guardrails. Clear policies, human escalation paths, and transparent messaging about AI limitations will increasingly factor into brand trust and corporate reputation. White House pauses order that would preempt state AI laws. The Trump administration has paused a draft executive order that would have empowered the Justice Department to challenge state AI laws and threaten broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. The draft envisioned an "AI Litigation Task Force" to argue that such state rules unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. Lawmakers from both parties opposed the plan, calling it an attack on state efforts to address fraud, deepfakes, and child abuse imagery. Critics said it would prioritize AI industry concerns over consumer protections. Importance for marketers: The pause preserves a patchwork of state-level AI rules for now. Brands using AI in advertising, personalization, and content generation still need to track state regulations and avoid assuming a single federal standard will override local restrictions. EU edges toward banning social media and AI chatbots for those under 16 who don't have consent. The European Parliament adopted a nonbinding resolution calling for a ban on social media for teens under 16 without parental consent, extending to AI chatbots due to mental health concerns. The move aligns Europe with Australia's stricter youth protections and follows French President Emmanuel Macron's criticism of addictive algorithms and "Wild West" platforms. Implementation details remain unclear, but the plan may rely on a digital identity wallet for age verification, requiring teens to re-verify regularly. Critics warn of a pervasive "digital checkpoint" infrastructure. Importance for marketers: Youth-focused campaigns in Europe could face dramatic access and targeting changes. Age-gating, consent workflows, and channel strategies for teen audiences will need to adapt to stricter verification regimes and possibly reduced reach. EU opens antitrust probe into Meta's AI plans for WhatsApp. The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Meta over policies that may restrict rival AI assistants on WhatsApp, giving an advantage to Meta's own Meta AI. Complaints from smaller companies alleged that changes to access rules could block competing chatbots from reaching users on the platform. EU officials are considering interim measures and note that the case is separate from, but complementary to, digital gatekeeper rules under the Digital Markets Act. Italy's antitrust authority is running a parallel investigation. Importance for marketers: If WhatsApp becomes more locked down around Meta's AI, access to users through third-party assistants could narrow. Brands betting on independent AI agents for messaging campaigns and customer service must track how platform owners control AI distribution and integrations. Anthropic launches Claude Opus 4.5 for enterprise-grade coding and analysis. Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.5, its newest flagship model, tailored for professional developers and knowledge workers such as analysts and consultants. Opus 4.5 follows recent releases of Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 and is positioned as state-of-the-art for agentic coding tasks, outperforming rivals like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.1 on SWE-bench Verified. Anthropic says the model excels at working with spreadsheets, slide decks, and deep research, and will serve as the default for its Pro, Max, and Enterprise offerings. Importance for marketers: Stronger coding and analysis capabilities make it easier to automate campaign reporting, dashboard building, and data exploration. Enterprise teams can offload more operational work to AI and redirect human effort toward brand, creative, and strategy. Anthropic introduces Claude for Nonprofits with steep discounts and connectors. Anthropic, in partnership with GivingTuesday, launched Claude for Nonprofits to help resource-constrained organizations adopt AI. Eligible nonprofits can receive up to 75% off Team and Enterprise plans, with access to Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.5 on request. The program includes open-source connectors to Benevity, Blackbaud, and Candid, plus a free AI Fluency for Nonprofits course via Anthropic Academy. Partners such as Bridgespan and Vera Solutions will support strategy and implementation. Importance for marketers: Nonprofit marketing and development teams gain access to enterprise-grade AI at lower cost. That can raise expectations for content quality, grant output, donor personalization, and reporting even in smaller organizations, reshaping benchmarks for nonprofit communications and fundraising. Mistral debuts new large and small models to stay in the AI race. French AI startup Mistral released a new suite of models, including Mistral 3, which it calls the world's best open-weight multimodal, multilingual large model, and a compact Ministral 3 model for devices, robots, and drones. The company, recently valued at 11.7 billion euros after a funding round led by ASML and Nvidia, positions the models for agents, retrieval-augmented systems, and complex enterprise workflows. Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, lowering costs and supporting on-device use without network access. Importance for marketers: Mistral's open-weight models expand options beyond US giants, especially in Europe. Flexible deployment on devices and lower-cost infrastructure could enable more localized, privacy-conscious AI experiences in campaigns and customer touchpoints. Nvidia takes $2 billion stake in Synopsys to deepen AI design tools. Nvidia has invested $2 billion in chip design software maker Synopsys, acquiring about 4.8 million shares in a private placement and becoming one of its largest shareholders. The expanded tie-up will see Synopsys use Nvidia's developer tools and libraries to build AI-powered applications for chip design, verification, and other electronic design automation tasks. The deal follows a string of major AI investments by Nvidia, including stakes in OpenAI and Intel. Synopsys shares rose on the news while Nvidia's dipped slightly. Importance for marketers: Nvidia's growing influence across the AI hardware and software stack could reinforce its position as the default infrastructure layer. Over time, this may affect model availability, pricing, and performance for SaaS tools and marketing platforms your teams depend on. ByteDance launches Doubao-powered AI voice assistant on ZTE phones. ByteDance is introducing an AI voice control tool, powered by its Doubao large language model, that will debut on ZTE's Nubia M153 smartphone before rolling out to other manufacturers. Users will be able to find content and book tickets via voice, competing with AI features from Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple's Apple Intelligence is not yet available in China, though Alibaba has announced collaboration plans. ByteDance stresses it will not build its own phones and is partnering across the ecosystem. Importance for marketers: In China, voice AI entry points are diversifying beyond a single platform. For brands targeting Chinese consumers, discoverability strategies must consider device-level assistants and super-app ecosystems, not just search or social. Wikipedia seeks more AI licensing deals to cover scraping costs. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales says the nonprofit is negotiating additional licensing agreements with AI companies, similar to its existing deal with Google, to offset infrastructure costs from heavy AI crawling. High-volume automated access forces Wikipedia to pay for more servers and memory, even though its content remains free to individuals. Wales argues donors did not intend to subsidize multibillion-dollar AI products, and suggests technical tools like Cloudflare's AI Crawl Control may limit bots if companies do not pay. Importance for marketers: As key knowledge sources demand compensation or restrict access, training data and content availability may shift. Brands that rely on reference-style content, UGC, or wikis should anticipate changing terms for how AI systems can use and quote that material. Amazon workers warn about an all-costs-justified AI strategy. More than 1,000 Amazon employees have anonymously signed an open letter criticizing the company's "all-costs-justified" AI push. Organized by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the petition warns that AI investments risk fueling layoffs, environmental damage from energy-hungry data centers, and abuse in surveillance and deportation contexts. Workers say executives overstate AI benefits while downplaying internal dissatisfaction and climate impact. Signers include senior engineers, product leaders, marketers, and warehouse staff, many of whom fear retaliation in a more restrictive internal climate. Importance for marketers: Internal resistance to AI rollouts can affect brand reputation, recruiting, and customer trust. Marketers must factor employee sentiment and social responsibility into how they communicate AI initiatives, both externally and in employer branding. Amazon pulls AI anime dubs after fan and creator backlash. Amazon's Prime Video quietly rolled back a beta program that used AI to generate English and Spanish dubs for several anime titles; the move came after fierce criticism from fans and voice actors. The AI dubs, seen as undermining human performers and delivering poor quality, triggered online outrage, including high-profile critiques from well-known dub actors. Some English AI dubs have been removed, though certain Spanish versions remain. The episode follows broader industry hesitation around visible generative AI use in films and television. Importance for marketers: Audiences can strongly reject AI-generated creative work if it feels like cost-cutting at the expense of quality or livelihoods. For brand content, transparency, creative standards, and collaboration with human talent are essential to avoid reputational blowback. OpenAI to acquire Neptune for deeper training analytics. OpenAI has agreed to acquire Neptune, a startup that builds monitoring and debugging tools for AI model training workflows. The two companies already collaborated on a metrics dashboard for foundation-model teams. Neptune will wind down its external services, and terms of the deal were not disclosed. OpenAI plans to integrate Neptune's fast, precise analysis system into its training stack to expand visibility into how models learn. The acquisition joins a string of OpenAI deals aimed at strengthening internal tooling and capabilities. Importance for marketers: Better training analytics can translate into more reliable, capable models powering the tools marketers use daily. Over time, that may mean fewer unexplained failures, more consistent output quality, and faster iteration on new features in marketing and creative platforms. Russian tech leader compares AI power to a new nuclear club. Alexander Vedyakhin, first deputy CEO of Russia's Sberbank, argues that AI will create a "nuclear club" of nations with their own large language models, conferring influence comparable to nuclear technology. He says Russia must maintain at least two or three homegrown models for sensitive domains and cannot rely on foreign systems. Vedyakhin claims Sberbank's GigaChat models rival top Western systems but warns that energy and infrastructure demands make AI investment risky and potentially unprofitable, especially amid sanctions and limited hardware access. Importance for marketers: Geopolitical competition around AI may drive national preferences and restrictions on which models can be used in certain markets. Global brands should anticipate localization requirements, data residency rules, and political sensitivities around AI vendor choice. Trump's Genesis Mission aims to use AI for scientific and energy breakthroughs. President Trump signed an executive order launching the "Genesis Mission," billed as the largest mobilization of US scientific resources since Apollo. The Department of Energy will build an AI-enabled platform to support research in areas such as energy, national security, and drug discovery. Officials say AI will automate experiments, speed simulations, and generate predictive models to cut energy costs and accelerate breakthroughs. The initiative has no public cost estimate but promises new partnerships with companies, including Nvidia and Dell. Importance for marketers: Large government-backed AI programs can accelerate innovation in energy, healthcare, and infrastructure, indirectly creating new markets and narratives. Marketers in B2B and public sector contexts should watch where funding flows, as it will shape future demand, partnership opportunities, and policy direction.

Title: Dragon Age Day Comes And Goes In Complete Silence Just One Year After Veilguard
URL: https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-day-bioware-layoffs-december-4-2000650888
Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:55:18Z
Full Content:
Dragon Age: The Veilguard December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWareâs fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. Dragon Age: The Veilguard was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare released the gameâs incredible character creator for free and broke down early player choices on social media. This year? There wasnât a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won âBest Gameâ at the Game Awards. If you look at BioWareâs Dragon Age social accounts, the last time the studio used the gameâs X account was to repost an ad for The Veilguard on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developerâs official blogâs last post was on November 7, celebrating Mass Effectâs equivalent âholiday,â N7 Day, which had a small update on the upcoming fifth game and the Amazon television series. Youâll find no such post about Dragon Age. BioWare has admitted itâs become a one-game studio after massive layoffs back in January, so there is no fifth Dragon Age game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG seriesâ past.Â If youâre only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel itâs actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on Dragon Age, itâs another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development. In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and Dragon Age: The Veilguard was thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the Dragon Age team felt like it wasnât treated fairly by the broader company. The Veilguardâs messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.Â After the game didnât reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on Mass Effect, and implied that The Veilguard may have reached a broader audience if it had stayed a live service game no one asked for. So perhaps itâs for the best that BioWare didnât acknowledge Dragon Age this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.Â At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens.

Title: Report: Meta planning massive cuts to Reality Labs metaverse division

Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:01:58Z

Company expected to redirect investment to augmented reality glasses Tech giant Meta is reportedly looking to make cuts in its Reality Labs metaverse division, the home of the Quest VR headest and the Horizon Worlds platform. That's according to Bloomberg, which reports that execs at the company are eying up budget reductions of as much as 30% during 2026. Layoffs might be take place as early as January. The company is planning cuts across the board, but more extensively to the metaverse division because it has not seen significant competition in the space, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. Investors and analysts have been demanding the company reduce its heavily lossmaking investments in the sector, which run at billions of dollars per quarter. The firm is reportedly not looking to abandon its metaverse plans, but is moving the money it is saving with these cuts into its augmented reality glasses, currently produced in partnership with Ray-Ban, according to additional reporting by the New York Times. “Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio, we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse towards AI glasses and wearables, given the momentum there. We aren’t planning any broader changes than that,” a Meta spokesperson told the FT. Following the Bloomberg report, the company's stock shot up 5.5% when the markets opened on Thursday morning, suggesting investor approval for the changes. Meta's share price ended the day 3.4% higher. In February 2025, Meta disclosed that despite its Meta Quest hardware yielding $1.08 billion in revenue, the Reality Labs division recorded a $4.97 billion loss. This part of the company has been in the red for much of its existence and lost over $70 billion since the company pivoted to focus on the metaverse. For the three months ending September 30, 2025, Meta reported a $4.4 billion operational loss – largely in line with the previous year's figures – while for the nine months ending September 30th, this loss comes to $13.2 billion, a 3% increase year-on-year. Meta CFO Susan Li told investors that the company expected lower Reality Labs revenue for its Q4, which ends on December 30, 2025. Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms back in 2021, such was Zuckerburg and co.'s conviction that the metaverse was the future of digital communication. Despite Meta's more recent focus on AI, the company announced last month that it was cutting 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. The cuts would be the latest in a series of significant job losses at the company. In January of this year, Meta cut 5% of its workforce, estimated to be around 3,600 staff, while in 2023, it laid off 10,000 workers and retired 5,000 open roles.

Oracle debt is spiraling toward 2008-era danger, with five-year CDS jumping to 125 bps and possibly hitting 200 bps in 2026 as AI spending soars. Oracle’s debt has surged to $104 billion in FY2025 and may hit $290 billion by FY2028 as free cash flow turns negative for the first time since 1999. Ratings outlook is now negative. Other hyperscalers remain stronger with large cash reserves. AI capex is rising fast to $600 billion by 2027, intensifying credit risks.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As an avid Apple Music user, I felt left out on Spotify Wrapped Day earlier this week. Most of my Spotify-using friends and coworkers gleefully swapped musical tastes all day long as I sat on the outside. "But Apple has an intuitive interface and superior audio quality," I mumbled into my coffee, to no one in particular. As it turns out, retail investors have been similarly treating Apple like an afterthought. During the shortened Thanksgiving week, they piled into every Magnificent 7 stock but Apple, pulling $96 million out, according to JPMorgan data. (For context, Nvidia led inflows with $650 million.) What's more, JPMorgan found that day traders have been consistent sellers of Apple throughout the year. This matches data from Schwab showing that its clients were net sellers of Apple during the third quarter. The reason is relatively straightforward to anyone who's followed the AI race this year: Apple is behind — or at least that's the perception investors have. While fellow contestants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta loudly pile tens of billions of dollars into AI and ink huge deals with one another, Apple has been its typically quiet self. The secrecy and painstaking caution that helped the company create and mass-manufacture some of the world's most ubiquitous consumer products is now viewed as a drawback. Apple's competitors are growing more aggressive, and it's struggling to match that energy. Reflective of cooling retail interest is middling stock performance for Apple, especially by its high standards. It's up 12% year to date, trailing the S&P 500 by almost five percentage points. This is a company that's exceeded a 30% annual return in five of the last six years! And it's not just retail investors getting cold feet about Apple. Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its holding in the company by two-thirds from its peak position (although the stock remains Berkshire's top holding by value). Viking Global went as far as to offload its entire stake in the fourth quarter of last year. As for how it's going at Apple right now, it's hard to ignore the exit of the company's AI chief. Sure, there's a talent war raging in the industry, but Apple has more cash on hand than most small nations. If it wanted to pay up to keep key people, it could. It also doesn't help that criticism is coming from high places. A co-creator of the tech behind Siri recently said it was a misstep to make the AI agent voice-only. Still, I'd stop short of breaking out the violins for Apple. It remains an undeniable juggernaut. But it does have newly resurgent Alphabet nipping at its heels, and Microsoft isn't far behind. It could soon lose its spot as the second-most-valuable company. Ultimately, there's a difference between being a mega-profitable behemoth and also having your stock price trounce peers and go straight up forever. Apple eventually might have to settle for the former. Jump to

Title: Reddit's CEO says the platform is ditching a key part that 'sucks'

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reddit is getting rid of one of its oldest fixtures. The platform's CEO, Steve Huffman, said in a post that Reddit would be removing its r/popular feed from the homepage for new users to promote a more personalized and relevant user experience. The popular feed, located on the left sidebar of the website, displays the most liked recent posts across the platform. "In theory, it's what's most popular on Reddit, but it's actually what is liked by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing," he said. "Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO)." He summed up his disdain for the feature by saying, "r/popular sucks, and we're moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds." Huffman, who has been the platform's CEO since 2015, said Reddit would stop showing the popular feed in the sidebar unless users read it regularly. He said his favorite part of Reddit was that every community on the platform had its own unique culture, rules, and sense of humor. "And if your perspective isn't represented, you can create the community you want to see," he said. "The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit." The platform gets 116 million visitors daily, he said. Reddit's stock price has risen about 44% in the past year. In the post, he announced a few other changes, like limiting the number of high-traffic communities a single person can moderate, and changing the way it shows community sizes. "These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today," he said. This is not Reddit's first effort to nudge its users into smaller community groups, as it recalibrates its platform alongside competitors like Quora, and beyond that, the likes of Meta. In October, Reddit removed its public chat feature and urged users to chat on private group chats as a way to "connect with communities in smaller, focused spaces." Jump to

Title: A Meta Success; From Paradise To Ad Placements

Next Verse Remember when it seemed like the metaverse was going to be the next big thing in immersive technology and internet marketing? Yeah, about that. Four years after rebranding itself for this seemingly inevitable future, Meta has announced plans to significantly cut back on metaverse spending within its Reality Labs division. Bloomberg reports that Reality Labs, which includes the Quest VR device and “Meta Horizon Worlds” product, could see potential budget cuts as high as 30% and layoffs as early as January. Instead, that money will likely be redirected to Meta’s other potentially groundbreaking, definitely-not-just-hype-powered projects, like its AI initiatives and wearable smart glasses. “It’s not that marketers were necessarily wrong to be fascinated by Meta’s metaverse vision – just that the ending was obvious from the start, if we’re being honest with ourselves. To paraphrase “Folding Ideas” creator Dan Olson, the modern internet already handles most of the functions envisioned within the original sci-fi concept of the metaverse, so the idea that people are going to wander around in what is essentially a badly rendered, purposeless MMO game was never going to be sustainable. In other words, you’re probably better off putting your ad dollars in Roblox instead. Apple’s Road Map For Road Maps They say you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone, and that might be truest of all when talking about ads. They paved paradise and put up … search ads. Back in October, Apple started hinting that Apple Maps – a heretofore ad-free platform – will introduce search ads next year, much to the chagrin of many users. It’s a fitting metaphor, really – because there’s only so much real estate left online. No wonder marketers are getting desperate. As search traffic continues to plummet, their online advertising budgets “[have] to go somewhere,” Raj Lala, VP of US sales and development at Vistar Media, tells Emarketer. Navigation platforms are likely to be one of those places, he observed. But on a brighter note for consumers, most people find location-based ads less invasive than those that track browser history. Plus, Apple is good at “ensuring that the brands that are surfacing in these environments are going to be highly vetted, filtered and relevant,” said Lala. That’s something. At least when you see a dozen sponsored results for “restaurants near me” next time you open Apple Maps, the restaurants really will be near you. Go With The Stream Advertisers will never successfully end the fragmentation of streaming media for one simple reason: Roku, Paramount, Netflix, Comcast et al. will never agree to expose their data to cross-channel buyers. The more realistic option is not that they share data, but that the biggest players keep buying up smaller services until only a manageable handful of platforms remain. This has already been happening for some time, albeit slowly. Disney consolidated Fox and Hulu, while Amazon Prime Video bought MGM Studios. And now there’s another big prize on the table in the form of Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast are bidding for a chance to fold HBO Max and the WBD studio archive into their own libraries. For CTV advertisers who only want quality supply, the entity that ends up acquiring a service like HBO matters a lot, including their approach to ad load, the types of ad formats they offer and their ad-supported subscriber counts. On the other hand, Paramount CEO David Ellison just sent a letter denouncing WBD’s deal process, The Wall Street Journal reports, calling it “tilted and unfair.” The unspoken wild card here, though, is party politics. The Ellisons are allies of President Trump and Paramount boasts of having the cleanest, easiest path to an approved deal. Netflix has the highest bid for WBD, but Reid Hoffman, the company’s co-founder and former CEO, is a Democratic donor. Maybe the future of streaming media comes down less to CPMs and more to campaign contributions. But Wait! There’s More Cyber Monday takes the cake for the biggest online shopping day of the year.

He uses a 'possible, plausible, probable' framework to assess Nvidia's revenue needs and warns of the 'Big Market Delusion' in AI, where aggregate valuations outstrip realistic revenue potential.
